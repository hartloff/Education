B000H00VBQ,Carol T,5,I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch "grown up" television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime.
B000H00VBQ,J. Kaplan "JJ",4,Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable.
B000H0X79O,Kansas,5,This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up. The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great. I had the best laughter I have had in a long time.
B000H0X79O,Louis V. Borsellino,3,Not bad.  Didn't know any of the comedians but first time viewing put a smile on my face.  I'll check out the next season soon.
B000H29TXU,Amazon Customer,4,I love the variety of comics.  Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode.  Many of the featured comics have gone on to even bigger TV specials so it's great to see some of their earlier material.
B000H29TXU,Cathy P.,3,comedy is a matter of taste. this guy was a little funny but there are others that are far funnier than this guy
B000H29TXU,Emily Booth,5,Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart!  He makes me laugh.  The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart.
B000H29TXU,James Westervelt,2,he's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations.
B000H2DMME,Kansas,5,All the comedians are hilarious. I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together. I love Amazon prime and I love their shows. They are so much better than Netflix. I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way.
B000H2DMME,mari franks,5,Very funny. Some of the comedians were funnier than the others. We were laughing so hard the dog thought something was wrong with us
B000H2DMME,Ray Shiva,5,Great variety of good comics. Each show is just the right length to not get boring. The comics are really funny too.
B000H2DMME,Rugby,3,It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.
B000H4YNM0,Chad A. Barts "Chadillac",5,Season 2 of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is mandatory for anyhow who watches the show to own. This season has some of the greatest episodes in Sunny history!
B000H4YNM0,Consumer 45,5,Each episode gives me more entertainment than anything else on the tube. though I may not  want to have these characters as real friends - the women are hot though - the plots and characters make for great viewing.Do not see myself abandoning this series.I give 5 stars to every episode and season of Always Sunny in Philadelphia!Thanks Amazon!
B000H4YNM0,Donna Smith,5,Got these for my son's birthday. He says they are great! They are funny so give them a try! OK!
B000H4YNM0,gary blakely,1,maybe i just dont get it...but crude not funny and irritating most of the time....guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV
B000H4YNM0,Grace11,5,Gave this to a good friend and ordered another for myself.  Very funny!  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys irony and a good laugh.
B000H4YNM0,Lee DeBree,4,I enjoyed the first season a lot. The 4 main characters are very funny with their self centered ways. The second season they added Danny Devito  (Frank Reynolds) as the deranged father figure. Now most of the story lines revolve around him. Not as funny. Maybe it's better to just leave well enough alone.
B000H4YNM0,N. Dillon "International reader",5,I wish I were a part of this cast. This is the funniest stuff ever. YOU MUST GET THIS IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD &#34;SUNNY&#34; FAN!
B000H4YNM0,Sydney Domville,5,I love this show and I don't think that will ever change.  I hate all of the characters and I mean that in the best way.  Hilarious.
B000HAB4NK,Amazon Customer,5,Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001.  Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream.  I've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks!  Will keep you on the edge of your seat (if you suspend reality a little bit).  Highly recommend!
B000HAB4NK,Bill E. Bissett,5,Non stop action with edge of your seat thrilling plots with a new turn every minute.  Cast of great stars keep all events seeming like weeks but actually are in 24 hours
B000HAB4NK,Donkey,5,I had a hard time following this show when it was on TV but now that it is on Prime I can watch the episodes in a row without commercial interruption. I now can watch all of them at my leisure. I am so excited that I can't wait for another day to watch more! And I think Keifer Sutherland makes the show. I would like to tell all viewers out there that you should be on Prime because all of these episodes are for free with your membership. Many of your TV episode series are for free and tons of movies. So you all out there join Amazon Prime!
B000HAB4NK,Edna M. Dooley "Doolster",5,This show is like a runaway train ride. Every episode has poor Jack in some death defying crisis. Really enjoyed the ride.
B000HAB4NK,K. Munsey,5,Absolutely great show! Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Makes it very hard to turn it off!
B000HAB4NK,M.A.,5,I particularly like the fact that the show (which I missed when broadcast) subtly introduces the moral dilemmas of the situations.
B000HAB4NK,Steve Lawrence,5,By now I've gotten into 24 pretty deep. I like the intensity of this real time format. I really enjoy watching Jack save the world.
B000HAB4NK,St Johns,4,I enjoyed nearly all the seasons of 24 and this is probably my third year I have watched them.  So excited they are bringing the show back though it may be somewhat different.  I enjoy dramas such as &#34;24&#34; and &#34;Covert Affair&#34;.  Good luck to the 24 actors and crew and hope the new show will do well.
B000HAB4NK,youbebest,5,great acting.  Lot of cliff  hangers.  good direction. absorbing - couldn't stop watching it.  i would recommend it to anyone.
B000HKWE3O,K. A. Morgan "book relisher",5,MacGyver can work his way out of anything with his knowledge of physics.  He is a master of problem solving.  I think everyone would enjoy seeing his stories.
B000HKWE3O,MICKEYY,4,It was  Good and funny I enjoy it it is worth watching a family movie Just enjoy  very light  Enjoy
B000HKWE3O,Wayne A. Seavolt,5,James Bond minus the adult stuff.  Great show that shows the mind is still the best weapon.  Sure there is some liberal stuff thrown in but it is family friendly.  And who can't resist the MacGyverisms as you think could that work.  Maybe not but it will make the kids think and want to experiment.  Good stuff for the whole family.
B000HZEHL6,Amy S. Hayley,5,What happened with Tony and the plague he was dying from.  HELP!  It's killing me to know!!!!!!!!!!
B000HZEHL6,Betty J. Conner,5,We have watched the first and second season and we love the series.  We are now watching the third season and just like the first two we love the NCIS Team and the plots are excellent.
B000HZEHL6,C. Carnrike "book keeper",5,Started watching NCIS marathon on USA Channel (had never watched the show) and got hooked.  I have since purchased every season through Amazon and am enjoying every episode.  Great show.
B000HZEHL6,D. C. Holbrook "Dee",5,Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com. I have used this feature many times and will do again. Would highly recommend to friends and family.
B000HZEHL6,Kris,5,This said it was used but you couldn't tell. The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new. Would order from them again.
B000HZEHL6,nelly123,5,Great storylines and very believable great i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years and love the show
B000HZEHL6,Robsy,4,I love this show!  It is interesting and is a show I have great fun watching with my dad when he has time off.  The characters are funny and the banter is excellent.
B000HZEHL6,TL in SB,5,We love NCIS and all the seasons are great.  Anyone who enjoys the characters will like this season.  Beware of scenes in the autopsy room.
B000I5PVD8,dvdjhll,2,I used to watch this as a kid. We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm. They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows. It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made.
B000I5PVD8,I Teach Typing,4,This is a great example of the &#34;Dr being stuck in ancient earth&#34; theme that shows up over and over in the decades that follow.  Other than the time travel there is not much science fiction here.  It is very interesting to see the Dr interacting with his &#34;crew&#34; and how he is more like the captain of a ship rather than the more active character that he becomes over time.  Probably the most interesting thing about this episode is how it shows the cultural mores of the 1960s.  If you enjoy ancient TV this is a gem.  If you are expecting anything like the modern Dr you probably want to skip ahead a couple decades.
B000I5PVD8,Lori "lolepere",4,I rated this a 4 star because the film was grainey.  I suppose this is the best it could be after all of these years.  What a treat you start learning about Dr. Who's start
B000I5PVD8,Richard A. Luc "Luke",3,starting with an actor who was noted for military roles and still going on today Dr. Who is part of many of our lives.The original shows were on miniscule budgets and demanded a lot more imagination from the viewers than today's shows.The Aztecs in this show were probably more comfortable on the London Underground than in the Central American jungles but that doesn't matter.The Doctor is a far cry from today's version-  with no real alien identity (two movies had him as definitely an elderly Earthman)- but that didn't matter- kids loved it and more than a couple of their parents too!.A captivating history lesson
B000I5Q0ZG,greg,5,The Doctor is the longest running si fi on television and there is little dout as to why. It's great.
B000I5RENI,greg,5,The best and lonest running sifi on tv ever. I have been a fan since 1970s. I think my wife loves it more them myself.
B000I5RENI,notwing,5,enjoyed all episodes of season 16 I only hope it continues with 2014(season 56) cant wait for it to appear
B000I5RENI,watchman,5,The writing in this season is amazingly well done. As is the acting. The character actors playing the bad guys and the heroes accompanying the Doctor are top notch.
B000I62JFU,Eric Schneider,3,Everything has to start somewhere but as a viewer there is only so much nostalgia one can have for sci-fi.  Thus is a 50 year old season and it shows.  Campy at best.  If you want a good starting point for Dr. Who I suggest starting with Dr. #3 in app 1970.  This is also the start of color. That being said seeing Cybermen as an original 'bad guy' shows the connection to the past.
B000I62JFU,Marc W. Gilbertson,5,A great show about the Cybermen.  The episode centers around the tomb of the cybermen and the old look of them is pretty cool.  I only wish there were more episodes in the AMAZON library.
B000I8FOZA,Douglas Tyler,5,I appreciate technology and seeing the dreams fot the future.  I will watch additional Extreme Engineering seasons.  thank you for tne presentation.
B000I8FOZA,Jason Nobody,1,Couldn't even finish &#34;Sky City&#34; - it just feels like a sales pitch. Just get to the extreme engineering people.
B000I8FOZA,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",4,Love to see where men build and keep striving for better.  It's nice to live in a day when things naturally progress.
B000I8FOZA,Lurch,4,Not the best show ever made but you do learn.  I would love more in depth info but I do understand there is only so much that a show can divulge.  But I will say you will learn a lot and some episodes are done very well others not so well.  But hey give it a shot you may have an engineer in you waiting to get out.
B000I8H2ZU,Amazon Customer,5,These guys are great and they have a fantastic team. There have been a couple of knock-off shows that weren't even in the same galaxy as the Mythbusters. I would give 7 stars if I could!!
B000I8H2ZU,Margaret G. Louk "loves music",5,These guys are a little bit crazy.  It is a fun series to watch.  You never know what they are going to do.
B000I8H2ZU,Some Guy,5,I've always enjoyed Mythbusters. Glad this show has gone as long as it has because I can always pull up an episode and be entertained even though I've seen most of them before.
B000I9S5BE,Christine Vogelsang,5,This is great for my grandchildren.  As an educator I know how important it is to encourage children to think and problem solve.  That is exactly what this show does.  My 22 month old twin grandchildren love it and it is the only show they are allowed to watch.
B000I9S5BE,greg,5,My grandbaby loved this show very much. She still looks for spots all over the place. She was mezmarized totaly.
B000I9S5BE,gregory,5,Really? have you ever met a kid who didn't like watching this show whether with joe now or steve in the past?
B000I9S5BE,Kindle Customer,5,I love this program.  The kids get so involved in the entire show. I really chuckle as the little ones really think they can be interactive.
B000I9S5BE,Louis Diana,5,Very instructional and cute. Both my 7 year old and 1 1/2 year old love the show! More seasons for Prime members to stream!!
B000I9S5BE,Melanie C Wiitanen,5,My daughter (5) really enjoys this show. It's colorful and interactive. She gets to help Blue (the dog) solve problems.
B000I9S5BE,M.G.,5,Such fun and so educational. Perfect show for toddler.  I love to watch the learning. Highly suggest this show for supplemental learning.
B000I9S5BE,Michael Hayes,5,Awesome tv series. My son loves blue clues. Wish it was on more often. He likes then one where Blue talks in the videos too
B000I9S5BE,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,My grandson ask to watches this all the time.  He is a big fan of this show.  The streaming is excellent so the picture quality and sound is clear.
B000I9S5BE,pj ellen,5,My 2 and 3 year old grandsons love Blue's Clues.  I bought Season 1 and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  They like to sit in Nana's lap and watch Blue and Steve....and it gives Nana a good excuse to hold and rock the boys.
B000I9S5BE,Tabitha,5,i grew up watching blues clues and now my daughter can enjoy the great music and teachings from fun blue
B000I9S5BE,TIna Cubero,5,This is a great edicational show. My kids have watched the entire run of blues clues. They love to watch blue and Steve
B000I9TWV6,Amazon Customer,5,Well if my two year old had a say she would give it ten stars. I think the show has gotten better since it's introduction. I don't mind her watching it at all and the fact that she surprised me by counting to 5 in Spanish says a lot.
B000I9TWV6,Amazon Customer,5,What is bad about Dora.  Not one thing.  This is my grand children's all time favorite.  The first thing out of their mouths are &#34;I need Dora &#34;. Recommend to anyone
B000I9TWV6,Charlotte Puderbaugh,5,The colors are bright and cheerful. Great story lines.kkeps a child's attention while teaching them life lessons.My grand child really learns a lot from this show
B000I9TWV6,Debbifaye,5,The little short videos is just right for her.  It helps her learn to count and limited Spanish as well as sequencing. Very helpful for learning to read.
B000I9TWV6,DStoor,5,My 4 yr old loves Dora and always enjoys going on adventures. She also like to speak other languages and thinks it is so cool.
B000I9TWV6,DVSRomad,5,Entertaining and informative for the young minds. Granddaughter already is counting to 10 in Spanish and has picked up several words (colors).  She is only 2.
B000I9TWV6,Erin "sneimraej",4,my child loves it.  It is the ABC animal episode.  We don't generally like Dora but this specific episode is really cute and keeps my little guys attention.
B000I9TWV6,exwyzee8,3,I like the show because you can learn Spanish words and that is good exposure for my 3 year old. The show is good for very young children but it is a very simple show.
B000I9TWV6,E. Yeager,4,The grandkids really love Dora the Explorer and is a very good way to learn beginning Spanish a language that they will probably need later on in life.
B000I9TWV6,Jenny K Carney,5,My son loves this show. He is always asking "more Dora more Dora" I like how the show will pick up where u last left off
B000I9TWV6,Jon O "Health Care Worker",4,Age appropriate cartoon packed with learning for my little ones. great job with the show options amazon prime. well done
B000I9TWV6,Kerry,5,I am a nanny an the little girl love this show. Every time we go shopping she screams backpack (what she calls Dora) when she see it.
B000I9TWV6,Kindle Customer,5,My kids enjoy this show.  I like that it's got some educational value and isn't annoying for me to watch with them.
B000I9TWV6,Kindle MomLKS,5,My girls ages 3 and 4 absolutely love Dora and they enjoy these episodes from season 2. They stream easily on the Roku.
B000I9TWV6,Lynda Norton "Highland Enthusiast",5,My grandson LOVES Dora the Explorer and he learns a bit of Spanish too which really isn't the goal of watching this program.
B000I9TWV6,M0ng0l13,3,After watching Dora for the last +10 years! I have Kids ages 3-16!Good for kids. Lots of stuff to learn.
B000I9TWV6,Manismi,5,Both my sons love watching Dora. The language is appropriate for 3-5 year old kids and boots is an awesome addition to the characters.
B000I9TWV6,Mark and Lindsay,4,My kids love to interact with Dora. Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show.
B000I9TWV6,mjordan,5,My grandsons love Dora.  I find myself watching right along with them and learning new words.  If you have a preschooler please try Dora.  She is fun and entertaining.
B000I9TWV6,MT,5,Great show for young kids. My thee year old son loves Dora & Diego. Educational & entertaining for kids & will make them want to sing.
B000I9TWV6,patriciavonhartmann,5,Educational and entertaining to the grandkids. Would recommend for anyone with preschoolers. Hope to see more seasons in the future!
B000I9TWV6,Prentice House "LEE",5,Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in
B000I9TWV6,S. Little,5,She's so enthusiastic and has great adventures!  Our son and daughter both love Dora shows!  They're great enthusiastic fun and the kids learn a little too.
B000IBUIS0,Amazon Customer,3,This season seemed to be more about the artsy predilctions of the actors and producers.  The battle with the Ori became more and more convoluted and was not resolved to my satisfaction with the bad guys getting their butts kicked by the good guys.  I liked the first 9 and would watch them again.  I wouldn't watch season 10 again.
B000IBUIS0,D. Avila "Science Fiction Rules!!",5,If you've never seen the franchise get the movie starring Kurt Russell first.Then get all 10 seasons(there is a boxed set of all 10).Nuff said!!!
B000IBUIS0,I'm here "I'm Here",5,Oh the finale!! Did you get the feels? I did. Man I cried once(on the inside) when I re-watched the most memorable of episodes. Ahh! Why did you have to leave us!!
B000IBUIS0,Koury,5,what an episode. its episodes like this that make me realize that SG-1 isthe best scifi ever. I hope all feel the same!
B000IBUIS0,Paul A Ream Jr,5,Love the characters and seeing them as they develop over time. Very fun show. Episode 200 is awesome. Love it
B000IBUIS0,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),4,While the writers gave us a new enemy in the Ori it also felt a little redundant to do so somewhat since they already were notified that the series would end here. It felt like the writers were hoping that the backers and producers would renew the series for this new saga but after ten years it was time to give the series a decent finale and while you do get the finale it felt a little weak for what the series was.If you already have the other past seasons and for the price of this set I'd say go ahead and add it to your t.v. show collection while not on par with the past eight seasons it still has for the most part an intriguing story and cast to make you watch the season through to the end.
B000IBUIS0,victoria,5,This series is very adventure filled. Not only that but we love the concept of being able to travel to other worlds through a star gate worm hole. How awesome it that! in just seconds you're there. We watched several episodes a night and couldn't wait til the next time we were able to watch. It was fun to see what the team was up to next and what lie ahead on the next planet. You definitely won't be bored with this series.
B000IBUP6A,Kandy Langford,5,Mitchum is always spell binding & he is again.  As a kid "Thunder Road" became part of my psyche (saw at a drive-in).  The song - I will remember to my grave.  Keely Smith as his girl friend couldn't have been more seductive or more in love w/her moonshine runner.  Mitchum always managed to be in trouble no matter which side of the law he was on.  His classic detective films are hard to find - "The Big Sleep" & "Farewell My Lovely".  AGAIN why do most reviewers blab it all?  Paragraphs & paragraphs & paragraphs telling one about a film...ever so boring.  Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands.  I digress...this film is certainly worth watching.  Impossible to notice other actors - Mitchum w/his sleepy eyes & conspicuous laid back attitude could charm the fur off a pussy cat...
B000IBUP6A,Larry Snider,3,Good movie especially if you like Mitchum.
B000ICRKLM,David E. Meadows "Igor",5,Phenomenal set of writers who seem to know how to keep the series action packed and with characters who the audience enjoy watching.  Strongly recommended for the SCI-FI junkies in the world.
B000ICRKLM,D. Avila "Science Fiction Rules!!",5,I love anything Stargate!!!!!  One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad  :o(
B000ICRKLM,E. Helms,5,Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series.
B000ICRKLM,George Beltz,4,At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and didn't want to be disappointed. After watching the first season I was hooked.
B000ICRKLM,gramdon,5,It is so good that i have watched it for a second time.  Just imagine if this were true.  Great cast.
B000ICRKLM,Pamala Pickard,5,I really like Stargate Atlantis.  I like seeing the characters from the first Stargate series working with the current ones.
B000ICRKLM,Paul A Ream Jr,5,I'm a big fan of this series. The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development. No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes.
B000ICRKLM,Ruby Chrisman,5,This is a great sci-fi fiction show for the whole family.  We enjoy watching it.  Very glad the whole show is on prime to view.
B000ICRKLM,Vulcanicus,5,the entire series from the first season through the final fifth season is a marvelous creation of imagination. I love the characters and a course the city with all it's amazing technology listening leo's be under comprehension in some cases shouldn't even be in a position. The monsters better created each week or dangers of the universe springs both in outer space in technology lovers races that they came in contact with. The rating the central 1. I enjoyed the up organic feel the race very similar to the movie series alien having that to organic look to the interiors of the ship and there insect always of preserving food and consuming the life force of human being
B000IJRK7O,B. Burdett,4,Good series  Very happy that William Fitchner joined the crew. He's such a good actor and adds a lot to the show.
B000IJRK7O,Donna L. Piccioli "n2 TINK",5,This is an addictive show. Suspense that leaves you wanting to fast forward to next week so you can find out what is going to happen next.
B000IK882Y,Ed Joines,5,I think Bones is a very good show. I love all the characters and the chemistry between all of them is fun to watch.
B000IK882Y,Galen M. Ozawa "ozworks",5,Better than the first.  Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations.  Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition.  You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much. The writing is still excellent and holds your attention. Looking forward to the new season and more cases.
B000IK882Y,Jodi,5,These are the kind of replays that are always entertaining for the whole family. Enjoyable and good to relax in front of.
B000IK882Y,Lois,5,Again I really Love this show and the people are great the story keeps you wanting for more each week...
B000IK882Y,Lynn Ellingwood "The ESOL Teacher",4,The show is fast paced and a bit thin on story but it is still fun and better than many network shows.  Bones is based on the forensic science unit of the Smithsonian Institution.  The show always has a murder that the show has to solve forensically and the relationship between the workers who seem to work 24/7 adds some spice.  The stories of the Grave Digger and Brennan's father are my favorite.
B000IK882Y,michaelaen_37841,5,Bones are the best series if you like crime and love story then these are the best series for you
B000IK882Y,V Johnson,5,The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season.  The change in other characters helped develop the series.
B000IKP5AM,K. Garrety "kellysb00kz",5,I enjoy British comedies. The language makes me think and stay focused.This comedy has always gotten laughs from me.
B000IKQX44,Carol J. Rader "crdvm",3,While I liked this mini-series enough to but all 5 parts- I was disappointed in the non-ending . Maybe there was supposed to be more story later? Major characters are tossed away. I wouldn't see it again.
B000IKQX44,C. Cameron,3,Typical short series kinda sci-fi. Worth the watch if your looking for something easy to watch and have time to kill.
B000IKQX44,Dan Hangen,4,I remember seeing part of this miniseries.  It is a good one and worth watching.  Interesting plot and concept.  Plus the acting is really good.
B000IKQX44,denmich1997,3,The story was interesting but effects and budget where low by BBC standards.  It was nice that it's all wrapped up in just 6 episodes.
B000IKQX44,John V Evans,3,Invasion Earth is a very slow moving Sci-Fi that you really have to try hard to get through the first few episodes. I would not recommend this series.
B000IKQX44,nythawk,4,I wish it had continued and gave more back story on the bad aliens and the good aliens that sent the Lieutenant from WW2 to warn them. It did prove Einsteins theory of relativity was correct. The show would have made a great television series. I won't give any more spoilers. Happy watching
B000IKQX44,Patois,4,I like scifi.  Looked for series 2 but wasn't available.  I'd like to know what happened to her and her colleague!
B000IKQX44,Peggy H. Rose,4,Am enjoying it but wish that more of the scenes were better lighted.  Hard to see sometimes.  A range of accents makes adds to the interest.
B000IKQX44,Robert W. Murray "igsrule",3,Brit show with several downtown abbey regulars in cast.  Ok for middle of night insomnia.  Fred ward should have been a bigger star.
B000IO3OBK,gregory,5,Wow the season with Ozzie.  Watching him swim and do so many of the challenges was fun.  Definitely one of the good seasons!
B000IO3OBK,Jacob Crampton,5,If you love survivor then you will want to checkout this season. This is one of the better seasons.Love it.
B000IO3OBK,mlsigner "mlsigner",5,This is another great show with scenery that is not to be missed.  The challenges and rewards allowed the contestants to enjoy the native island culture.
B000IO3OBK,nancy,5,Wonderful. Need all seasons available to buy.
B000IXUOP0,C. Carnrike "book keeper",5,Love NCIS - enjoyed Season 4.  Watching every episode of every season to date to have a better understanding of the characters.  This is an awesome show.
B000IXUOP0,Cleo,4,The first two episodes' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas.
B000IXUOP0,D. L. Cheever,5,My wife has become incurably hooked on this show and the eclectic cast of characters. It is entertaining to watch as a result of clever writing and convincingly portrayed characters.  The plots are extremely varied even though they all boil down to the same crime scene investigation theme. There are both ongoing story lines as well as satisfactory resolution of crimes in each episode. The person who dreamed up the character of Abbey deserves a gold star and the role is convincingly as well as entertainingly played.
B000IXUOP0,Kris,5,I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come.
B000IXUOP0,Michelle Polk,5,another great season. My only complaint is how it ended. it was just over. It was like the writers just ran out of steam and left us hanging. The development of the characters in this season has been a great.
B000IXUOP0,movie lover "jean",4,I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition.  Thank You
B000IXUOP0,nelly123,5,Great series and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years  I gave it a five star rating
B000J0Q1KO,Amazon Customer,5,I am one of those people who chooses not to pay for cable so I buy the programs I enjoy and know that will enjoy watch many times.  This series is one of my favorites and I have just about all of the seasons.  I really like William Peterson so I am not sure I will buy any more once he leaves in season 8 or 9.  I find that when I watch them again I see something I missed the times before so it is well worth the money to be able to have control over what I watch and when I watch it.
B000J0Q1KO,cozzetta,5,Excellent!
B000J0Q1KO,D. R. Roberts,5,C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete Seventh Season DvdQuick Delivery! New Condition. Excellent series.HIghly recommend Amazon!!
B000J0Q1KO,Michael Dobey,5,As many people said this show kept getting better each year.The crimes are interesting and the cast is believable and solid.The introduction of the new Character Keppler was a great move although his sudden demise due to a corrupt cop is this seasons one strained aspect. After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he's from Trenton. However that's not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don't make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of "CSI" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it's peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that's true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there's no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of "CSI New York". (which is a great show otherwise).  And that's just another reason to enjoy this wonderful show.
B000J0Q1KO,Michelle Polk,4,THis season is better than the sixth!! More story is given about Grisham and Sarah. The miniture killer was strung all the way through the season. It was great! It seems like the show is going to continue to get better. The ending is left with a cliff hanger and that is the only negative.
B000J0Q1KO,Penny,5,This CSI Season is another great one!  Stories are always interesting and enjoyable. Peterson is one of my favorites. Would highly recommend!
B000J1B1PI,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,4,This season's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season. It may not be the same caliber as the previous ones but it continues to provide entertaining episodes and peek my interest in the characters development (and love interests).
B000J1B1PI,mike  hopkins "mike hopkins",5,Great series and enjoyable to watch.I like how math is used to help solve the different cases.The characters are really down to earth and this series showed life outside the F.B.I.office. Mike
B000J1B1PI,tigerfire2002,5,The storylines in this season are awesome!**SPOILER**My favorite part of this season is Charlie and Amita finally get together officially.
B000J46A6K,Janet Atkinson - Q15J,1,ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom. . .
B000J46A6K,Joan Bachman,5,My favorite characters are Sir Humphrey and the Minister.  Sir Humphrey can twist a simple sentence or command of the Minister in such a way that you cannot remember the question at all.  He is a riot.
B000J46A6K,Tom,3,Off to a slow start in episode one but shows promise. I will continue with that hope and give a more in depth eval.
B000JEZBNI,Ron in Western Maryland,5,I bought this episde of the Outer Limits purely from never forgetting watching it back in the 60's.  It was one of my favorites then and still is.
B000JO9JHW,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,Loved it. I have always wondered what was the hype around this show. Now I know. This show is amazing.
B000JO9JHW,joe,4,If you don't start out liking it keep on watching it gets better. Below are my ratings of each individual season.Season 1: 7/10Season 2: 8/10Season 3: 6/10Season 4: 10/10Season 5: 9/10Season 6: 9/10Season 7: 10/10Season 8 (the final season) is hopefully good.
B000JO9JHW,Mary Louise Pivec,5,Who knew a serial killer could be so charming?
B000JO9JHW,Rich Mahogany,5,One of the best seasons of Dexter besides 4 and 7 in my opinion. With a great villain and awesome story this was a perfect start for everyone's new favorite serial killer.
B000JO9JHW,S. Warren,5,Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily.
B000JQYE4I,Annie Hall,5,Vic and the crew are a good ensemble cast who have so much going on in their lives you wonder how they'll pull it off
B000JQYE4I,Cheryl Carter "cartec",5,I have watched all six seasons and I am about to finish the series.  Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The roller coaster ride is never ending and I am going to miss the series when I finish.  I wish that there was something to take it's place.  Michael Chiklis and the rest of the cast step out of the story and grab you by the shirt and never let go.
B000JQYE4I,Esther Melchor "Cat Lady",5,I loved this show. I had never heard of it until recently and I'm glad I started watching it. Addicting.
B000JQYE4I,Frankie D,5,A great series and this season turned everything upside down. Mackey and his crew are under fire and Forrest Whitaker is out to get them and bring them down. This was was one of the most emotional and shocking seasons ever for this great show. A must buy series if you love cop dramas. This is the best cop show. It is dark and it pulls no punches. Once you watch it you will want to see more. Show will have you hooked.
B000JQYE4I,frugalcrafter,5,Season five sees the strike team under investigation yet again.  You know the writing is good when you want the do anything it takes cops to succeed. While every episode is great there will be some big shockers at the end of the season. I am really glad I have the chance to catch up on this well written if gritty show.
B000JQYE4I,Kim,5,Great show always full of action and on the go. Its not a show for kids and some adults may find it offensive but if you can get past that you wont want to miss the next episodes.
B000JQYE4I,linda21,5,Great show lots of suspense good acting keeps you Awake and goes quick fast pace show to bad it's off the air
B000JQYE4I,Pamela S. Halbig,3,Good show.  You get attached to the character's.  Not what expected in a cop type show.  Watching all the seasons on amazon prime has been great.
B000JQYE4I,R. H. Newmark "BobN",5,If you have watched the previous 4 seasons you wont be disappointed with season 5. The characters are expanded upon and some new ones are introduced to keep things fresh.
B000JQYE4I,Richard Newton,3,They hit a slump here. I also think they really miss Glenn Close. When she joined the show the number of viewers went up 30%. With her gone the show really struggles.
B000JQYE4I,Sewpippy "I love to read both fiction and non...,5,I started at the beginning and am working my way through watching every season - when it first came out I did not think I would like it and now I am hooked - great acting and entertainment!!
B000JQYE4I,Shagnasty,4,Vic continues to walk on thin ice and make it to the other side.  A fond farewell to Lem.  We will miss you in Season 6.
B000JQYE4I,Stormy,5,Another season demonstrating the mix of good and not so good that makes up all people.  Adults only please - not a show for the kiddies or the timorous.
B000JQYE4I,William R. Kolbe,5,Every episode was great!
B000JQYE4I,Wolfar,5,Gritty action and lots of it.I detest crooked cops but these guys made you feel for them.Beware lots of blood....
B000MMX5E4,DebbieT,5,A heartbreaking but realisitic version of the suffering of the Jews and the misconception of what should have been and turned out to be something more horrible. Great photos and exact images made you feel like you were right there in person.
B000MMX5E4,Jaffacree,3,Still horrifying due to its nature but very informational. A watch for history buffs and to never forget one of our darkest tragedys
B000MMX5E4,norma jean kringer,5,I thought I have seen all there is to see about the insane horrors of this place but this series tells a little more about why and how these people went through more than you can imagine and some survived to tell us.  Man cannot rule man.
B000MMX5E4,opirty "opirty",5,If you were not altogether up on the Nazi period or if you were to young to really know about the Nazi's &#34;final solution&#34; this series will certainly bring the horrors of that preriod front & center!!
B000MN4YR0,Micky,1,Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work wasn't that great either.
B000MN4YR0,Woodson J. Savage,1,Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great.  We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest.  Unusual experience at best.
B000MPGI68,BARBARA RICOTTA,5,i started with season 1 friday the 11th of april. just got done with season 8 ..thuday april 18...i gorged myself with it..and fell in love with Keith Sutherland.. i hear he's coming back.. season 9 can hardly wait.
B000MPGI68,C. Sawyer,4,A good story line and good acting.  It's a good thing I don't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode.  I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then.  It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode.  This series is very addictive.
B000MPGI68,Darlene,5,More exciting than any current TV show!  I watch this on my tablet every night...never miss if I can help it.
B000MPGI68,drummer593,5,This dvd set rocks! This whole season is killer! Buy it people you won't regret it period! Plus it came in great shape! I would recommend this series to anybody!
B000MPGI68,Edna M. Dooley "Doolster",5,Every episode has some serious problem that Jack Bauer seems to solve at the risk of his own life (and others also). Love this show.
B000MPGI68,Henrietta Stackpole,3,I'm a huge fan of "24" however I must say that whoever wrote the 2-3 line synopses of the Season 6 epidosdes should ask for his or her money back from whatever institution of higher learning they attended.  The introductory sentences that tell about each new episode on the roster should really give some good information about what's in that segment and it can be done by almost anyone who learned even the basics of writing in grammar school. I can't imagine that Amazon and the people who produce "24" would allow some imbecile to degrade their work even with something as small as this.
B000MPGI68,JKLangstrom,5,Jack Bauer comes to the government's rescue once again! This is another great season of 24 and what is awesome about this season is we finally meet some of the main antagonist that are responsible for many of the tragedies that have occurred in Jack's life! A must see season of 24!!
B000MPGI68,K. Munsey,5,How they even come up with this stuff is beyond me!  This show is great and it is even more awesome that it is included with Amazon Prime!  Thanks Amazon!
B000MPGI68,Martin,3,Season 6 has been eclipsed my more modern series such as Lost. The formulaic plotline is old hat and getting long in the tooth. 24 was a groundbreaker but is okay for my treadmill workouts.
B000MPGI68,Pat,5,We are catching up no 24 so we can watch the new series.  We have become hooked on the drama of this show and are sorry we didn't watch it while it was such a big hit.  it is now a BIG hit for us.
B000MPGI68,Patricia Doherty,5,Nonstop action.  Fascinating PLOTS all interwoven during the course of a day.  Top notch ACTING of fully believable and  intriguing characters.
B000MPGI68,Paul M. Frasca "PMF",5,I am re-watching the last three seasons to refresh myself.  With the new season coming up I can't wait.  Such an awesome show it really is top notch.
B000MPGI68,Steve Lawrence,5,More of Jack Bauer and his over the top method of saving America from terrorists. Very intense at tomes. Enjoy all of it.
B000MPGI68,S. Thiel "Sanpan",5,I loved 24 when it was on tv and now after years I still love it.  All the seasons are the bomb.  LOL
B000MPGI68,St Johns,5,Not sure which season was my favorite.  I truly liked David Palmer as Pres so maybe Season 1and the final season when Chloe took on a commanding role.
B000MPGI68,Wolfgang "Film & TV",2,Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)
B000MVIAUY,Dena Leasure,5,I love this tv show!  My daughter introduced it to me and I couldn't stop watching it.  I've also bought and watched the 3rd Season.  Very good!!
B000MVIAUY,Frankie D,5,A good follow up to the first season. The cliffhanger from season one is answered. You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke. A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story.
B000MVIAUY,Lorri Robinson,5,If you are a fan of the show you want to have this dvd set.  I love the outtakes and extras it makes paying for the set worth it.
B000MVN8GK,Blue Moose,3,This series has for the most part been enjoyable to watch. The process of finding the guilty party holds your interest.
B000MVN8GK,Carol,5,Loved this series.  We were so into watching that we had a hard time stopping.  We watched the total season one episode after another until we finished it.  Great season.
B000MVN8GK,Cat,5,I just enjoyed it..it was always a well written script a good mystery andthe relationships were real. good job!
B000MVN8GK,Cathy,5,We began watching Veronica Mars because it was recommended. Glad we did watch - loved the characters and the fact that they kept showing up. Dick Casablacas was a character who was difficult to like - just shows what a good actor Ryan Hansen is. I hope they keep making more Veronica Mars...
B000MVN8GK,Evie "book weaver",5,Always loved watching this series.  Also watched latest Veronica Mars movie - it was great.
B000MVN8GK,gary blakely,3,nothing really too special ...but it is rather etertaining.....wouldnt buy it but its included in prime so i watch from time to time
B000MVN8GK,Judy Kazlauskis "JudyK",5,The third season was as good as the previous two.  All and all it was a good series from beginning to end.
B000MVN8GK,loveinthemist,4,i enjoyed her in high school a bit better.  Though the show still is enjoyable and i would recommend nice fun show that is not completely dumb as many are today.
B000MVN8GK,Mary Louise Pivec,5,Love the characters; the way it ends was traumatizing.
B000MVN8GK,Mary Spangler,5,I love the Nancy Drew style of this show. A twist to most Private Eyes by having a teenager solving what seems to be real crime on a teenager level. Learning from her private eye dad.. and seemingly real life situations on a college campus.
B000MVN8GK,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like.
B000MVN8GK,mrs natural,5,My husband and I love this show. Too bad it was only 3 seasons.  But I hear there is a movie coming out.
B000MVN8GK,MWOO,5,The shows writers are excellent.  I like the whole cast of characters.  It's funand it has good contemporary stories.
B000MVN8GK,neon,4,I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes. writing is great
B000MVN8GK,nurse_judith,5,This was a cool series 3 - Veronica Mars.  I learned to like the characters after season 1 had ended and that's when this series got good. I gave it 5 stars because the show came together so well.  KRISTEN BELL is charming as a modern day Nancy Drew mistery solver.
B000MVN8GK,Nuttya22,5,I love this show.  Wish there were more seasons.  They left it open ended!  Very excited about the upcoming movie!
B000MVN8GK,oldladywithbcs,5,Loved it. loved it. loved it.  Can't think of anything negative to say about this episode I purchased from Amazon.
B000MVN8GK,P. Alexander "savyshopper",4,I chose 4 stars because this is a really good television show but I am saving the 5 star rating for a knock your socks off show. I really enjoyed it and if I had the option I would give it 4 1/2 start.
B000MVN8GK,Pam Wiedenfeld "Comparison Shopper",5,Loved it from beginning to end.  And the movie was the ending I was looking for.  tough stories lines but told in a light mood.
B000MVN8GK,Paula,5,Veronica Mars is the new Nancy Drew 21st century style. Action packed and lots of fun too.Will wait for more.
B000MVN8GK,Pauline Norton,5,This was one of the best series I've ever watched. Loved Veronica with her kickass attitude. Wish the series had continued with her going into the FBI.
B000MVN8GK,P. Manley "book lover",5,Good show.  Wish there had been more seasons.  It is definitely worth watching if you like detective shows.  Also watch the other two seasons.
B000MVN8GK,Richardao,5,I enjoyed all three seasons of V. Mars.Sad to say: season three was the lastseason but the movie:Veronica Mars opens March 2014.
B000MVN8GK,Roy A Nelson Jr.,5,I wish there was more.  Loved the series.On a side note Amazon's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago.  They need to work on their app for the Roku 3.
B000MVN8GK,Seb311,5,Another great season of a great show. Too bad it didn't last longer. I can't wait for the movie. Free to watch for Prime members.
B000MVN8GK,Tamara J. Christian,5,I loved all 3 seasons of Veronica. This one leaves you a bit hanging. Excited for the movie. Hoping it will wrap everything all up
B000MVN8GK,THOMAS,5,The third season ended after 20 episodes. In Previous years there were 22 episodes.In the last episode (20) of season three there were to many story lines that needed to come  to a conclusion.Does anyone know how the story lines ended up - Election of Sheriff Etc.Looking forward to the movie coming out in 2014.
B000MVN8GK,T. J. Foster,5,I never watched this show when it was broadcast and I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have been able to handle the wait between weeks and seasons. Binge watching this show made it much more enjoyable and I can't wait for the movie because the way the show was cancelled in the middle of a season was a travesty. WATCH IT!
B000MVN8GK,Vicki Butcher,5,Turned in to marshmellow! Love this show. Wish it had lasted more seasons. Hope that with the movies's success they will restart the seasons
B000MVN8HE,A. Gaballa,5,Lots to chew on and enjoy whether you were already familiar with these characters or not.  Nice flow to the plotline.  I enjoyed it very much. The writer made her mother's addictive personality an unavoidable inheritance of Veronica's.  Will our heroine embrace this trait as a weakness that she will always fall prey to or will she find a way to make it a strength? This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars.  All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question: to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life?
B000MVN8HE,charismatic,5,I have missed Veronica Mars so much. It was so sad to see it leave the airwaves after 3 seasons. Seeing this movie was as if it never left.
B000MVN8HE,Doug Henning,5,They did a good job recreating the show.  I am glad to have just got in through Amazon since not sure what a movie screen would have done..  Obviously sets up a possible 2nd movie depending on how much it makes.
B000MVN8HE,Evie "book weaver",5,Always love the series and this movie was great.  Hope there is more coming.  Kristen Bell is wonderful in this series.
B000MVN8HE,Jeannette L Bertsch,4,It was good to see all the characters grown up. Good story line and the movie sealed the TV series. Veronica and Logan end up together. I like happy endings and this did it for me.
B000MVN8HE,Leo R.,5,If you were and still are a fan of this awesome series then the wait is over.  Your fix for more Veronica Mars will be satisfied and having all of the actors reprise their roles give me chills and made be giddy.  The fans spoke and acted by donating to Kickstarter to make this film a reality and to all of them I simply say...THANK YOU!!!I definitely want another movie!!!!
B000MVN8HE,Lisa,3,Not bad.  Slightly campy and geared toward teenagers.  A few good jokes between father and daughter.  I would probably watch another Veronica Mars movie at home but (I wouldn't rush to the theater).  High school reunion scene reminds me of why I do not attend my own.......funny.
B000MVN8HE,Mary Spangler,5,I am a big Veronica Mars fan and this movie with the extended characters from the TV show did not disappoint.
B000MVN8HE,Matein Movies,3,Matein-MovieAn adult Nancy Drew with an attitude and a chip on the shoulder. A Saturday Matinee Movie following or before a Western.
B000MVN8HE,M. HARRIS "MAVDRAC",5,I loved the movie I think they did a really good job of tying up loose ends for those of us who were extremely sad the series ended.
B000MVN8HE,mrs natural,5,We watched the series and was bummed that it didn't continue. We heard they were making a movie and glad that it released on dvd at the same time as the theaters.  The did a great job continuing the story and with a good ending.
B000MVN8HE,Nicole Smith,5,I would watch it again. Funny moments that crack you up.
B000MVN8HE,Nuttya22,5,This movie is awesome!!  Veronica and Logan and their &#34;epic&#34; love story continues!  I wish the show would come back on the air!!  This great movie makes me hopeful for more :)
B000MVN8HE,racergal,5,This is a great movie. I really wish the series would start up again. I LOVE all of these characters. The movie was interesting and kept me interested.
B000MVN8HE,Tamara J. Christian,5,I love this movie. We waited a long time for this to come out. My daughter and I watched it twice. It stayed true to the series and did not disappoint.
B000MVN8HE,Tammie Hurst,5,I loved the series when it was on and have rewatched it many times.  I saw it at the theaters and couldn't wait to own my own copy.  I have already watched it many times and love it.
B000MVN8HE,Uncle B,4,I know this was a true labor of love for everyone involved!! What an effort it must have taken to get so many of the original cast members back for a movie after all of this time. Great show and a GREAT MOVIE!!!
B000N8M43U,Sadcelticlady,5,Many spooky moments ! Good storyline good acting ! James mason is excellent ! I would have bought it had it been available to do so ! Please put it up for sale soon amazon ! If you enjoy old horror you should watch this one !
B000NHRTAO,a reader,2,Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING .... and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free .... don't support these writers ...
B000NHRTAO,D Dawg,5,This is my favorite show.  I find it to be inspirational and moving along with being very funny.  Thank you for allowing me to watch it on your site.
B000NHRTAO,Don Roberto,4,There are good actors and good writing and a concept that does not get much air time- consequences for our actions.
B000NHRTAO,Lovblad,3,Season 1 was simply fantastic. This is slightly a let-down. Probably because the novelty has worn off slightly. As we know Earl is a no-good guy who discovers Karma and decides to undo some wrong things he has done in the past. The persona of Earl is still very sweet and maybe one positive thing is that the episodes are somewhat less aggressive in tone than sometimes in the first season but it is nevertheless not as great.
B000NHRTAO,Pixie,5,I love My Name is Earl and all the kooky characters on this show. I thought I paid a great price for this season 2 of this funny show. I would recommend anyone in the world to get any season of this hilarious comedy show. I love this show! :)
B000NHRTAO,Tim,5,Earl and his crew are great. Love the Karma thing. Each season gets better. Great gift idea. Each show the characters develop farther. Guest stars are great.
B000OC2T4Y,mayzey "d.littin",4,This is not run of the mill comedy. It has sacrasim and wit. I can watch several in a row. That is a major test for any comedy. Half hour increments can seem entertaining. Watching several of the same show in a row is the major test. This one stands up.The actors are superb.
B000OFME82,Janet Atkinson - Q15J,1,not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .
B000OFME82,Jeanie M Nord,1,Don't waste your time with season two.  She could be fun if she wasn't so hateful inside.  Not good.  Yuck.
B000OFME82,N. Dillon "International reader",5,I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. Sarah Silverman is soo darn crazy funny. Season 1 is a must have!
B000OGTRC2,Adele M. Klima,5,Loved it on TV and I love having it here. I just wish the series has continued because there was much more to tell.
B000OGTRC2,Angie,5,The series is action packed and keeps you guessing who is the good and who is the bad guy. I have enjoyed the series a great deal compared to no acting on reality TV and various contests that make up network TV today.
B000OGTRC2,AZ Cactus,4,I like watching Jericho very much and look forward to viewing each new episode. It's all about small town America pulling together in time of disaster with lots of twists and turns. Very entertaining.  The editing of this TV series could be better. Lots of blank time in between where commercials were but not sure how that could be remedied.
B000OGTRC2,beth holman,5,About life after nuclear war. I recommend. It to all adults only.  Amazon you need to buy the rest of the seasons.
B000OGTRC2,Bill D. "Billy D.",5,Fun to watch folks being completely unprepared for disaster.  Hollywood shows they dont understand farmers and country folk very well but the show and premise are still good entertainment.
B000OGTRC2,Britney,5,This show had me at the edge of my seat. It is realistic as to troubles faced during war or disaster. I wasn't sure who was bad and who was good and I enjoyed it from episode one.
B000OGTRC2,C. Badgley,4,i enjoy the blend of tension with everyday life. this is a solid plot background for that kind of mix.just one question: wth happened with Heather?!Emily and Jake just seems so...trope.
B000OGTRC2,Czosnek,5,Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest. Good build of characters. Great story line. Worth the watch.
B000OGTRC2,David A. Bachelder,4,Pretty good series.  There's not that many episodes so don't get too attached.We liked it.  Typical disaster plot.  Enjoy.
B000OGTRC2,Dellamae "dellamae",4,It started out a little slow but the actors and the camera work really pulled this together. After about the fifth episode I was hooked and looked forward to watching the next episode. It was well done except some of the flash backs weren't necessary but all in all I recommend it.
B000OGTRC2,flyfish,4,Give current events this is an interesting story line....Gives you something serious to think about...Survival in an unthinkable situation...However...I think the town is taking the situation way too calmly..but they don't have anyother  choice but to do so.Suitable for teenagers and up I THINK ..
B000OGTRC2,Greg W. Gilstrap "AZ85086",4,A well-developed series that will likely appeal to viewers who like books such as Stephen King's &#34;The Stand&#34; and current television series like &#34;Revolution.&#34;
B000OGTRC2,Jeff's Advice,5,Got my attention from the first episode to the last one in season two.  Very time appropriate for our current time in history.  Just the right amount of drama and action for my taste.  Wish it could go on and on but know all good things must come to an end.
B000OGTRC2,Ken,5,I'm really enjoying this series.  I wish I found it sooner than now.  It's an interesting perspective on what would happen if life changed as we know it.  Will we remain civil or go into anarchy?
B000OGTRC2,Kenneth E Robinson,5,I thought Jericho was a great series. To bad that they seemed to have canceled it in the second season with only 7 episodes.
B000OGTRC2,leo clark "bob",4,first few episodes pretty interesting. but as the season moves forwardthe plots are not as interesting and dont develop as much as they could.
B000OGTRC2,Louis J MaSCITELLO,5,I'm not big on spending a lot of time on fiction.  BUT...The wife LOVES drama.  Add a dystopian view to it and she adores it.  This was right up her alley and she would watch another three seasons had they made them.
B000OGTRC2,lpearson,5,This caught my attention from the first minutes I started watching. I could not wait to see what happens next. I recommend this series. I have watches both seasons and am hoping for a third.
B000OGTRC2,Michael D. Rose,5,I loved Jericho! Suspenseful and held my interest the whole time. The acting was well done and the actors were excellent in their roles. I appreciated that there was no filthy language and sex scenes!!! It held to family values and a theme that is very possibly on the horizon for our country! Good for is to be prepared!!!
B000OGTRC2,MM,5,Love this show. I found I had to keep watching and watching to see what would happen.Looking for the next season soon.
B000OGTRC2,Mom of an ultimate frisbee geek,4,The tv series is enjoyable but not very believable.  Disasters certainly bring out the stupid in people.It was nice to see a show that didn't have zombies.
B000OGTRC2,Neelahofnafia,5,I like futuristic films and was never able to watch this onT.V. as my husband does not and wouldn't watch it. Now I get to watch it on my Kindle.
B000OGTRC2,Nicole McDowell,5,Very realistic.  Really makes you think about what would happen if someone did this kind of thing.  How would America react?
B000OGTRC2,nurse_judith,5,Very well put together drama.  The characters were perfect for the stories being told.  Some of them were new faces who I will look for on other movies and TV shows.  Sometimes the music was too loud and took away from what was happening.  I liked this series.  The end left you to wonder how it all would turn out but it seemed pretty apparent the good ole USA would prevale.
B000OGTRC2,Richee,3,This show has some really corny acting. I only watched a few episodes. I gave it a chance.  But.......gave up.
B000OGTRC2,Roberta Hodges,5,This is a wonderful show. I don't understand why it was cancelled. Anyone that likes survival stories will love this program.
B000OGTRC2,Robert E. Leone "Aim Higher Books",5,A good story line. The characters are believeable. Sad that there were only two seasons on Tv. However seasons three and four are available in comic novel form.
B000OGTRC2,Robert W. Murray "igsrule",5,The first season of Jericho was as  good as any sci fi show.  Suspenseful great cast good story lines.  Shoulda been a classic .
B000OGTRC2,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,AWESOME SHOW........I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE PILOT ....NOW I HAVE & GET THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOW LOT MORE
B000OGTRC2,Ronald F. Paull,4,Generally a good production. Realistic depictions of nuclear weapons and radiation effects. Also pretty realistic depiction of EMP effects (older vehicles without computerized electronic ignitions able to run etc).And then I just like some of the players in whatever role they play.
B000OGTRC2,Ruth in Salt Lake City,4,The show was an interesting concept and took a while to figure out who did the dirty work. The acting was a bit over the top...
B000OGTRC2,R. West,5,Quick Overview: Jake returns to the town of Jericho to work out some money matters with his father. He makes a speedy exit that is halted abruptly when a ginormous explosion rocks Jericho. Now the whole population is cut off from everything.  Secrets and such come out as these citizens ban together to survive.Great plot. Viewers learn a lot about all of the characters and their histories as they maneuver this big scale event. It didn't take me long to get into the swing on things. The cast does a remarkable job working together and delivering believable dialogue.
B000OGTRC2,SomeoneWife,5,This is a good show. I really enjoy it. It keeps you in suspense. I would recommend it to watch.
B000OGTRC2,TheDuke,3,It's an okay show. Acting is about par with being a CBS drama. Story line is great but the story has more potential than the show delivers.
B000OGTRC2,TL in SB,5,Every episode had excitement and suspense and character development.  It has a fascinating storyline that makes you think &#34;what if&#34; and then you see how this town handles not knowing the why and what of the attack on America that they survived.
B000OGTRC2,Value Shopper Pensacola,5,I missed this series when it was on network tv.  It is nice to be able to watch it without commercials.  Thank you for making it available.
B000OJFV3S,Devin Gilson,4,I had forgotten how well acted this entire series was. Watch the entire series from the beginning it will renew your faith in the acting community. This series is far better then most of the movies that are put out today.
B000OJFV3S,Diana Strole,1,I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest.
B000OJFV3S,dragonflylady,5,Love this romantic show. Would recommend this to any women. The men in this show is sexy and you never know what is going to happen in each episode.
B000OJFV3S,E. Best,5,Amazing performances and beautiful settings!  Do not start watching this if you are not prepared to follow to the end.  Highly Addictive!  A little thin on historical accuracy in places but the performances seem to make you forget that.  Watching the performances of the actors in this series will make you want to watch other things they have done.  Highly recommend.
B000OJFV3S,Ebony Reviewer,4,I just finished viewing the first season and i have to admit its a great costume period drama.  It does drag in some places and the acting can be a bit over the top. That being said its a solid B+ mini series.
B000OJFV3S,Frank Schwarz "Specialized Marketer",3,It's a good show that has a LOT of sexual content. I'm just wondering if it's all needed? Other than that it would get another star. And for the record....I'm not a prude. Far from it. I just think the show doesn't need all of the sex scenes.
B000OJFV3S,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth. There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes
B000OJFV3S,Here in ocean city "Melissa",5,Acting is perfect! Love history and almost perfectly accurate with history. I wish the tutors did not end with Henry VIII but continued with Henry's son and then Mary and Elisabeth. After all common?
B000OJFV3S,Hotmess,1,If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's.
B000OJFV3S,Jenny,5,As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times
B000OJFV3S,j,5,I love this series - elegant historically accurate costumes and backgrounds with outstanding performances and a director who tells it like it really was - this is one of the very few  films I will watch again.
B000OJFV3S,J-Squared,4,its better than most shows on tv but that's not saying much. its not very historically accurate from what i can tell but it's interesting to watch
B000OJFV3S,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",4,I am enjoying the Tudors very much. Some acting could be improved but overall the action is exciting. It is entertaining.
B000OJFV3S,Scott Stevenson,4,Great cast.  Surprisingly substantive and high production quality.  Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons.
B000OJFV3S,Skeptical Shopper,5,I didn't know what to expect. But this is hard to stop watching. It's gripping. And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king. Worth watching.
B000OJFV3S,URCME "urcme",5,King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife's and beheading  two of them. And for being  was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive.
B000OJFV3S,Watch Lady,5,Great opening season into history of Henry VIII. First establishing key members of his court. Introduction of different historical players. Not sure hoe close if follows history but interesting.
B000P56MYS,Annie Hall,5,Vic Mackey is one of the most real characters in TV police work.  I'll be sad to see the end of this season and the last one end
B000P56MYS,ChefRon,5,The hardest part about watching these episodes is knowing that this is the next to the last Season in the series.
B000P56MYS,Frankie D,5,A really great show. One of the best cop dramas ever made. Way better than the Sopranoes. All seasons of this show were good. This one was very good. This is a show that always has you wanting more and it comes through. A must buy series!
B000P56MYS,frugalcrafter,5,In this season Vic is trying to be as good as he can and not pull his usual crooked methods. The writing is still very good for an adult show. while my wife does not like the show I am enjoying every episode........when she is gone.
B000P56MYS,Kim,5,Keeps you wanting to see more and more I just finished season 7 was a great series wish there was more.
B000P56MYS,Mark Ackles,5,I gave it this rating because of how this TV series was setup and how it keeps you involved into the series.
B000P56MYS,nurse_judith,5,Season 6 is very intense and full of suspense.  This series has been excellent and season 6 is know exception.  It gets pretty gruesome with murder and mayhem being the norm.  This season is a real love/hate  relationship between all the favorite actors in the series because the plot begins to change and becomes thick with evil doings and secrets found out with revenge being the name of the game.
B000P56MYS,ORURO H.S.,5,I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF CONTINUALLY IS CHIKLIS JUST ABOUT THE BEST ACTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN? HOW IS IT THAT HE CAN IMBUE A TRULY HEARTLESS CRIMINAL WITH JUST ENOUGH HUMAN QUALITIES TO MAKE ONE KEEP HOPING THINGS WILL GET BETTER FOR HIM? ALL THE ACTORS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THE SCRIPT'S TWISTS AND TURNS KEEP THE TENSION BOILING.
B000P56MYS,pam gee,5,wow i loved this series it was jammed pack with action. i can't believe it is over hopefully they will have another great series like it
B000P56MYS,Rockster12,5,I gave this show 5 starts. It keeps you wanting to watch more. I finish watching all 7 seasons in a month. It is addicting.
B000P56MYS,Sewpippy "I love to read both fiction and non...,5,Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest! Have enjoyed watching it all in order!
B000P56MYS,stoneyb,4,Alex character in this show is good.  I didnt like the lanaguage on the show. But did watch season 6. Just a like to much violence for me that is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B000P56MYS,Wilfred J. Milton "&#34;wordsmith&#34;",5,I have submitted comments on previous seasons of 'The Shield' and I continue to recommend this very entertaining and raw TV series!W.J.Milton
B000P56MYS,William R. Kolbe,5,It was a shame to see this series come to an end.
B000S9FEFY,A. House,5,I really enjoyed the series with a mix of detective and personal drama with some humor thrown in for a good mix.
B000S9FEFY,Amazon Customer,5,&#34;NO KA OI&#34; in Hawaiian means &#34;Is the BEST ! ! &#34;Five stars to the writers and the cast.
B000S9FEFY,Amazon Customer,5,I really love the cast of characters and how they interact.  Good actors and interesting stories.  Having humor mixed in is great.
B000S9FEFY,Ann,5,Each season gets better and better while developing the characters and the characters' relationships.  Love the show and still enjoy watching it multiple times.
B000S9FEFY,brenda "open door",5,I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it's last season.  So I am so glad to be able to buy the season's I missed.  I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great.  It's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch.  Before then I was buying dvd's and they were over running my house.
B000S9FEFY,E. Chen,5,Awesome show with great story telling and humor. Really enjoy seeing how each character develops from season to season and conflicts abound in each episode. It is a captivating show.
B000S9FEFY,Elizabeth Vinson,4,Really enjoyed the closer. Watched this from the start to the finish and enjoyed it completely. The things people get away with!!
B000S9FEFY,Julie Fannin,5,One of the best shows ever on tv. It's not the same without Kyra. I bought all 7 seasons! The Closer offers pretty much everything!
B000S9FEFY,Katycaboose "Katty",5,this  series deserved all the accolades for it remains reviting season after season with excellent character developmentand many plot variations so one never tires of viewing.  Kyra never stops being very much female while being an excellent leader with her team.  A very enjoyable series.
B000S9FEFY,L. Grueneberg,5,I have loved this show from the start.  With Prime I am able to go back and review all seasons in case I missed any.  Really sorry there are no new seasons.
B000S9FEFY,Lola,5,Love this show. Love every character. These are seasons that will be great to watch over and over for fans of the show.
B000S9FEFY,Michelle Polk,5,Fabulous!! Another great season. THe only negative would be that there isn't enough episodes!! By the time you are finished watching the last episode you have to wonder how the poor woman survived this season!! Can't wait until next season!
B000S9FEFY,Penny Abernathy,5,I own all 7 seasons of the Closer and watch and re-watch (is that a word?) them all the time.  I bitterly regret that the series only ran for 7 seasons.  The Closer is brilliant.
B000S9FEFY,RND,5,This program illustrates humor in uniform.  The interactions of the actors creates a synergy that just works.  We certainly enjoy this pergram
B000S9FEFY,sewready,4,Fantastic ensamble cast with a wonderful female lead. Stories are character lead which I like. This is a can't miss series
B000S9FEFY,S. Gonzales "PoleCat",5,The Closer Season 3 is 5 stars.  I recently found this show and I'm hooked.. I am however sad the show is over.  I love that fact there is comedy and drama.  Thank you ... Thank You SO much.. lol
B000S9FEFY,S. Lee "waterwoman39",3,Saw the series on tv a few years back and decided we'd forgotten and missed enough episodes to re-watch the series.
B000S9FEFY,susan,4,I have watched 1 and 2 and now working on 3 it is good and i watchen i want a quick cop show fix
B000S9FEFY,Tracy Christensen,5,It is so great to see a headstrong woman following her own personal convictions in order to get the criminal confessions needed to prosecute.  I love the way she comes up with ways around things by finding &#34;loop holes&#34; when promising not to prosecute and then has the FBI prosecute instead thereby keeping helr word.
B000S9FEFY,V Johnson,5,I didn't think the series could get any better but this season was better than the first 2.  So much more of the characters and the stories got even better.
B000S9FEFY,Wellred_2 "Carol",5,I never watched it when it was on TV so I am really enjoying watching all of them now. I really like the main character and how Kyra Sedgwick portrays her.
B000SXKBXU,Araley,1,This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen. Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar...don't waste your time or money!
B000SXKBXU,Eric Barreto "Eric B.",5,I bought this movie simply because I love old Cary Grant movies.  I took a chance and I'm glad that I did. What a great movie this was and it made me seriously consider becoming a foster parent.
B000U6I0B0,Altecian,4,Great show!! If you love science and mayhem on a weekly basis this is the show for you there is also a dose of comedy in it for ya as well.
B000U6I0B0,Daphne,5,It's nice te see a series thats fun to watch some of the things re far fetched but that's the fun parts
B000U6I0B0,DGator,5,One of the best shows on cable. Not only was it funny but in a way educational as well. Too bad SYFY canceled it.
B000U6I0B0,Doc "Doc",5,Eureka is a fun series and this is before everything gets complicated.  Enjoy these early episodes and recognize the hints and subtle plot develop lines.
B000U6I0B0,Jeff SC,4,I like this show because it is entertaining without relying on large amounts of sex and violence. This season builds on the first with an expaninding multiple plot lines.
B000U6I0B0,joan,5,I had never heard of this show until I signed up for Amazon Prime and started watching it on Prime instant video.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  I am really very sad that they have cancelled it.  I could watch it for hours every day and never get tired of it.  It seems like every show I ever find that is an interesting quality show they have to cancel  I'm sure there are a lot more sci-fi fans out there that are upset about this.  Here's wishing they would bring it back!!
B000U6I0B0,Kindle Customer,5,This season is a great follow up to season one.  The show continues to be fun and engaging.  I have been mini marathon viewing 2-3 episodes a day and have not gotten tired of it yet.
B000U6I0B0,Knight68 "EM",4,Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset.  Years ago (probably 58 yrs.) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device.  I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life.  Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship.  Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality.
B000U6I0B0,linda21,4,My husband watches this he likes it. I am not into science fiction so I don't really like it it's fast moving
B000U6I0B0,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,Eureka is the best show on television. I buy each season to have and watch whenever I like. The storylines and the actors are first rate.
B000U6I0B0,old timer,5,I enjoy the fanciful science and the character interactions.  The actors are good and the stories are just plain fun.  They are the kind of shows I like to watch more than once.
B000U6I0B0,Onthepedals,5,We watch Eureka over and over and over.  One of the best shows for us to fall asleep to while watching on the iPad.  Just enough comedy and science to make it funny and not all the heavy drama that most Sy-Fy shows want to include.  Never understood how this show would be cancelled and Warehouse 13 'replaced' it...no comparison.  Oh well..guess that's enough words for now.
B000U6I0B0,pam,5,my husband and I  really have been enjoying this show just found out about it from our grandkids and have had fun watching it
B000U6I0B0,putder53,5,EACH STORY IS GOOD TO WATCH. IT WILL KEEP YOU LAUGHING. AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.
B000U6I0B0,Randall Fox,5,I love this show!  I can't wait to get to the next episode to see what they come up with next.
B000U6I0B0,Robert Bowen,5,Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present.  A must see!! Definitely add to your watch list now.
B000U6I0B0,Stormdemon "Vertrauen Respekt",5,The unique story line continues in season 2.  Jack Carter keep things in perspective by layman standard as usual. A perfect straight man in town full of mad scientists... I loved it.
B000U6YXPM,Amazon Customer,2,I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse.  I would not recommend it.
B000UERE3M,Donna Smith,5,Never get tired of Psych. I want all seasons.
B000UERE3M,mom12,5,this is a fun intro to these two crazy guys.  they are so silly and loveable. the characters are fun and well developed.
B000ULTV4U,DVDwatcher,5,Monk was a very good show. I have enjoyed all of the seasons and this was just as good as the rest. Very well done.
B000ULTV4U,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good.  Quite  worth your hard earned cash.
B000ULTV4U,M. McMann "freelance writer",5,I have been a big fan of Monk since its first season. It just keeps getting better.
B000ULTV4U,mom12,5,I'm a monk-a-holic for sure. I watch episode after episods and I get sad when I'm coming to the end of the season.I prefer Julie to the other assistant.
B000ULTV4U,Taylor J. Huston,5,Season six was another good season for Monk.  The two hour finale had me excited.  Monk is hilarious and Natalie is still keep things together.This is a must-see season!
B000ULZLYY,K. Marlow "Kat",5,I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person.  This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime.
B000ULZLYY,Wolfgang "Film & TV",5,MUST HAVE!Doesn t get better than this.......unfortunately they stopped after 8 years!Maybe the most impressive acting in a long time......
B000UU4IVM,Amazon Customer "Renaissance Man",4,I started watching this series because I saw a reference to it on &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34;.  Now I am hooked.  It's surprisingly thoughtful and well-written.  Watching this on Prime let's me plow through the episodes quickly.  I would highly recommend this series to any Sci-Fi fan.
B000UU4IVM,ChicagoScott1009,5,When I saw the remake of Battlestar Galactica I had the memories of the original show casting heavy doubt on the story being worth the time to watch.  After making it through the first two seasons on Prime Instant Video I can see that I should never judge a show by the quality of a previous one of the same name.  Other than the names being the same in some cases this show carries over nothing from the original and sets itself apart from most shows and takes us to a place far more intriguing than most any do.  I'm not sure what to expect from the remainder of season 3 and 4 but the by the end of 2 and beginning of 3 the story lines that had been set in place went into hyper speed and had more action in 5 episodes than many shows do their entire run.  The writers have no problem pushing the envelope of character development and change as circumstances move so fast it has left my head swimming and my interest peaked as for where they can go from here.  But if the first 2 seasons are any indication then I'll just have to hang on and enjoy the ride hoping the end is not a disappointment after a mind boggling first half.  If you like Science Fiction that pushes the limits of human behavior then you don't want to miss this show.
B000UU4IVM,Christoph Forbes "AlabamaFanLouisianaMan",4,Still enjoy watching although season 2 is a little slower.  It is great to watch without commercials.  A lot different than Battlestar Galactica from the 1980s..
B000UU4IVM,Jdances "bdancer",5,Awesome series so glad to have Amazon Prime so I can see those shows that I didn't have the time to watch.
B000UU4IVM,John M. Delisle,5,I like the characters and the plots are wonderful.  It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen.
B000UU4IVM,Ray "Gray Wolf",5,I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable.  This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment.  A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours.
B000UU4IVM,Sam,5,I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Loren Green years ago but this one is so much better. Good si-fi  and a great cast of characters and story lines to keep the series interesting. I was hooked after season one and looking forward to season three.
B000UU4IVM,Veronica Mitchell,5,I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. I love the characters. Even the music is great. Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship. The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor. Makes my throat hurt listening to him.
B000UU4IX0,Andre Villemaire,4,Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.
B000UU4IX0,Christoph Forbes "AlabamaFanLouisianaMan",4,Great series.  Action packed.  Would like to have seen more of the other crewmember's stories and less of Gayas Baltar and his imaginary girlfriend.
B000UU4IX0,Cicily N. Oakes,5,I don't have a ton to say except I love this series. Period. Watch it from the beginning and you will not regret it.
B000UU4IX0,Derrick Jenkins "love of Gaming/Movies/Anime/...,5,Season Three continues right where season 2 left off at.  With the Cylon occupation in full force and the pressure being on for the colonists of New Caprica and the President Gaius Baltar.  Fans of the show before won't be disappointed with plenty of action between the various characters and the Cylons (them having their issues themselves).The Cylons attempt to make peace with the colonists by starting up a police force made up of colonists of New Caprica.  It just insights the rebels as many view the new police as traitors conspiring with the Cylons.More background of the characters are revealed and the tensions are flaring over Baltar's impending trial for crimes against the colonists that will seperate people and thrust them onto opposing sides with varying views on death being the penalty and others wanting the justice system to actually do what it should do.  If anything Season 3 of BG continues to do what a lot of shows can't...be consisent.
B000UU4IX0,Jack,5,was new & all episodes played with out flaw. fast shipping. great series makes you want to see the next episode. great for science fiction fan.
B000UU4IX0,John M. Delisle,5,This is one of the best written scifi series ever. It is worth watching every episode.  It will be enjoyed by any person who enjoys Star Trek type shows.
B000UU4IX0,Ray "Gray Wolf",5,Very good serial video and has excellent visual and audio.  The continuing story is fascinating and the plots are reasonable and the acting is great.  Hard to downgrade any production of this quality.
B000UUEEIE,B. Burdett,3,This years' series is not as good as previous years. Bought it thinking that it would be.
B000UVUMDO,A Everett,5,The superb acting by Glen Close makes this a great series!  Never get enough of watching the multiple plots and surprises.
B000UVUMDO,Amazon Customer "Nina",5,this is a great series that I wish could go on and on. I watched end of previous season for a refresher before new one started to keep up with all the twists and turns.
B000UVUMDO,Amy S. Hayley,5,What an incredble series!  Very well written.  Never knew what would happen next.  Extremely intense and you will be "hooked" after the 1st episode.  Anxiously awaiting season 2!!
B000UVUMDO,Baroque Music Lover,5,The two things that make for engaging TV watching.  The plot is razor sharp and the players are as good as it gets.  One of the best dramas in recent years.
B000UVUMDO,Blue isle #3,3,I was interested at first because it grabbed me into it....but then soon found out with it starting backwards in story got to be boring. Each character seemed to be defined in detail made me lose interest.  I soon began to know what would most likely happen next per series and then did not care to watch.
B000UVUMDO,DMT,5,Boy was this a great series.  I sincerely hated that it ended.  Glenn Close is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast.
B000UVUMDO,E. Lillian Creveling,1,This is nasty pure trash. Humans should not treat others this way. It is thoroughly not enjoyable. please trash it.
B000UVUMDO,Elizabeth Ansley,5,Crazy scarey characters the plot twists and turns .Evil series with thiroughly despicable people but addictive and I can't stop watching it  but sort of like a mosquito bite you just can't stop scraping
B000UVUMDO,Grandma Buddy,5,I was told by a friend that this was a good series and it is. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good &#34;Who Done It?&#34;  So many twist and turns that you don't see coming.  WARNING:.....it's like a book you can't put down until it's finished.
B000UVUMDO,Jim Hopkins,4,Good acting--well cast.  But some of the Machevilian manipulation was a little too clever by half and that it worked out so flawlessly strained credibility.
B000UVUMDO,Joan Burton,5,You will not regret buying this series.  Glen Close is outstanding.  All of the performances are amazing.  You won't be able to stop watching.  Many twists and turns.  The entire writing staff should get an Emmy.  I hope they get the other seasons in blu ray fast!  Can't wait.
B000UVUMDO,Kindle Customer,5,I can't get enough of this show!  I just finished watching 3 episodes and would be watching a 4th if it weren't almost midnight.  Great acting and suspenseful story.
B000UVUMDO,leo clark "bob",4,just about when you think you have figured out where the plotis headed somebody betrays somebody and it is going in a differentdirecrion.
B000UVUMDO,M1Hop2,5,The cast is great and perfectly cast. I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week.
B000UVUMDO,Matt,5,Great show well done keeps you in suspense throughout.  The quality on the free amazon prime is great don't pay for hd
B000UVUMDO,Patti Wilson "Patti Saint Marie Wilson",4,I loved the first season. My only issue is that I got impatient and wanted to know who did it after the first episode.
B000UVUMDO,Sandy J.,5,Glenn Close and Rose Byrne do a brillant job in this drama series.  It will keep you riveted.  Awesome show!
B000UVUMDO,Scott Solomon,5,This is a great series. I already bought season 2 and 3. I have never been a huge Glenn Close fan but after seeing the first season I have completely changed my mind about her acting. Every second of this show kept my attention. A definite must see...
B000UVUMDO,Timothy J. Gannon,5,I love how cleverly this show moves. The mindless sex is a serious detraction. I can't enjoy this otherwise wonderful show with my 14 year old. I know people have sex... I don't need to watch their version of fulfillment.
B000UVUMDO,Timothy McGivney "Tim",5,I just finished Season 5 and loved how everything came full circle. This show is not to be missed. Patty and Ellen forever!!!
B000UVUMDO,word fanatic,5,Really great first season. Full of twist and unexpected turns. I can't wait to watch season 2! It can only get better!
B000UVUMDO,WTO,2,This show has too much blood and killing!  I don't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times.
B000V5Q8JQ,Donna Smith,5,Vincent D'Onofrio is the best. I miss this show so much. I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show!
B000V5Q8JQ,movie lover "jean",5,I have not been able to view this packet yet but it appears to be new as ordered.thank you very much
B000V5Q8JQ,Wolfgang "Film & TV",5,Criminal Intent is by far the best of all the Law and Order shows on TV ....Season 6 is no exception. Especially the Goran episodes are really good.I can`t wait for them to release season 7
B000V5Q9Y0,B. Burdett,5,Great season as always. Actors are great. Story line is great. What more can be said?
B000V5Q9Y0,CARRIE,5,I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode. They find and catch the perp and prosecute them. I have all the seasons.
B000VU2STU,Amy S. Hayley,5,This show is incredible.  Finally a well-written storyline that hooks you immediately!!  Damian Lewis does a phenominal job. I liked him instantly and have consistently watched as his character grows. Life has excellent script writing.  I really enjoy this show and hope it continues.  Life requires viewers to actually have a brain as it stimulates deep thought!!  WONDERFUL!  Keep it coming!!!!
B000VU2SW2,Sandra Sneed,5,I enjoyed the first episode (pilot) of Chuck when it first aired on NBC. I became a fan and watched it until the show ended. Season one was one of the best seasons and I am glad I own it.
B000VU4GW2,Amazon Customer "castor833",5,The premise is not something I remember being done before now. It  has been brought to life with consumate skill by Damian Lewis and Sarah Sahi as well as Adam Arkin.Watch it and decide for yourself.
B000VU4GW2,Amazon Customer "Grandpa Jack",5,It is a catchy plot line similar to The Finder. I enjoy the mind games Crews comes up with. The plots were good and kept me interested.
B000VU4GW2,Avril Sol,5,Unique show. Can't wait to see how season 1 ends.
B000VU4GW2,B. Lyn,5,A lighthearted detective series with well played characters.  Even though it concerns murders the show is full of lighthearted dialog.and the characters work work together.
B000VU4GW2,Cadima,5,Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend.  Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept.
B000VU4GW2,Cat,3,I like the scripts but am not sure about the lead actor..sometimes I like his acting but I think it would be betterif he was a little more sarcastic. I know he has gottenvery wise in mind and body but with knowledge comes asense of humor and I would love to see him go just a littlebit more into what he is hinting at now...just a little more sarcasticafter all he has earned that no matter how grounded he hasbecome...The scripts are full of it I just wish he would take a littlemore advantage with the delivery..It needs that ZING!!! Forgiving isfine but complacent is just too much to ask..I'm thinking..But that's just me..
B000VU4GW2,Chinabug "chinabug",5,I haven't watched TV in years-got fed up with the high cost-low return from the various cable/satellite companies available.  I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites. Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free.  Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  "Life" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.  I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2(have to love Amazon's price guarantee)and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own.  If you haven't seen Life you haven't lived.
B000VU4GW2,Crafts lover.,5,A story that lets you follow without complications or convoluted stories. Easy to get hooked. a different anti-hero but very entertaining.
B000VU4GW2,Czosnek,5,Loved it on TV but missed some episodes. Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing. Don't know why they didn't keep it going.
B000VU4GW2,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",5,I like how off the wall the show was.  It was very entertaining.  I have shared this show with several friends.
B000VU4GW2,Frank,4,A different kind of a movie. The story unfolds a little more with each episode. I will watch season two.
B000VU4GW2,Frank Schwarz "Specialized Marketer",4,One season is not enough. Great concept of a wrongfully convicted man being released back into his old life. I loved how he used what he learned in prison to better live in the free world. Great cop show.
B000VU4GW2,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,We really enjoyed every minute of this show!!  The acting was great and the story line sure keeps you interested.  We are looking forward to watching Season 2.
B000VU4GW2,Gregg Davis,5,I found this show very interesting...only seen 3 episodes so far but I've enjoyed the storylines. I would recommend it
B000VU4GW2,G. Rhen,5,This program was excellent in both character development and plot.  The interlocking quest of the main character throughout all episodes and the obvious faults of all three chief role players kept one's interest right through to the end of season two and leaves one hoping for more.  Why such a superior show as Life should discontinue production after two seasons while meaningless senselessness goes on season after season after season is an intellectual puzzlement.
B000VU4GW2,James Burns,5,....trust me.  Is it perfect?  No.  But at 19.99 its a steal considering what is being charged for other formulaic cop shows of much lesser value.
B000VU4GW2,Jerome Donarski,3,The lead character is interesting with his enlightened view of life.  The episodes drag a little with not very good writing.
B000VU4GW2,k9krzy,5,Loved  it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2.
B000VU4GW2,Kathleen,5,He was not the best choice for the part I do not think. Not the type to draw a lot of women to the show. It is like the heat of the night . They never figured out that all the women where tuning in to see Bubba not the star. lol My pop came in and said you gals watching Carol O conner and my mom and I both said at the same time No Bubba . and grinned at each other. And we had never said to each other that. lol
B000VU4GW2,Katycaboose "Katty",5,keeps my interest.  Pleased not to see a whole lot of fighting and car chases.  So far not recurring methdology being played out.
B000VU4GW2,L. Grant,5,A little quirky at times.  The lead character is definitely quirky but in a good way.  The homicides can be a little quirky and weird but it makes for an interesting show.  The characters are strong and the actors are good.  Sad to see only 2 seasons to watch and nearly done with Season 2 but I've enjoyed it.
B000VU4GW2,Marrette Chambers "mchambers",4,This appeals to me because of the story inside the stories.  While the main character is working to clear his name he is also working to clear new cases.  And through it all  cannot see that he is being ripped off by his accountant/manager.  This is a 'Do I laugh or cry' show.  Justice is Blind but some people just keep banging their head against the steel door until it one or the other gives way.
B000VU4GW2,Mazie101,5,It started out very new and really different.  It just got better.  Like the &#34;people&#34; and also the &#34;police &#34; work was still brought into the storyline.  Do like to have more of that - and less of the personal &#34;stuff&#34; - not watching a &#34;soap&#34;.  Too bad the show apparently did notstay on long.
B000VU4GW2,michael q,4,Plots for individual episodes are average. Dynamics between the regular characters are high octane entertainment. Recurring theme of season is riveting--- who REALLY killed the people our hero was framed for. And how will they be brought to justice. And how will our hero survive all the conspiracy surrounding him in his quest to make things right?  Stayed tuned  keep watching. I will
B000VU4GW2,M. McCarty "hippy chick",5,I loved this show!  I watched the first season in sequence and then followed it w/ season 2.  This is another fine tv show that falls victim to corporate poor choices in not finding an audience to keep it on the air for more than 2 season.  Highly recommend.
B000VU4GW2,neichan "neichan",5,I was remarkably sorry to only see 2 seasons of this show. I enjoyed watching so much. I made a marathon and viewed both seasons over about 2 days. Fantastic and full of engaging acting. Lots of talent.
B000VU4GW2,Nicholas M. Zallas "Greek Scholar",5,This show was a real &#34;sleeper&#34;.  The main characters were excellent and played off each other very well.  It's to bad the series ended after 2 seasons.
B000VU4GW2,Onthepedals,4,We have watched about half of the episodes via Prime Streaming Video and have enjoyed them. The lead character adds that edginess that adds  dry comedy and drama. We will continue to watch!
B000VU4GW2,pj ellen,5,Love this show. Wish it had continued
B000VU4GW2,P. Maloney "Patrick",3,For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it's first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode.
B000VU4GW2,Robert D. Richter,3,Very average. Not very interesting at times. A lot of eye candy gets thrown in t keep your attention as the plot very slowly unfolds.
B000VU4GW2,steve allison "steve",5,great police show. the show is based on a policemen wrongfully sent to prison. Upon his release he rejoins the department. As he does his daily job he tries to find out who framed him
B000VU4GW2,Sunni,5,The actor in the lead role is convincing in his character. All the episodes are fast paced and keep you wondering what will happen.
B000VU4GW2,Susan C Johnson,5,I loved this story and hope they were able to close up the questions in Season2.  It's a very unique story of police corruption.
B000VU4GW2,Terrijean,5,Truly a finders delight....well done...humorous...realistic...charisma and interaction between characters fascinating. Premise seemed far fetched but well played out in Season 2.
B000VU4GW2,Thomas W. Flacke,5,Simply one of the best most well written TV series. I am not going to go into the allegories it is comedy and suspense with a past and a (you would think) a future. Sadly it was dropped by the networks even though I understand it had very good numbers. In all probability it was dropped by some 30 year old noodle-head the top brass thought had brains. Life: good acting great plot watch the whole two year life of the show.
B000VU4GW2,TL in SB,5,This is one of the best series I've seen.  It's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want.  The premise is different from all the usual cop shows.  The acting is good.  I like the characters.  Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory.
B000VU4GW2,Wayne Midkiff,5,I'm on the second season now and highly enjoy the show. Shame they took it off. Had a lot going for it.
B000VU6K0I,bernie "xyzzy",3,This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV. This is a standard soap opera with a few not to many quasi-sci-fi visions sprinkled in with no logic.Michelle Ryan is cute but there are a lot of cute actresses. I wish her luck in finding a vehicle with redeeming social value and not this mindless rehash of old plots.
B000VU6K0I,Jacqueline A. Conney-forero "jaqtwo",3,I remember the bionic woman from many years ago and I guess it didn't compare to the original but I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed that it was cancelled
B000VU6K0I,serenity83,4,I liked this ones I watched.  I guess I have outgrown this particular type of program.  It was ok but slow
B000VU6K0I,setzco,3,they jumped the story to far from reality eliminate the things that made Bionics and reinvented it as something else and added bizzare plot twist that didn't really make sense.  If you were a big fan of the original this one may disappoint; still special effects are of course better as tech has improved but that's about it.
B000VU8DCQ,Amy S. Johnson "Just Me",5,Chuck is the best show ever!! The nerd gets the superpowers and the girl. What more could you want? Ok Zack Levi is also really cute and has the personality to match. This is one of my favorite shows - the nerd is the hero. What more could you want? Don't miss out on this series!
B000VU8DCQ,Curtis Lyon "curtlyon19",5,such a big fan of the show.  it and the characters actually GREW rather than just got stuck in the non-ending situation syndrome. this final season was a great send-off.  worth every penny to me
B000VU8DCQ,Ed Joines,5,I loved this series. I hated to see all the problems with keeping this series on the air. I will miss this show.
B000VU8DCQ,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,I was really hoping this show would make another season but alas it was not to be.  I am still buying subs and hoping though.Wendy Farrington is the reason this show ran as long as it did.  She came up with the Save Chuck subway campaign.Wendy thank you for your efforts.
B000VU8DCQ,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect shape.  NOTE: SPOILER ALERT!!!!  I was very disppointed that Sara would lose her memory and she and Chuck would bascially have to start their relationship all over again. The writers couldn't have made it a happy ending for the two of them-come on...
B000VU8DCQ,M. Sellers "Angry Saxon",5,Season 5 of Chuck. Wow. I am sad it is over. The production values were high until the end. Still kept the same humor and action mix. I shall miss it.
B000VU8DCQ,R. S. Neilson "Preacher",4,This show started strong and we enjoyed it for several years but not so much in the last two years. The last season was Ok but with the intersect getting into so many people it lost it's appeal. I was also disappointed with the ending.
B000VVEDWO,ReviewersEars,5,Good thing I have a DVR b/c a lot of time was spent rewinding to rewatch the parts I didn't get the first time around.
B000VVEDWO,Shadhawk,5,When I was watching the pilot episode I wasnt sure if I was going to like the show. Then everything fell together at the end of the pilot and I have been hook on the show ever since.  The acting is great and the time jumping gives you the blast from the past feeling.
B000VZUWZW,Annamarie Lubow "Anna",5,At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I'm really enjoying the series.  It's light yet portrays an Aspie really well.
B000VZUWZW,Bookworm936,5,Very funny sitcom about a group of friends who don't fit in with mass culture.  I liked how each character is very similiar yet different from eachother.  Sheldon has been my favorite since the sperm bank when he explains about producing a child who doesn't know if he should use an intergral or differential to find the area between curves.
B000VZUWZW,D. Cox,5,I really enjoyed this show.  It gets 5 stars from me because I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud.  This show has definite potential!  I will definitely watch this one.
B000VZUWZW,Donkey,5,This season movie I thought was great. I love all of The Big Bang Theory shows and watch them over and over whenever I want a great laugh! Sheldon and Penny make the show but they all are really great acting nerds!
B000VZUWZW,Donna L. Piccioli "n2 TINK",5,Wow! Who knew this show would be such a hit? It is a mainstay in out TV line up. Good laughs and fun.
B000VZUWZW,Donna Smith,5,I never get tired of this show. I think it will go down in history with a following like Seinfeld!
B000VZUWZW,drummer593,5,This sitcom is bad ass! Its funny as hell! I will be getting all seasons! Plus it came extra quick and came in excellent condition!
B000VZUWZW,Faye Hollidaye "Faye",5,This show is hilarious! I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo here and there.
B000VZUWZW,flygirltaylor,5,Love the Big Bang Theory!  So handy to have a couple of episodes downloaded on my kindle for when I travel
B000VZUWZW,Howard Roberson,4,Big Bang Theory in My Favorites library now can be streamed any time. Wish I had read the fine print and saw it wasn't HD. But it is a great series.
B000VZUWZW,Jason Nobody,1,PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP! Every other word... ah hahahaha. Unwatchable. Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode.
B000VZUWZW,Leighann,5,This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!
B000VZUWZW,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,We purchased the first season used and it arrived quickly and in great shape and with the correct number and of discs and the correct season one discs included. We just became interested in the show and wanted to catch up by watching previous seasons so we've purchased each season and enjoy watching and rewatching them.
B000VZUWZW,MISTER SJEM "sonofhotpie",2,Where's the humor?  I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me.  I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole.  HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011.
B000VZUWZW,Mom of an ultimate frisbee geek,4,Brilliant show and the writing is very good. (I'm not related to the writers)Somebody must have been a geek in highschool.
B000VZUWZW,S. A. Burke,5,Finally a comedy that provides food for thought! This DVD also has a few extras at the end. Should be a big hit for college grads & faculty.
B000VZUWZW,Terrance L. Mcgowan,5,This show has more laughs than clowns at a circus.  Great adult humor.  Now my wife and I are both hooked.
B000VZUWZW,Tim,5,Great show. Saw it on tv  about half way thru season. Top show. Funny. Something just about everyone likes. Good quality disc.
B000W0H1EG,Chad A. Barts "Chadillac",5,This is the greatest show on television today. I own every season now and watch at least one show every day. It never disappoints in making me laugh historically.
B000W0H1EG,Consumer 45,5,Awesome series! Will continue watching. The cast seem to be fused as one - of course some have relations outside this series so maybe that is why they act so well together. Looking forward to future seasons.
B000W0H1EG, Leah  "Leah",5,This is one of the best shows on TV right now. I love how improv it is and funny.
B000W0H1EG,Lee DeBree,5,Season 3 is a bit better than 2. The story lines aren't as focused on the Danny Devito character (Frank Reynolds). Funny and very enjoyable.
B000W0H1EG,LHoose,4,Gets more and more crazy each season.  I'm watching this with someone else and I'm not always laughing when they are.  It can cause you to be squeamish if you are not into people choosing to do things that are not actually 'by the book'.
B000W0H1EG,N. Dillon "International reader",5,I love &#34;Sunny.&#34; Frank is like the funniest father figure on the planet. I could never have a gloomy day watching these guys. This is a must have!
B000W0HCYK,juan,5,This is a good series.  This is the granddaddy of all police series.  I recommend this series to anybody seeking good entertainment in this type of entertainment.
B000W4BJ7C,Annie M daffodils,5,Prison break continues to be a great "seat of the pants" show...Prison Break Season 3 lives up to the first two seasons.  I highly recommend the entire series.
B000W4BJ7C,B. Burdett,4,This is a series that I hardly ever miss and then can't wait for it to come out on DVD!
B000W4BJ7C,Donna L. Piccioli "n2 TINK",5,The 3rd season brings more thrills and adventures that leave you on the edge of your seat anticipating what will happen next
B000W4BJ7C,Frankie D,3,Overall Prison Break was a very good show. Show title could have been better. This season they are put in a prison in another country and have to break someone out. Not a good season at all. Prison was boring and a lot of the new players were boring. Putting them back in prison was not a good idea. Had a shocking moment and some good points but not a great season weakest of the 4. Buy only if you like the show.
B000W4BJ7C,Justicried,5,Another example of Michaels brain over brawnEven as individuals unravel they stay true to their charactersThe series isn't as believable in this season but it doesn't have to be as the emotional attachment to the characters has already been formedThey keep the series exciting with more implied violence than actual blood and gore which I think is more intelligent
B000W4BJ7C,R Walsh "R .W.",5,YOU FALL IN LOVE AND GET DEEPLY ENGROSSED WITH THE CHARACTERS AND YEARN FOR THEIR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS. VERY ADDICTIVE. CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS SHOW.
B000W4WD40,al,5,i wish that nbc has never taken this show off of the air.  it is one of them shows that you have to see from season 1 and on to under stand the show.  the best.
B000W4WD40,Donna,5,A local station started reruns of Heroes.  I never watch the beginning of the series when it was on TV.  I got hooked on the reruns and decided I needed to watch it from the beginning.  I got Season one and decided I needed Season Two.  I now have 3 & 4.  I will get 5 & 6 at a later date.
B000W4WD40,Frankie D,5,This is the best season of a show that could have been great! Great start and the story was hot. The development of the players was well done. TAfter this season the show went downhill and became trash. A must buy for people who like super heroes and villians. This is the only season oof the show that you should watch or buy.
B000W4WD40,Jessica,5,What if we all had powers but everyone's was different? would you use it for good or evil? Would you help others?
B000W4WD40,Nicole Lewis,5,love being able to watch all these episodes. watching them anytime that I want to. really love watching this show
B000W4WD40,St Johns,5,First couple of seasons were great liked the action stories the most.  I had missed a few episodes so was good to wsatch view them.
B000W4WSCC,linda21,5,Love the show no violence just a real life show with kids playing foitball and a coach  with his family
B000W4WSCC,Nycgirl,5,I'm obsessed with this show. I can't get enough. I watch it until my Kindle runs out of battery and stand watching while it is charging. My hubby just laughs
B000W4WSCC,Sunny,5,I still can't beleive how much I'm going to miss this watching Friday Night Lights......:( 5 seasons was just not enough!
B000W5KBI4,E. Yeager,4,This is a good entertaining show. With the right amount of humor and drama
B000W5KBI4,happy,5,I enjoy this series. The acting is fine. The plots areentertaining. I like the relationship between the father and his son's. And the way the son's work together.
B000W5KBI4,Michael D. Rose,5,I love the acting in all these series. The stories are exciting and the plots are good. They are family friendly and there is no vulgarity; which is rare these days! You will enjoy NUMBERS!
B000W5KBI4,mike  hopkins "mike hopkins",5,You will enjoy this show if you like police and(or)math stories.This show combines a math teacher working with the FBI to solve crimes.
B000W5KBI4,M. McMann "freelance writer",5,Numb3rs is a great television show due to its excellent writing and perfect casting. Rob Morrow has been lucky enough to get his second hit series. Who knew that math could be so fascinating!!!
B000W5KBI4,tigerfire2002,5,Watching Colby having to get back with the team and learning more about everyone's backgrounds are some great plus' in this season. Also great to see Charlie and Amita getting closer
B000W5NSNE,Betty J. Conner,5,These are great.  We have now watched seasons 1 through 10 and are now anxiously awaiting the 11th  season. We love NCIS.
B000W5NSNE,C. Carnrike "book keeper",5,Loved Season 5 - every episode with great acting and the characters' story lines interwoven.  Some great writing and awesome cast.
B000W5NSNE,Christopher Rech,5,My family really enjoyed watching NCIS the Complete Fifth Season! There aren't many shows left that we can watch as a family but this is one of them! Thanks for a great sale!
B000W5NSNE,glacierbear,5,I really like all of the NCIS episodes and enjoy the interactions of the cast. I've purchased all of the series up to and including season 10. In April when 11 is over i will purchase those as well. My wife is currently watching all of the seasons and is having a good time and laughing a lot.
B000W5NSNE,nelly123,5,Great series and I would recommend to anyone over 18 years the storylines and interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000W5NSNE,Rotatiller,5,The product was in excellent condition and I got it very quickly. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B000W5PIYQ,brittany manuel,4,Just more of the same. The show needs to be more realistic. And they should have more interaction with the local cops and with FBI. Some episodes are fairly entertaining but I would not buy the entire season.
B000W5PIYQ,Jenny,5,I would buy this in a new york min.as always well acted plot was on the edge and left you wanting more
B000W5PIYQ,LHoose,5,Great show and gets better as it goes.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Must watch from the beginning. Amazing!
B000W5PIYQ,Michelle Polk,4,A good season but seems like it is losing its umph. I am hoping with the new characters coming up in the 9th season it will get back all of its fire.Each episode was standard fare with little question the crime scene investigators would get their culprit. The last episode is a bit suprising so be ready.
B000W5R3QC,BHoward,4,We knew the outcome of this one and it was still good.  It was a different take on the island Survivors.
B000W5R3QC,Jacob Crampton,5,I love this show. China was'nt one of my favorite seasons but it was good all the same. I bought it well worth ten bucks.
B000W5R3QC,JB,5,I love Survivor and Season 15 is definitely in my top 5 or 6. I highly recommend watching. There are a few really fun characters.
B000WDS04I,Adam Richards "that dude",5,Speedy deliver. DVD received as advertised. Opened the package; put in the DVD; just push play... It another terrific season of HIMYM
B000WDS04I,Aimee,5,This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
B000WFB83Q,Cheryl,5,I enjoy the unit.  Great looking guys that are not afraid to get dirty.  The loyalty is very refreshing especially now days. What is not to like?
B000WFB83Q,DS "Say something about yourself!",5,I don't know why this was cancelled prematurely but I really liked this show and wish there were many more seasons to watch.
B000WFB83Q,Frankie D,4,This season was cool. Not better than the first 2 seasons. Kind of slowed down. Still worth getting though. Better than season 4
B000WFB83Q,Frederic torres,4,The characters and the stories are all over the places.Does not feel like season 1.Good suspense though.The characters and the stories are all over the places.Does not feel like season 1.Good suspense though.
B000WFB83Q,gary seamon,5,What a great series this was.  need to get more series like this one.  I wish it was still on television.
B000WFB83Q,kbertch,5,I watched the show The Unit when it was television and then bought my husband the first two seasons on DVD.  I didn't know that it had continued until I watched it on Amazon Fire streaming video.  I liked it so much that my husband and I went back to the beginning of the series after we watched seasons 3 and 4.  Watch it and find out for yourself how good it is.
B000WFB83Q,mipiacedeltutto,5,I love this show I thought the beginning of season three was the best of the series. They definitely took a different approach for this season then season 2 but it works and is a fun show to watch. I always get a kick out of how many foreign countries look like a washed out version of California. :)
B000WFB83Q,Mootsie,5,This series keeps you pumped up! It's like you're there with them on their missions. Love this series! Keep it coming!
B000WFB83Q,Neelahofnafia,5,I love this series!  Stories are interesting and are concluded with each episode and not carried over to next time. I love Dennis Haysbert as Jonas. His voice is incledible and what a tall man. Sorry it is no longer being made.
B000WFB83Q,O. Mallard,5,I love all the seasons of The Unit. Wish it was still on television. I enjoyed my binge watch of this show. One exciting episode after another.
B000WFB83Q,RJK,5,The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B000WFFAIA,David Lehmann,5,Like the series and the actors. Please see our other reviews of Bones. Range of personalities and dynamics are good.
B000WFFAIA,Entertainment Aficionado,3,This is the most socking and disappointing of the Bones seasons. The short duration because of the writers strike (don&#8217;t they realize the effects of their strike ripple through the years to create animosity?). This caused some short cuts in the plot points of the season. One of the episodes from Season 2 appears in season 3 and it feels horribly out of place. The finally was very well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat!
B000WFFAIA,michaelaen_37841,5,The bones series are one of the best if you like crime and love then these are the series for you
B000WFFAIA,Michael Dobey,4,This is a great tv series with well developed characters andbevy of interesting stories.  I have watched each season on dvd andseason 3 is as good as the first two.  Even if it's a shorter one due to the writers strikes.  One of the main reasons to watch this show is theromantic tension between the two lead characters. The show reminds me of C.S.I but it really delves into the personal lives of the characters.  It would be great to see more of this with the Booth and Cam characters aswell. There isn't a bad episode in this season either.  I can't understand the low ratings that some people gave for such a well made and entertaining show. And you don't need to start at season 1 to enjoy season 3 at all.  So if you are into a great  crime procedural show with great characters and fine acting then this one is for you.
B000WFFAIA,Michelle Polk,4,Another great season but a bit choppy. For some reason there were a couple of episodes mixed up or somthing. At the beginning Angela and Hodges were engaged but then in the middle of the season there is a couple of episodes where Hodges is trying to ask her to marry him.It was a bit confusing. THere is a episode about horses and humans running around pretending to be horses.It was rather disgusting. The best part about that episode is the last five minutes when the two main characters are discussing the days work.
B000WFFAIA,V Johnson,5,The series kept getting better and better.  The interaction between Bones and Booth started to really progress.  The cases took on some weird overtones.
B000WFN3XY,James F. MacLean,5,Too bad it only ran for one season. Jeff was in top form. He showed emotions that I thought were beyond his acting ability. The story's were top notch.
B000WFN3XY,Timothy J. Gannon,4,Having voices in one's head to assist with one's work is not crazy. That detective R gets a visual is a bonus. Really fun to watch each case unfold.
B000WHIIO6,CHR,5,It is terrible that it was so short of a run. It never lost that special thing that kept me watching.
B000WHIIO6,Lynn,5,Now this is a very exciting and sexy show! I would advise taking all your heart medications before you watch. You will definitely need to cool down after and episode of this!
B000WHIIO6,stoneyb,5,this show was excellent to watch.  Alex made a very sexy vampire.  WOW  I liked the shows and the action scene.  Excellent writing too.  Should have lsted longer.
B000WHIIO6,yongbing1,5,I love this little human and vampire romance. There is absolutely great chemistry between Alex and Sophia. They make it all plausible.Now there are quite a few vampire shows around. Moonlight was just ahead of the times.
B000WM9ZU2,David E. Meadows "Igor",5,Have finished Season 4 for the series. Am still enjoying the Sci-Fi thriller and have started the fifth season.  What a great way to catch on your missed series from being stationed overseas during the majority of the period.  Strongly recommended.  The key to good SciFi is identifying new technology fiction that meets the challenges of known theories that have a great opportunity for sometime in the future of coming true.
B000WM9ZU2,DebB,5,As good as SG-1. One of my all-time favorite sci-fi shows. I only wish they would make more like this!
B000WM9ZU2,E. Helms,5,Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. Hate that it was canceled so soon.
B000WM9ZU2,frugalcrafter,4,I enjoyed this science fiction season because of the well written characters and stories.  You see some changes around Atlantis in the city and the situation they are in.
B000WM9ZU2,Jacqueline Garrett "jackie g",5,one of my favorite shows.  it miss it very much and look forward to a movie (that's what they promised)
B000WM9ZU2, Leah  "Leah",3,Im sorry I LOVE u SGA but this last season was not up to the high level that was set. The best ep was a direct ripoff of momento!
B000WM9ZU2,L. Grant,5,I'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out.  The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons.  I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end.  This one has a different spin but a similar show (same creators).  I've enjoyed this one as well.
B000WM9ZU2,Paul A Ream Jr,5,I love this show. Quite a bit more than ag-1. The characters are just quite interesting.I have to add words
B000WM9ZU2,Robert C. Wieland "MUSIC LOVER",4,Not quite as good as the original but then again they didn't have RDA as their lead. But on the whole it was a good sequel
B000WM9ZU2,Ruby Chrisman,5,Great family show. We really enjoy it. Science fiction is a family favorite. The characters are easy to relate to.
B000WM9ZU2,Trunkneck,5,Atlantis is a fast sexy sci-fi made for TV that exceeds all expectations. I would highly recommend to anyone into sci-fi or action adventure.
B000WMGZ8M,D Dawg,5,This is one of my favorite shows. I personally find it to to be inspirational. I have seen all of the episodes and wish they would bring it back the cliff hanger at the end of season 4 waa intense
B000WMGZ8M,Don Roberto,5,I like it because the characters make me feel boring but normal.  Too bad it is gone.  Good thing they have the videos on line.
B000WMGZ8M,M. McMann "freelance writer",5,I really enjoy this series. The cast is outstanding. Joy is the funniest gorgeous woman I have ever seen.
B000WMGZ8M,Tim,5,Funny got better as seasons went on.  Whish it was still on.  Like to see re make with same people jus tdon't wait to long.
B000WT7R6O,Aislinn,4,This is a good season. Dean has contracted to go to Hell and they're try to find a way to keep him out. Only thing I don't like is that the shows don't play the lead-in without you having to go some work to get to see it. I enjoy the lead-ins to each episode. As far as I know this is the only season that doesn't automatically play them. Still a great show and well worth watching.
B000WT7R6O,Frankie D,5,The third season has Sam and Dean trying to save Dean soul from hell. They have killed the yellow eyed demon and are now trying to save Dean from going to hell because he made a deal with a demon to save Sam. As we have learned from this series that this family keeps makking deals with demons and pay the price. It cost them there father life. Season was very good. They hunt down demons and other stuff. Gets slow in the middle but the ending is very well done! A jaw dropping ending that will leave you speechless. They also have that actress who plays Maggie from the Walking Dead in it when she was younger. She was ok.
B000WT7R6O,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,Love the DVD set and beautiful packaging.  I love this series and have bought the entire series available.  Received set when promised.
B000WT7R6O,J. L. Garrell "JL Garrell",5,This show just keeps getting better and better. All of the mythology and the season long plots are super fun to watch. And the show just keeps getting funnier without losing it's badass-dom. I love it!
B000WT7R6O,Lorri Robinson,5,I like the arc that this series has taken.  The shortened season is a bit disappointing.  However even because of it the storyline of season 3 works.
B000WT7R6O,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,If you haven't watched any of the Supernatural shows you are missing out on a great show! This show rocks! I really hope they don't end the show after 5 seasons like the creator keeps saying he's going to do. You can keep supernatural stuff going forever! I get the magazine which I highly recommend too. You learn a lot of stuff about the actors and what's going on with the show in the book. Also has some hot posters too. The music for the show is always awesome! I wish they could get a soundtrack out if they haven't already. I know there were some problems with that in reading the magazine. We can only hope. Once again..I highly recommend this show..you will not be disappointed!
B000WT7R6O,Rene',5,This season was wonderful.  Really great characters and plots.
B000WT7R6O,Tara "Tara",5,I find this seasons very entertaining and the interactions between Sam and Dean refreshing.  This is one of my favorite series that I never get tired of.
B000WUAZZI,Mark C. Meyers "Doc Savage collector",5,enjoyable series with Michael Gross and a cast of cool new characters. Short lived with only about 12 episodes.Relive the Grabbers.
B000Y0S72O,jared,5,One of the best SciFi shows out there. I Can't stop watching this show. If you enjoy good stuff you'll enoy this.
B000Y0S72O,Koury,5,Yea. This was the best SG-1 I've ever seen. The only thing that would have put it over the topis if it was a tw part that had more time to develop the last 15 minutes of the show.
B000ZU1KMW,David Fouse,5,It is BSG. Do I need to say more? Season 4 is full of good writing and acting along with some fantastic special effect scenes.
B000ZU1KMW,Jdances "bdancer",5,One of the best syfy series I've seen. So good I rewatched Caprica series.  Please bring it back. So much more to see.
B000ZU1KMW,Jeff SC,4,I enjoyed all 4 seasons of BSG. I think this season finished off the series in a way that wrapped up most of the story lines just right
B000ZU1KMW,joe shlobotnik "Mountaineer Fan",5,I've watched this series from beginning to end about a dozen times now.  It seems that I never tire of watching it.
B000ZU1KMW,John M. Delisle,5,This is the fourth year and it was as well written and filmed as the other three.  The characters are fantastic.  I think Edward Olmos has done a wonderful job in this series.  I liked this series better than the original with Lorne Greene.
B000ZU1KMW,Stella Shahan "sastar27",5,I love the battlestar galactica seasons and this seasons was more spectacular than the last.  Full of action and storylines
B0011NHCYM,Amy S. Johnson "Just Me",5,This show is fast paced and fun. I love the "helping the little guy" angle and the quick humor in every episode.
B0011NHCYM,Anon "Anon",5,Great for background noise. keeps you interested and entertained yet you do not have to sit and watch the whole thing.
B0011NHCYM,Jen Sites,5,I have been a fan since the first episode. Jeffrey Donovan is a awesome actor . Plus we always looks hot in his suites. I also really like the actor that plays Sam. He is so funny and cute also. If you like action packed shows you gotta see burn notice. There's never a dull moment.
B0011NHCYM,K. Anderson "andersox",5,Jeffrey Donovan has played some really smarmy jerks in some of his previous roles.  It was tough for me to want to watch "Burn Notice."  Glad I did.  I really like the show's concept and chemistry of the cast.
B0012F6C72,Ron Baker,4,Impressive cast and a mystery to solve in the enclave of the very rich and devious. This film has a running concept that compare's a primitive tribe and their brutal rituals with the behavior of the very rich. This works very well. Great Prime choice. Recommended.
B0012H0DBG,Cestmoi,1,It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it's not funny. It's like a cheap soft porn. The dialogues are over the top.
B0012H0DBG,cindyszy,3,The story lines are not too bad and the characters are fairly interesting.  It is what would be called soft porn so that's a bit of an alert for those not quite into that kind of thing.  I find a lot of the people sad and living unfulfilled lives.  Maybe that's why they want to full them with lots of sex.  I do find that it keeps me watching to find out what is going to happen next with certain characters.
B0012H0DBG,Crashconklin,5,it's got a lote going 4 it. cursing very tasteless humor. it's a more human swing of parts 4 dave compared to moulder . puss the most important to me NAKED LADIES and a few big named stares. only thing missing is graphic violence
B0012H0DBG,Daniel Lalor,5,If there was ever a sequel to catcher in the rye... this would be it. The humor is witty and sharp plot twists abound and there are many belly laughs thrown in. Binge watch it!
B0012H0DBG,Melesio Gonzalez,4,I enjoyed the unlikely antics of the main character.  There really isn't much else I can say other than it's entertaining.
B0012H0DBG,nurse_judith,4,This is certainly a funny show.  The antics of our main character is sometimes outrageous and somewhat a naughty boy.  I like all the regular actors on the show and they all seem well suited for their parts.  I guess it's only fair to let you know there is plenty of sex and cuss words.  If you enjoy a show as I've described than you will enjoy this series.
B0012H0DBG,Rich,2,To much nudity and sex with a kid involved. Story lines are weak at best. You know he's going to lay the girl as soon as they meet no surprise there. The girls are pretty and built but a woman wouldn't really let her daughter be subjected to such a life. If you want T and A and lots of it watch the series. Other wise there are much better series to watch.
B0012H0DBG,woody,2,not good for your children to watch too much sex and bad words and bad plot it has no learning of any good habits
B0012QRPU4,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,this series is fantastic Bryan Cranston freaking rules this series. Its wild entertaining i must watch for any tv series watcher out there this series delivers the goods never letting down.
B0012QRPU4,Bonita Blackwell,5,Breaking hilarious!  This is one occasion where all the hype is true.  Endearing characters you want to love and hate at the same time.  Situational comedy with a twist.
B0012QRPU4,BrotherSpider "Spider",5,at least for me it isn'ti was sorry that season one was cut short by the writers. THIS is what TV should be like. i loved it and am a devoted fan now.Can't wait for season three on Blu Ray
B0012QRPU4,Dave PA,5,The first episode will confuse and make you question just what is going on. It is a little slow at times but there is a lot of set up for the second season which is just unreal. It's a dark show but it is awesome.
B0012QRPU4,Jerry D. Mills,4,Enjoy it so far but I've not yet finished the series.  Anxious for the next seson season good or bad
B0012QRPU4,John T Robinson,2,I never got into this series. I wasn't sure if this was a parody or a drama so I gave up on it.
B0012QRPU4,Koury,5,Now many of you may be thinking the same thing and I don'tblame you at all. The mere mention of the fact has long helda power seldom used for anything. Again thanks.
B0012QRPU4,Looking for a Blockbuster,5,Best show on Tv.  You never know what might happen on this show. There's always a good twist on every episode.
B0012QRPU4,Lynn Ellingwood "The ESOL Teacher",5,Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching doesn't seem to be one of them.  Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer.  He wavers on treatment but doesn't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone.  It's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth.  He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it.
B0012QRPU4,Mix-in-it,5,Wish I started watching it back when it was new but never too late. Thinking about buying the 2nd season.
B0012QRPU4,Nancy Tice,5,Just finished season one and started season two. Was convinced to try watching by my daughter. She was right it is addictive! ( no pun intended)
B0012QRPU4,Rachelle S.,5,My son loves this season and I bought this season for him so he can enjoy it again.  I rated it 5 stars
B0012QRPU4,Rich Mahogany,5,Amazing start to the greatest tv show that has yet to come out. No show has ever induced so much binge watching out of me watched the first 4 seasons on netflix over the course of a few days
B0012QRPU4,Rosie Palms,5,This show is awesome.  i got rid of cable last year (one of the best ideas i've had) but i miss shows like this.  i had no idea breaking bad was this good.  a must watch if you're like me and don't have time to watch much.
B0013FJOG2,Angie,5,It was a surprise ending and I was let down only in that it was the end of the show. Many of my favorite characters were killed but good prevailed in the end. Wish more series like this were on TV instead of the competitions and reality junk. I love a good story and good acting.
B0013FJOG2,AZ Cactus,4,I still have 2 episodes to watch of season 2 but have enjoyed viewing all of season 1 and the partial of season 2. Nuclear disaster hits and a small town American misses the disaster and trying to survive with everyday drama and personalities added in. Boiling down to survival of the fittest.
B0013FJOG2,beth holman,5,About life after nuclear war.  Amazon needs to get rest of series doesn't have it all.  I highly recommend. It.
B0013FJOG2,CT Crawford,3,Haven't watched enough episodes to conclude but what I've seen doesn't have me sitting on the edge of my seat or having me cheering for the characters yet.  It's sad to think this is a possibility for humanity.
B0013FJOG2,Ken,5,an interesting plot line.  How everyone reacts is interesting and makes you think what you would do in a massive disaster.Hope nothing like this happens but it makes you think.
B0013FJOG2,Kenneth E Robinson,4,I would have given it an excellent rating if not for the fact that the show was obviously cut short. To bad I did enjoy it.
B0013FJOG2,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",4,Writing is beginning to get worse.  When the writers run out of what to write they turn to sex and violence. The story was much involved in the survival and now it is turning into a lot of batteling and some romance.  It should stay with the origional direction set when the series started.  Writers are making a mistake.
B0013FJOG2,Lynn Ellingwood "The ESOL Teacher",5,A fitting end to an exciting show.  The second season is only 6 episodes long but very worthy to watch.  There is an ending to the show though it leaves an opening for something more.  Very nicely done.  I wish there could have been more.
B0013FJOG2,maurice cortez,5,Watch it and see how America overcome comes domestic terrorism and once again victorious. True Americans are some of the toughest with courage and strength that shows through in this film.
B0013FJOG2,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,AWESOME SHOW!!!!!! I DID NOT WATCH IT WHEN IT WAS ON TV(BAD TIMING) IT KEEPS U HANGING ON WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN!!!  WITH NO ADVERTIZING U GET THE WHOLE SHOW...NO LAG...TO BAD IT WAS CANCELED
B0013FJOG2,shane molitor,4,doesn't quite follow the more realistic aspect of this kind of event but still a very good show. recommend watching.
B0013FJOG2,Taketoshi Takahashi "takahashh007",5,Great show. It is also a difficult TV show to quit and do something else that I have to do. It is worth spending time to watch the entire episodes.
B0013FJOG2,TheDuke,3,It's a decent season but they just kinda flopped on the end. Decent show but dialog and writing is marginal at best.
B0013FJOG2,thepoetnmotion,4,An entertaining show to watch. The series moves at a pretty fast pace and I haven't run in to any slow segments in the series.
B0013FJOG2,TL in SB,5,This show is an example of how good TV can be.  The situations and characters were all interesting.  Each episode had lots of tension.  You never knew what was coming next.  I recommend this show for anyone.
B0013FJOG2,valeri,5,The best and the worst of human behavior is brought to life in this series as a small town copes with the aftermath of a nuclear war. The adorable Skeet Ulrich leads a stellar ensemble cast in this compelling drama. I wish the show had lasted a few more seasons. A contemporary and relevant show...
B0013FLHEE,John Egbert "jegbert",3,This season is a fan favorite but I didn't care for it as much. Probably because the males were SO dumb that it was painful to watch them flounder through the game.
B0013FLHEE,mlsigner "mlsigner",5,There are several island shows in a row and this one showed the vast number of islands surrounding the location and volcanos.  I always like the shows and enjoy watching over and over.
B0013Z0PLA,David "Black Widow 2014",5,The only reason for watching this movie or owning it is because of robert englund. and jenna jameson. This movie was actually pretty good. robert englund is awesome. and jenna jameson is totally hot. if love these two actors then you'll love this movie
B0013Z0PLA,Michael Kerjman,3,Lap-dancers are turned into zombies with mortal consequences for attending the illegal venue: the more blood-the more males like it!This film is not my cap of tea surely.
B00150OTCE,Cestmoi,3,This movie has a good plot. The ending is touching. It shows how great a mother's love for her child is. It moves at very slow pace. It has only a couple of suspenseful moments. The special effects is below par compared to those of Hollywood. This is also one of the reason  that makes the movie not so supenseful. It's worth watching once.
B00150OTCE,chikiBABY,5,It's a good movie. A different ghost story. Also a good movie the "Devil's Backbone".
B00150OTCE, Leah  "Leah",3,This is a good movie. Nice and scary. But be prepared to do some reading as it is in spanish.
B00150OTCE,millerj,2,There should have been some indication that the movie is in Spanish. ..very hard to follow. Hate subtitles. It's tough trying to read and watch a movie at the same time. Didn't like it at all.
B0015TFUSC,Linda S "readinglife",2,Mindless show.  Truly wasting your time.  Not funny and nothing to learn from.  Don't let your kids watch this show.
B0015TFUSC,Not Julia Child,5,We like this show.  It is good and funny sometimes and serious and dramatic all at once.  Lots of killing but not terribly gruesome.
B0015TFUSC,Wife Mother Moon Child "&#34;Grandma&#34;",4,This is a series that makes you glad that you don't have friends like this.  If these are the average citizens of today we are all in trouble if they vote. . .
B0015ZS0GA,nancy,5,Wonderful. Loved it.
B0015ZS0GA,Vonnie "Vonnie",5,This was my first Top Chef DVD set. I didn't see it on cable. I was very impressed. I loved it. I have bought other seasons. I will be glad when all of the seasons are on DVD. I look forward to ordering them
B0018SOVIA,Amazon Customer,5,The grans loved it.  It kept a four and five year old happy.  Nothing better in the entire world to me.  Family friendly.
B0018SOVIA,Amy Thompson,5,My two year old is self identifying letters! Wherever we go she is pointing out at least 6-8 letters and is consistently correct.
B0018SOVIA,Gigi123,4,My son had delay speech but after watching these shows on sprout and on amazon he started to say more words and able to recognize what the words say and mean.The songs are catchy ... yet saying the ABCs they go a bit fast for my 23 month old & I just don't understand why they have Little Red Riding Hood looking like a hooker in her outfit...but all in all. its a fun - word builing/learning show.
B0018SOVIA,Stephen C. Rankin,5,my 18 mont old recites much of the alphabet and cheers. His fav dvd. Highest recommendation possible. The concept is awesome.
B0018SOVIA,Tabitha,5,my daughter loves this. she will sit and watch this and interacts with all the things that they ask you to do
B001ALX4I8,C. Latham "zcarbo",5,In Plain Sight: Season OneLow price.  Arrived quickly and just as described.
B001ALX4I8,Jen Sites,5,I remembered when this show started . I've loved it from the beginning . I finally decided to collect the whole series.  It's a good show.  But it's not one the whole family can watch.
B001ALX4I8,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",5,Mary is Juno grown up.  Sympathy wrapped in practicality.  Her family is dysfunctionsl and she has to somehow perform her incredibly difficult and time consuming job and save her sister and mother from themselves.  Her lover is hot.  Christian was previously one of the more successful Dancers with the stars.
B001ALX4I8,Nedra Ann Schott,5,See my review of the third season.  I got hooked on the first season but still felt the same after the third season.
B001ALX4I8,Platinu,4,I had never seen an episode of this but the advertisements intrigued me.  I felt I had to try this series out and I'm glad I did.  I'm very fond of character-driven shows/movies and this one is very well done.  I'm enjoying it tremendously.
B001ALX4I8,sewready,4,I liked this show and was sad to see it leave the air. but now I'm watching it all over again. Mary is quite the cynic to start it is amazing to watch her grow over the seasons.
B001ATJQB4,Daniel Lalor,4,This tribute to the great cartoons of my youth... Johnny Quest... Speed Racer etc.. is done extremely well. The animation is done in a throwback style. The writing is fast and witty.  There are constant references to those classic cartoon shows. Somehow though the show is watchable in its own right. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments as well as head shaking &#34; I cant believe they made THAT joke&#34; moments.  Watch this show...

B001ATJQB4,Kid Kyoto,5,After 3 seasons you might worry the the Venture Bros' parody of 70s and 80s cartoons would get a bit tired.  Don't worry.  The show is a funny and fresh as it ever was.  There is a GI Joe parody half way through that's worth the price of admission.At the same time characters who started as transparent parodies have grown and become fully realized characters that viewers can care about.This is one of the best cartoons on TV and I recommend picking it up.
B001ATJQB4,Stanley  C. Sargent "Stanley C. Sargent",5,This is my favorite animated show and I loved this 3rd season when aired on TV as much as I loved the first two seasons. BUT PLEASE STOP CENSORING THE DVD SETS!
B001BXQ97I,C E Matthews,5,My son loves Batman and this is a decent show for him to watch. While he does prefer live action - this seemed to entertain him.
B001BXQ97I,denmich1997,4,Batman as detective more than a vigilante.  Mark Hamill as the Joker and you get to see how most of Batman's foes started.  Some are great stories with very little Batman.
B001BXQ97I,Dreamcat,5,I love this Batman. Film makers should look to this version of Batman when casting their various versions. Kevin Conroy's voice does this cartoon Batman justice. The voice matches the tall and broody Dark Knight.
B001BXQ97I,E. Helms,5,This is one of my favorite animated batman series. This is not for younger kids due to some of the more adult story lines and situations. Still good clean good vs evil storyline.
B001BXQ97I,Kevin burns "kevin Burns",5,the best batman animated was from 1992 and still is highly recommend the graphics are far better than the newest ones
B001BXQ97I,Mike,5,What can I say this has to be the best animation of a cartoon series I have ever seen not to mention it was way ahead of it time when it came out and still going strong as far as stories go directing and development especially with the first 3 season of the seasons.
B001BXQ97I,Rusty the dog,5,This is one of the best American cartoon series of all time. The production is made for each 20 something minute show on a movie caliber. The music and transitions are amazing. The characterization of seeing into the eyes of different antagonists (even the sociopath joker) to  and seeing batman as a man with odds with his own psychopathic tendencies and past mistakes.
B001BXQ97I,Wes B.,4,This version is more like the history of Batman.  It shows how he is developed into the hero he is and how the supporting characters factor into who he is as a person.
B001C34W2Q,Douglas W. Fielder,5,Great collection of movie trivia all about Heston.  He was an interesting character in his own life!
B001C34W2Q,loyce "Media Maven",5,So enjoyed seeing the performances of this impacting actor whose films have entertained and thrilled.  Enjoyed hearing the opinions of fellow actors
B001CB8NQE,cneumer,5,They did a nice job.  Characters were interesting.  Plots plausible and stimulating.  Good resolution to issues.  Dialog allowed to be genuine.
B001CB8NQE,D. Avila "Science Fiction Rules!!",5,The others before me have given great reviews of some episodes and characters so I won't repeat them.I'm here to say buy this and all  seasons-if you love scifi this show and SG1 are one of the best.Can't wait for the movies to start coming out on dvd!
B001CB8NQE,DebB,5,Hated for this to be over! I wish they made more Sci Fi like this!
B001CB8NQE,George Beltz,4,I was confused on a couple of episodes until I seen how they fit into the story. Great ending to the series.
B001CB8NQE,Knight68 "EM",5,This series deserves five stars. Season Five is the final season but unlike other series didn't let up on the storylines.  Each episode was worth the time to view it.Knight68
B001CB8NQE, Leah  "Leah",4,I LOVED the first 3 seasons of Stargate Atlantis. Till they started to rip off movies. But I still watched. The only really good ep. I felt was Tracker. But The series was a good one. Joe Flanigan as John Shepared? Love him.Really like the whole story lines but is was never the same after Carson and Weir left.
B001CB8NQE,L. Grant,5,Not quite par with the original Stargate SG-1 in my book but this was a good spinoff series that carried its own weight and did well with the stories.  I thought it ended the series nicely too.  Some last episodes can try too hard but this one did a decent job.  Overall I enjoyed the series and the characters were strong and people you cared to know.  I will say they were a little annoying killing off some lead characters but other than that good.
B001CB8NQE,LT,5,Stargate Atlantis is one of my all time favorite series.  The cast is excellent and the plot takes a couple unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting.  Just finished going through the series a second time and am sorry they didn't make one more season.
B001CB8NQE,Paul A Ream Jr,5,Another great season of a great show. Really wish it wasn't over. What an entertaining show with such a diverse cast of characters. Gotta love it
B001CB8NQE,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),5,While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....
B001CB8NQE,Robert E. Leone "Aim Higher Books",5,Love it! only wish the series would have continued and/or the made a movie! I liked the characters interaction and loyalty.
B001CB8NQE,Rotatiller,4,All 5 seasons of Stargate Atlantis series are good. They had a great series but in season 4 lost a couple of major characters thathurt them. Then in the last season it started going down hill. It is still good and fun to watch but disappointed that they fell apart and this was the last season.
B001CB8NQE,Ruby Chrisman,5,We really enjoyed this season as a family.  Their are a few episodes that are not as interesting as the others. The special effectts are good and the science fiction premise is also interesting.
B001CB8NQE,Vulcanicus,5,it's always a sad time when you reach the final season of characters you invested so much time in. Especially enjoyed the last two episodes the second to the last one reminded me of the Robert Rodriguez film in terms of the music that was used. there are numerous episodes that are more memorable than others. And of course some of these showcase the acting ability of each separate team member on the show.honestly think the corporate executive should turn loose of some mega bucks and start making movies based on the series the go deep into the various alien cultures that were shown the first 5 seasons
B001CH44YI,Dangerman "Dan G.",4,I find the obsessive-compulsive detective very entertaining and funny.  Great characters and usually funny dialogue along with solid mystery techniques.  He might drive some people to distraction with all his phobias but as a tv series it's fun.  Tony Shaloub is perfect as Adrian Monk.
B001CH44YI,DM "dm",5,Received the package in excellent condition.  Was excited to watch this season.  He is so very funny and indeed a message is being portrayed.
B001CH44YI,Donna Smith,5,Every season of Monk just gets better and better. I never get enough. Monk is a character we can all identify with in one way or another!
B001CH44YI,DVDwatcher,5,Monk was a really good show. I have enjoyed all the seasons and I think this was one show that even got better as it went along.
B001CH44YI,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here.  Really adds a lot to the series.
B001CMQH5M,Maximilian K. Biltz,4,It is good but so old that the producers could not take advantage of animation which helps with war documentaries.
B001CNRBEC,Scott T. Hall "AMG Metal",5,Show is like an addictive drug. Once you start watching Saving Grace you will not be able to stop watching.
B001DD9QDK,Agentss "Dana",5,Great picture and audio quality and many episodes you feel like you are watching a feature length movie. I would recommend seeing this even if you are not a Science geek or SciFi fan
B001DD9QDK,Amazon Customer "Grandpa Jack",5,I have really enjoyed watching Eureka. The first to seasons introduced all of the key characters and a lot of the projects of the company that built the town. Season 3 brings several changes including that the children have grown older and graduated or advanced scientific minded teens. I love seeing the new projects and their results. The roles of Fargo and of Jo change. Excellent show. Very good imagination.
B001DD9QDK,Daphne,5,Great program for the family no sex bad language or real violence good family show you must watch from season 1 to understand
B001DD9QDK,D. Powers "wall paperer",3,what annoys me the most is the cliffhanger left at the end of each episode. makes it hard to stop watching when you have nothing to do.
B001DD9QDK,Fred D. Lewis "Derf8me",4,This is a good way to spend 45 minutes. This show is lighthearted and fun to watch.
B001DD9QDK,Inky,4,This show took a while to grow on me but I really enjoy it now. The characters are unique and there aren't many shows like it.
B001DD9QDK,John C Miller,5,the first three and most of the forth was great but it kind of fell apart kind of lost what made it a great show to start with.
B001DD9QDK,linda21,5,My husband likes it. It's science fiction I  personality  do not go for shows like this.  This show is on his favorite list  if I am busy he puts this on cause he knows I do not care for it. If you like science fiction you will like rhis
B001DD9QDK,Neelahofnafia,5,Like to watch on Kindle late in evening. Funny and yet addictive. Like the characters in it and stories are pretty enterning.
B001DD9QDK,Onthepedals,5,We really enjoyed Eureka. Has all the right ingredients for our type of Sci - Fi..comedy and drama with some thought provoking ideas thrown in. It's ashamed this series was cancelled while lesser shows survive.
B001DD9QDK,Robert Bowen,5,Great show.  Great acting.  Great scenarios and story lines.  Always a lot of fun.  Will be sorry when I'm at the end of the series.  Luckily still have a a couple seasons left.
B001DD9QDK,Stormdemon "Vertrauen Respekt",5,Mixture of events in Eureka life.  New boss with personal agenda and on the personal side there are interesting developments in love.  And of course the &#34;dull&#34; scientific/technological events to keep everyone busy...
B001DD9QDK,Sue Boyle "blue9244",5,I have thoroughly enjoyed this series - and this 3rd season was just as entertaining as the previous 2.  I really love that I don't have to sit through endless commercials and can watch whenever I want to watch.
B001DD9QDK,Travis Anderson,5,Great show absolutely love this series I hope it continues to stay this good. I would love for this show to stay on for years to come.
B001ENLHX6,Adam Richards "that dude",5,Not much to review. Quicker than expected delivery a plus.  And a great season of HIMYM.
B001ENNJSC,Scott Stevenson,5,BY FAR - The funniest episode in &#34;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&#34;  It's not just the main story but the subplot of Dee trying to create her own Sex and the City 'girls club' is hilarious.
B001ENOB8Y,Frankie D,5,This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell. Brought back  a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season. This show had good twists and a shocking ending. Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series.
B001ENOB8Y,Holy Conscious,5,The DVD arrived on time and is in great condition.  I would recommend this seller and definitely use again.
B001ENOB8Y,Jim "Pimmy",4,Scolfield (Wentworth Miller) and Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and the others find themselves working with an FBI agent (Michael Rapaport). He claims he'll clear their names if they steal something from the Company that's very important to them. While Sarah is really alive and joins Michael's team.That's only the beginning of the season. There's many twists and turns as the season goes on. This last season certainly doesn't disappoint and it's probably the best next to season 1. The season was packed with action and drama. The series finale was one of the more satisfying ones to any show. The only thing that bugged me a little was the very end but I can't really say it didn't work. It's just not how I preferred to see it end.
B001ENOB8Y,Lisa M. Ludwig "booklover",4,I love this series but the ending was really bad. Seemed like the writers were just tired and didn't try too hard.
B001ENSOVO,2510cheesecake,5,This show does not disappoint! I continue to root for Booth and Bones in all aspects of their lives! Great show! Season 4 is an excellent season!!!
B001ENSOVO,Dena Leasure,5,I have watched this show every week on tv.  It is such a good show with some comedy and drama both in it.  I now have seasons 1-4 and plane to watch them at a later time.
B001ENSOVO,Ed Joines,5,I started watching reruns of this show. I got hooked on it and had to add it to my small collection.
B001ENSOVO,Jacqueline A. Conney-forero "jaqtwo",5,Pretty much the same show so if you liked the other 3 seasons than you will like this season as well
B001ENSOVO,justnora,5,As always Bones delivers intrigue and suspense. The dynamics of the cast makes this show work as no others and the characters are so believable in their roles that they just &#34;must&#34; be those people off camera! I love this show and hope that it runs forever.
B001ENSOVO,K. Marlow "Kat",5,I am a very loyal fan of this series I love the humor of watching someone with out emotions try to be normal around highly emotional people and situations plus the gore is great
B001ENSOVO,Lincoln County MT "Focused on pinecones",5,Ok why do we have to wait so long not just for Bones but all the other DVD TV series on a yearly basis? We don't get paid for TV here and so depend on the series by DVD arrivals. Of course we then scarf them up so quick within less than a week usually...it's one heck of a long wait for next years episodes. Yes we occasionally sneak peaks via the free net viewers in 2 x 3 frames but that only wets the appetite and our impatience even more. So if anyone is listening that decides these dates.....why not put them out within a 2-3 week ending of the season? Meantime the show...BONES is by far our favorite. I didn't like it for the first original 3 episodes but the 4th began to thaw me and by the 5th I was hooked. Writing is tight and casting tighter. Love the comedy most of all. Sure they could improve this or that to make me like it even more...but hey life is a compromise.If you gave this a try when it first came out but wasn't taken in...go back and give it another look. I wasn't quite taken by last years plot of making Zack a serial killer. That definitely weird for weirds sake. Nothing like writing a character off without exactly killing him off traditionally. I never warmed to Zacks character...so I don't miss him or feel for his persona living behind those cold cold bars:) Hope it runs another 5 years......or more.....
B001ENSOVO,Lois,5,I bought this for my sister as she is now a bones follower and does not have the whole collection and little by little she is getting it and I am helping  yeah....
B001ENSOVO,Lynn,5,You can really see by now that Booth and Brennan are made for each other. They can't help but get together real soon. The episodes are so good you get addicted!
B001ENSOVO,michaelaen_37841,5,Bones are the best series and if you like crime and love storys then this is the best series for you
B001ENSOVO,M. Skiles "r_vin",5,I have all of the current seasons and I can't stop loving this show!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys procedurals and doesn't mind seeing dead bodies on TV.
B001ENSOVO,Nat,5,The only way I can keep up with the show is to get the seasons. I work overseas and am able to keep up this way.
B001ENSOVO,V Johnson,5,Here in this season we really got some weird cases but the characters were developing even more.  You got to learn more about their backgrounds before they all got together.
B001EUE6X2,Alfonzo "charter duck",4,I loved watching this without commercials and episode after episode.  It is fun watching the changes in Sylar and this volume was very good.
B001EUE6X2,al,5,i have always been a fan of hero's.  very entertaining i think kinda like watching a marvel movie.  you gotta see this show.
B001EUE6X2,Bandaid12,5,family love to sit down and watch this together. Love Hiro! Kids really enjoy the show as well as us adults!
B001EUE6X2,Donna,5,Watching Season Three got me hooked on the series again.  I recently also purchased Season 4.  I will get 5 & 6 at a later date.
B001EUE6X2,I. McKinzie,5,If you don't keep up with each and every episode ... you totally lose the whole spectrum of what is going on in this series ... but I am hooked !
B001EUE6X2,MICKEYY,5,It had action suspense at times it was funny I would recommend this to everyoneYou should watch it from the beginning
B001EUE6X2,Nicole Lewis,5,love the show. wish it was still on but love being able to watch anytime I want too love it
B001EUE6X2,Pat Etzwiler,5,Wish they would have more shows like this. Networks have moved away from si-Fi for some reason. Nothing on network TV worth watching.
B001EUE6X2,St Johns,4,I am not sure if the writers were having issues but do not feel going to a Circus back drop was right for the show.  Also would of rather seen a clear cut ending among the characters and their lives. Left hanging.
B001EUE6X2,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",4,I really enjoyed  this series.  At number three it was getting a little too redundant.  But I was utterly entertained for two seasons!
B001EUE6X2,Terri,4,I have just started watch volume 3 but so far it seems to be pretty good maybe not as good and the first 2 seasons was but it is still worth watching
B001EUE6X2,Vicki Fleming,3,The first two seasons were well worth watching.  Season three was so disappointing.  Was very tired of the justification in rounding up the &#34;different&#34; people.
B001EXO256,mom12,5,I wish real - life work could be this silly and we could make fun of ourselves and also say wild things and have crazy flashbacks and laugh at work. the cast works well together as if they actually were these characters. fey is brilliant and I love her woman-whose-got -it -all but totally doesn't character. she's a mess on the inside.
B001EXRQQ8,Amazon Customer,5,Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi are two excellent actors and do a great job in a really written series.  Each episode has a self-contained story within a broader story arc over the full season.  My wife loved the series as well.
B001EXRQQ8,Book Lover,4,This is not my favorite TV show.  If it wasn't free on Amazon Prime I am not sure I would purchase it.  It is too dull.
B001EXRQQ8,brenda "open door",5,As I wrote in the review for season one.  This is a good show and the only thing I am unhappy about is that it is no longer being produced. Considering how many really bad shows are on the air I just don't understand why a good one like this fails.  Except the name and description don't sound interesting.  The show is though.
B001EXRQQ8,Brian "batfan",5,Great show. The second season was digging deeper into Charlie's enemies and it was just so compelling.  Side stories were getting good.  All the actors are top notch and on their game.  I wish NBC would have renewed it or another network would have picked it up.
B001EXRQQ8,bruce,5,IMO probably the best cop series I've ever seen. Very good writing and acting with a good cast. Damn shame it didn't run for a few more years.
B001EXRQQ8,cg showalter,5,When this series first came on TV a friend of mine told me how good it was but I didn't have the opportunity to watch it.  I am so thrilled AMAZON had it and I watched every single one of them..It's a great show!!!!!
B001EXRQQ8,Czosnek,5,It was a great a show on TV. Was nice to be able to see the episodes I missed. Should have kept this series going longer.
B001EXRQQ8,D Christiansen,5,Charlie is awesome! Loved this show - wish it would have continued! Thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime and watch every episode.
B001EXRQQ8,Deanna R Taylor,5,Life is the best cop series I have ever seen.  I wish it had had more than two seasons but think it would have ruined the whole concept of the show.  The characters and acting is superb.
B001EXRQQ8,Debbie Dillon,5,I loved this show. I did a Life marathon and hated when it ended. I will probably watch it again.
B001EXRQQ8,DMZE "Eric",5,A quirky police mystery show with appealing characters. A wronged police officer returned to the force after 12 years in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit. Tempted to seek revenge but now with a new outlook on life--will he ever find out who set him up?They had to wrap up this series way too soon!
B001EXRQQ8,Duffer513,4,It has an interesting though sometimes unbelievable main story line with unique side stories being solved each episode.  Just when you think you've figured it out it goes off on a tangent to confuse you more!  Thoroughly enjoyable cop series.  Too bad it was canceled!
B001EXRQQ8,E. Lillian Creveling,5,I really enjoyed this show. I wish more detective shows were like this one. Too bad they had to put a sex scene in it. The show would have done better without that.
B001EXRQQ8,Flying Lady 76 "N2theBlue",5,I think it was a remarkable show.  The mystery continued right up until the last episode of season 2.  Great acting.  I didn't get the ending about the choice between Charlie and the Russian.  Why was Nicklokov (err not sure about the spelling) jealous of Charlie?  I must have missed something.Too bad it went the way of too many other shows that were interesting.  Hunting for another Prime TV show to watch.
B001EXRQQ8,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Damien Lewis is great in this role!  We really looked forward to watching each episode.  Would highly recommend this series.
B001EXRQQ8,grandma,4,Sometimes it is a little out there but still enjoy the hummer.  It is lite entertainment.  Enjoy the actors and the people they portray.
B001EXRQQ8,Jo Ann Massaro,5,I stumbled upon this series and am now a huge fan. The main character is an odd ball who has figured out how to survive the hand he was dealt. Each story has good plots. The characters are interesting and quirky. The main mystery continues from one episode to the next.I am now on series 2 and don't want this series to end!
B001EXRQQ8,John Ward,5,Love this show......the characters- the depth and pealing back of each person involved....the fight between good and bad....the overwhelming feel of somehow things will come out ok by the end.....it's fascinating and the actors are superb ! Each episode is different and is compelling.
B001EXRQQ8,Justicried,5,This was a great series & they did a good job of wrapping the story up by the end of season 2.  I still wish they had added a few more seasons.  All of the actors did a great job and the humor helped endear the characters to me.  You are never quite sure what Charlie is thinking or hiding under his ultra calm demeanor.  It is a fun watch to find out.
B001EXRQQ8,lilychrystie,5,Cute procedural (uptight pretty girl detective and free spirit male detective) with above average writing. Magical performances by Damian Lewis make this more than watchable.
B001EXRQQ8,M. A. Griffin,4,Off beat but still interesting show.  I like the back story involving Det. Cruz and I hope to find out who and why he was &#34;framed&#34;.The supporting characters are great and the writing makes you care about them.  I want this series to continue.
B001EXRQQ8,Mary Coleman,4,Really enjoyed this series. One downer is that it seems to keep dragging on and on instead of new issues each season.  But still is very interesting.
B001EXRQQ8,Michael B.,5,This was a great show that I was very disappointed to have seen go off the air. NBC makes blunders like all the rest of them and this was one of them by removing this show. At least they didn't leave you up in the air like FOX with the Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles. The show is best watched in HD.
B001EXRQQ8,M. McCarty "hippy chick",5,I liked this show and the chemistry between Adam Arkin's character and Damien Lewis.  I would have liked to have seen Damien Lewis' partner throughout the season rather than a &#34;guest&#34; fill-in temp partner.  Like Damien and Sarah's chemistry on screen.
B001EXRQQ8,Mom of an ultimate frisbee geek,4,This show is very entertaining and reminds me of the tv series castle which I enjoy watching.Damien Lewis is one of my favorite actors.
B001EXRQQ8,mrs natural,5,I received and email from Amazon on some recommendations and this was on that list.  We decided to check it out and glad we did but just sorry that it was only 2 seasons.  Never heard of this show before and it aired back in 08. We have one show left so I am curious on how it ended for this season. Maybe they could do what the Veronica Mars people did and bring it back for a movie to finish up any loose ends.
B001EXRQQ8,neon,5,Very addictive and sometimes even very informative on different topics . writers have great sense of humor and getting very addictive
B001EXRQQ8,pj ellen,5,I just discovered this program and I love it.  I just wish there were more to watch.  The characters were fun to watch.
B001EXRQQ8,P. Lafayette "revalois",5,I  loved this way back when it first showed on TV.  Why do they dump good shows and make these crappy ones today in year 2013'
B001EXRQQ8,Raymond J. Brunner,4,Great show to watch and it makes you think as the plot thickens. My wife enjoys it as much as I do.
B001EXRQQ8,Richard L Thompson,5,Hope newer seasons appear.
B001EXRQQ8,Richard R,5,THE STORY LINES ARE INTERESTING AND WELL DONE. THE ACTING IS BELEAVABLE.THE UNDERLINING STORY OF A COP IS VERY INTERESTING
B001EXRQQ8,Robert D. Richter,1,The first series was average with some interest however the second year the characters seem to degrade. The writer seemed to loose his direction and the stories became more unbelievable.
B001EXRQQ8,Robertson Davies "George",5,Not just Damiano Lewis - the entire cast is superb. The writing is taut and directlng way above average. Don't know now I missed this series during it's original run but glad I stumbled across it! Given it an hour and you will be hooked!
B001EXRQQ8,R. S. Neilson "Preacher",4,My wife and I really enjoyed the main character and his unique way of doing things. The show was fresh and interesting. I was disappointed they only made two seasons.
B001EXRQQ8,Sam,3,One of the best shows I've watched in a long time. Damien Lewis is the best. Keep them coming please
B001EXRQQ8,steve allison "steve",3,the show was very interesting. I could not wait for the ending. That being said the ending was the worst I ever saw. It really is a shame after watching 2 seasons that they came up with this ending. Very sad
B001EXRQQ8,Sunni,5,Each episode ends leaving you with the &#34;have to hurry and watch the next episode&#34;. Outstanding cast of actors. I recommend this tv series to all adults that enjoy mystery policemen shows.
B001EXRQQ8,tad a jach,5,Usually a series will &#34;hit their stride&#34; by the 2nd or 3rd season.  Life had its &#34;stride&#34; from the very first episode and kept right on going to the very last episode of the second season.  Watch the first and second season as a &#34;miniseries&#34; because we'll not be seeing any more of this great series. Too bad.
B001EXRQQ8,Tammie Hurst,5,This series is very entertaining and I like it very much.  I enjoy this type of series and am sad that they didn't make more seasons.
B001EXRQQ8,TL in SB,5,This series only ran two years and the writers tied up the story line beautifully and it was very satisfying.  It got a bit complicated mid-season but it was well worth watching all the episodes.  The actors and the characters are great.
B001EXRQQ8,twesjewel,5,Excellent series and so neat to watch without advertising. Characters are strong and the plots exciting.  Watch it!  Better than national stations that haven't got a clue.
B001EXRQQ8,Verna Metzger,5,This is a great series. Of course you wouldn't normally have a detective who was once in prison but his wrong conviction and subsequent release makes this part of his character.
B001EXRQQ8,Wayne Midkiff,5,This was one of the shows that was cancelled that should have not been. Was a great show for action and drama. With a few laughs.
B001EXRQQ8,Wolfgang "Film & TV",5,What a great show!BEST SEASON ENDING (of a crime TV show) OF THE DECADE!All the other writers for TV can learn here how it`s really done....
B001F6ZIXC,Amazon Customer,5,Love this show me and my husband watch this together. He is really picky when it comes to television. I &#60;3 Jax
B001F6ZIXC,A. Paine "ThrillerLover!",5,I loved this - I'm now hooked on the Son's of Anarchy&#34; and will watch the rest of the series!
B001F6ZIXC,azloree,3,This did not really hold my interest nor my husband's interest so we quit watching after 3 or 4 episodes.
B001F6ZIXC,Bill K,4,Season 2 continues to be great story telling. However this series is not for everyone. Quite violent. Show walks a very fine line.
B001F6ZIXC,Bob,4,THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS BASED ON THEIR INTERTWINED LIVES MAKES IT MORE THEN A BIKER SHOW. THE TWIST AND TURNS OF THE PLOT KEEPS THE SUSPENSE UP FRONT . NEVER A DULL MOMENT.
B001F6ZIXC,BrotherSpider "Spider",5,the show mixes action and story pretty well. it captures the outlaw biker (from what i've seen) very well. there is just one minor problem. people from the inland valley of california don't use such big callege words. this is obvously written by someone with an education and not an outlaw biker from the valley.i just found this show and friends of mine say the other seasons are better. i can hardly waitand Katie Segal is HOT in her tight jeans
B001F6ZIXC,diane,4,It seems like I watch only to see everyone get whats coming to them.  The only character I do not wish ill is babies!!
B001F6ZIXC,dlrespaul,5,It was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4
B001F6ZIXC,Donna L. Piccioli "n2 TINK",5,How can you not be addicted to this show? So many people are hooked on it!  Glad to own it.
B001F6ZIXC,Elizabeth Marshall "Elizabeth Marshall",5,I find this series unique as it draws both pathos and anger in equal measure.  Always a surprise!  See it!
B001F6ZIXC,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,I love this DVD set.  I received this set before date promised.  I now have the entire collection.  I love this series.
B001F6ZIXC,Hunt "CG",5,I put off watching this show even though my kid told me it was addictive....this show had me hooked from the beginning
B001F6ZIXC,irabby,4,Interesting and is attempting to create its own philosophical base which seems to be slowly building to a confrontation between the two main characters. I believe that the attempt to romanticize the story and make the characters into heroes is somewhat unbelievable but works in the context of the story. The attempt to create non stereotypical characters works with some and doesn't with other. It has my interest and I will continue to see how the story develops
B001F6ZIXC,Jack Carter,1,Too much talking with irrelevant dialog. Not my kind of show. Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian
B001F6ZIXC,James Gaan "PaiGowMaster",5,Great show. Excellent series...Must Watch. Amazon Prime Video Service is the best..Quality is excellent. 5 Stars. Best motorcycle Gang show ever made.
B001F6ZIXC,Jessica,5,This show is amazing. I can not wait for the next season to start. Hot guys and hot exciting action.
B001F6ZIXC,Jodel,5,We bought this copy of SOA as a gift for someone. We are totally hooked on this show and can't wait for the next season to come out!
B001F6ZIXC,J-Squared,5,my wife and i love the show.  can't wait to watch the other seasons which are also on amazon prime.
B001F6ZIXC,Meggan "Meggan",5,I fell in love the minute I seen Peg Bundy on the screen as a bad girl. Love it and Jax is goregous.
B001F6ZIXC,Northerngal,5,This is a totally addictive show.  One of the few I've watched all seasons of.  Great writing and acting - wish it would never end.
B001F6ZIXC,nurse_judith,5,I am glued to this exciting season 1.  Getting to know the character's and loving them. SAMCRO - SON'S OF ANARCHY - S.O.N'S are a Northern Calif bad boy bike club living and doing legal and illegal business in the town of &#34;Charming&#34;.  The illegal part of their business is what fans the heat and creates hovac for the boy's.  Adult show. Can't wait for season 2.
B001F6ZIXC,Rebecca Collins,5,I rated this 5 starts because I enjoy the show -- it is tantalizing - and I cannot put it down.The only negative parts that I would change are some of the words/language used which is very stout  - and some of the scenes which are a little too sexual graphic .. but the show overall is a good one.
B001F6ZIXC,Ronald F. Paull,1,Not all that realistic. Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1%ers. Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits.
B001F6ZIXC,rose,4,fx packaged this wrong by saying on the lable that there was commentary on an episode when in fact there was not...FX owned up to the wrong typing on it so that was nice...but before a product goes to a store FX needs to check their packaging. this has nothing to do with the seller on here..but the original person..FX
B001F6ZIXC,R Walsh "R .W.",4,Motorcycle gang-type shows are not my style but I gave it a shot and found the story-line to be very intriguing. I found the second season was better than the first. The seasons get better and better.  I'm only on season 3 and love it.
B001F6ZIXC,SusieQ "Carwalker",5,This was a wonderful surprise. I hadn't expected such a thrilling storyline.I do not miss an episode now.  You'll love it too.
B001F6ZIXC,suzatm,5,Excellent series!  All of the actors are fantastic.  This show is very addictive and keeps you glued to you seat the whole time.
B001F6ZIXC,TD,5,This show was not what I expected at all. I really thought it was about old white men riding bikes living away from society trying to preserve their golden years. Boy was I wrong. This show is like new jack city meets scarface meets the god father who then meets training day. Lol. I watched all 5 seasons in one week!!! I was totally hooked.  You actually see each character develop and you can actually relate to their plight in some strange way. You kind of start rooting for the characters although socially and morally there actions need to be condemned. Definitely more graphic and explicit than any show I have ever scene. At one point I thought this must be the unedited version.  But nope  FX is the new HBO for cable. Lol. Just started watching the new season 6 and it is very graphic as well.
B001G8MP9Y,C. Carnrike "book keeper",5,Just started Season 6 - I enjoyed the first 4 episodes...I have lots of catching up to do and am glad Amazon provided the DVDs at such a great price.  NCIS fan.
B001G8MP9Y,Galen M. Ozawa "ozworks",5,There are many reasons that this is a very popular TV series.  The characters are likeable and excellently acted.  The stories are interesting well written.  The whole effort is a masterly mix that makes an excellent show.
B001G8MP9Y,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,The story lines have progressed beyond the death of the week and we see a lot of character expansion in this year.  Production values are still good.
B001G8MP9Y,Kris,5,I ordered all seasons and have had no problems with any of them. If you like the show then order them. Came fast and no problems with the DVDs.
B001G8MP9Y,Leighann,5,I grew up in a military family and i love this show!! It definitly the only crime show i watch on TV!
B001G8MP9Y,nelly123,5,I love this series and the storylines i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years for sure
B001G8MP9Y,Rotatiller,5,This is by far the best show ever made. I own them all and will continue to buy each new season. The cast is perfect and the writer writes very interesting and fun shows. I love NCIS in every way!
B001G8U0VY,gregory,5,I love Survivor Gabon a lot it was really fun that the Fang and Kota are the Gabon Tribes nice
B001G8U0VY,JB,5,No spoilers.I enjoyed this season very much. I found it entertaining throughout the entire thing and there were some standout characters that I'll remember for quite some time.
B001G8U0VY,L. Robinson,5,I could watch Survivor every day and not get tired of it.  It is better than watching hourly drama's that you already know the ending to.
B001G8U0VY,MattyBoy717,5,Survivor. Jeff Probst is the best. Gabon was very good. Surprise winner. You'll love it. Africa at its best. Buy this.
B001GDO7TA,CARRIE,5,This is a great show with alot of entertainment and drama.  I have all the seasons. It is fun to watch from start to finish.
B001GIIRYQ,Jason Nobody,1,This season stinks. It is preachy with no punchline. It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5. The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer doesn't help either. That character is best in really small doses. Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all... I'd kinda like a refund. Maybe Alan Shore will take my case :-)
B001GQG07O,Duffer513,4,Excellent classic British who done it!  Good series about a quirky detective who uses his brains to solve murders! Strong supporting cast as well!
B001GQG07O,Ginger L. Gilmore,4,With Inspector Morse you get the sense that there is something more not spoken there. I recommend it for those who enjoy mysteries with mild humor. The video quality was very good considering that age of the original product.
B001GQG07O,John O. McMurren,5,Me like. You like too if you watch. We like together. Tell others. They like. Much goodness come from this...
B001GQG07O,Marion M. Giuffria "Marion6",5,Inspector Morse never disappoints.  His story leads to the inevitable conclusion without tremendously distractin complications or superhuman feats of strength.  Lewis always plays his part as his sidekick and together they make an umbeatable team.
B001GQHV36,cindylou,5,It's as good as I remembered it from the original broadcast.  It is thought provoking.  Current for the era. PG rated.  Very entertaining.
B001GQHV36,Marie Silverman "nysefox",5,I agree with Jeeves! I hope Amazon gets permission to offer the rest of the series (12 in total) now that 'Endeavor' has become the prequel to Morse. Both are absolutely the best!
B001GRVAUU,jojo,5,No complaints.  Got a great price and good quality.  Have watched it several times.  Love the show.  If your looking for laughs you should watch the show.  I have watched these disks about 10 times and have not stopped working yet like dvds i bought at a big box store.
B001GRVMLM,Bertha Scoggins,5,Great show and I wish they would have kept going on with season 5 plus... less immorality would be nice.
B001GRVMLM,C Bismuth "CatB; CroquetCreative/HypFoods",5,but I have integrated many of the characters into my internal compass. They help me to live into strength and courage. They remind me how to pray for those who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe and secure. THANK YOU for an excellent series that ended much too soon!
B001GRVMLM,corpgirl,5,The seasons have continued to get better and better. You never can guess what's coming and the action doesn't stop. My only complaint is that Season 4 was the last season and the last episode left me in Unit withdrawal for a couple days!  Wish they would come back for a reunion episode to close out some things.
B001GRVMLM,Desiree Merrick,5,I love and loved this show.  It was so cheap of FOX and/CBS to cancel this show.  The Unit was the only military serial show I have ever gotten into mostly because the missions were such a huge part of the show and the family life a side dish  I don't think more seasons will ever be made and that is unfortunate.
B001GRVMLM,James A. Trinka,5,I wish that this series was still ongoing.  I guess it would have been hard to keep story lines going over several more seasons as this one was played out.  Some issues still remain though should an enterprising writer and producer team up to go on.  The characters are fabulous.  Well done and highly recommended.
B001GRVMLM,james,5,This season has lots of twists & turns & you will not want to miss a second of it. It is nail biting good. I can't wait til Season 5 can be available.
B001GRVMLM,jo ann lovett,5,The excitement was great.  Love each episode.  Wish there was a season 5.Hate it when one of the good guys gets killed.
B001GRVMLM,John R,5,The writing made the complete series enjoyable to watch.It seemed that each episode was really hapenning now or could in the near future.
B001GRVMLM,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,I watched the first season and found it to be enjoyable. The second season turned me off so I did not continue. I tried the first episodeof season four and found it as exciting as season one. The writers of season four did an excellent job. It is well worth your time to watch. Sit back and enjoy.
B001GRVMLM,maurice cortez,5,A few cast changes but still are great show. What more can I say... Wish there were more seasons? *
B001GRVMLM,MsMouse "MsMouse",5,best military series on TV too bad they discontinued it!!! Great acting and great story line!
B001GRVMLM,New2This,5,This has become one of our family's great TV favorites.Superbly done.  Can not understand why they would havecanceled this program.
B001GRVMLM,nurse_judith,5,The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.
B001GRVMLM,O. Mallard,5,Just as exciting and addictive as all the other seasons. I love this show and wish it was still on television
B001GRVMLM,pd,5,Wow! Patriotism - God - self sacrifice. The producers certainly are out of step with most TV and Hollyweird. Refreshing and entertaining.  Brings home how poorly we treat out military and their families.
B001GRVMLM,Ronald W. Pramshcufer,5,It's ashamed that this series had to end. A bit of a unique twist surrounded the entire season so you were really kept guessing with not onl the soldiers but the wives... and not just who they are sleeping with.  Great ending to a great series.
B001GRVMLM,sharon kemm,5,each episode is unique in itself and you want to see more. the families have a big responsibility of protecting their men in service and keeping quiet about the unit. the men in the field are quick and respond with efficiency. as I said it's a must see. good writers and excellent actors. I didn't want the last episode to end. I wanted more and to see molly and her husband reunite.
B001GRVMLM,THOMAS,5,The last episode is very telling for the lead character and his wife - unanticipated !!!Will they ever get back together?
B001GRVMLM,Timothy J. Gannon,5,This was an action packed series and the last season was as good as the first. I liked the technique of two stories running in parallel. The personal interactions of people and friends and wives with their various problems was very realistic. he series skips the long hours of boring training and life between hot action.
B001GRVMLM,Wayward Traveller "WaywardT",5,I still can't believe this show was cancelled this season. With 12 different cop shows staying on forever the one about special forces with good characters gets cancelled? I still enjoy watching this show time after time.
B001HBLE2O,Kelly S. Larue "Kelly",5,I found this series to be so unbelievable and boring that I didn't finish the DVD.  Some people will enjoy it a lot.
B001HINEH0,Cestmoi,3,The GOOD- Containing Original drawings of the books- The animation does add value to the books. It makes them like a cartoon movie than still pictures. It's interestingThe BAD- Only one-voice narrating.It's very annoying to hear an animated woman figure speak with a man's voice! It significantly reduces the entertaining value of these DVDs.It's still worth watching.
B001HINEH0,Chongo,5,This was easily the best DVD to come out all year! It's an awesome concept that's the classic comic book brought to life like no Hollywood attempt could ever conceive. While the narration is performed by just one actor it's still wonderfully done & its setting the stage for next wave of entertainment. I hope DC puts out more releases like this becuase motion comics are gonna be huge!
B001HINEH0,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",2,Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch.  The "motion comic" concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak.  Apparently they only have one narrator.  Multiple narrators would make this much better.
B001HWT3TE,Barbara A. Kephart,5,I do not understand why this show was cancelled.  It had me both in stitches and on the edge of my seat to see what antics the characters were going to get themselves into.  I would love it if they brought this show back with all the original cast.
B001HWT3TE,Christine A. Rushbrook,5,This is about the life of a once rich single mom and how she tries to raise her daughter in this new life she was forced in
B001HWT3TE,Henri G. "News1",5,Its a Soap Opera for sure.  But it is more like &#34;Sex in the City&#34; than junk.  And it deals with real issues in a fascinating and highly entertaining way.
B001HWT3TE,JB,1,There were actors from the first season that suddenly were not there and actors that were replaced with other actors - Super confusing AND much worse than the first season.
B001HWT3TE,ShopGrl09,3,I haven't really been able to get into Season 2 of the Starter Wife. They have replaced the &#34;Kenny's&#34; character ex-husband on show with a new guy that is much cuter.. (just not believable in the role of the obnoxious ex-husband/Hollywood enterainment mogul). The show is okay... just not as good as Season 1.
B001HWT3TE,Verna Metzger,3,Kind of funny in places. Love the main characters and but the story line is weak
B001HWT3TE,WTO,3,The first 2 hour show was exciting which prompted the making of season 1 but then it got silly and boring toward the end.
B001I8O2MK,nelly123,5,I love this series it is wonderful the actors are amazing and the storylines are great I would recommend this to anyone
B001JB3T02,blair,5,It's great wholesome super funny value thats sure to tickle your funny bone time and time again definitely recommend watching it!
B001JB3T02,C E Matthews,5,My ten-year-old loves this show and I am so glad he can watch it now that it's off the air on Amazon. Cute!
B001JB3T02,johnny,4,at first the kids watched this show and i hated it. now lol i am always asking them if they want to watch it with me lol. it grows on you.
B001JB3T02,LADONNA HARVEY "LaHarvey",5,My kids from 9 to 19 all love to sit down and watch this show. They can watch episodes over and over!
B001JB3T02,LAgirl,5,This is a smart show for kids. It doesn't make you feel all gross with some kind of silly moral to the story.  It knows how to have fun and let you in on it too:)!
B001JB3T02,melinda,5,My daughters watched this show and loved it. They didn't have any problems downloading it and it didn't have to buffer during it. Recommend to older children.
B001JB3T02,Michael Gallagher,4,iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $24.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!
B001JG5PJU,Amazon Customer,1,To easy for others to use and children to get. Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming.
B001JG5PJU,Debbifaye,5,We always watch Diego together and the time goes very quickly.  They teach her kindness and compassion and that animals sometime need our help too.
B001JG5PJU,Elisa Bohanan,5,My daughter loves every episode.  We have watched them all a ton of times!Would recommend to a parent of a toddler.
B001JG5PJU,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,I can't count the many times my grandson--who just turned three--has watched this video. He watches it over and over.
B001JG5PJU,Kristin L. Weiner,4,My boys love Diego! They could watch this show all day long. Great for kids that love animals. Go Diego Go!
B001JG5PJU,Linda Wilson,5,My granddaughter is a fan of Go Diego when she comes to my house she asks to watch it.  She is 3 1/2 and will sit through the whole show. she likes the adventure shows! So anything Diego is a hit.
B001JG5PJU,moptop64,5,My son loves this show. He is learning Spanish as well by watching it. Amazing. He likes this show better then dora now.
B001JG5PJU,M. Penager "MP",4,My son loves this show!!!!  Fun character that is not pink and purple.  Educational about animals but also the environment.
B001JGECT4,Christopher Wunsch,3,Kind of entertaining....somewhat educational My 2 year old girl seems to have liked it. What more can a dad day
B001JGECT4,Chrystal,5,My 3 yr old loves this show! It is both entertaining and educational. The variety of animals that they teach about is great.
B001JGECT4,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,Again and again Diego appeals to the young children with his adventures. His gentle ways are laced with humor kids get.
B001JGECT4,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,My 2 year old granddaughter purchased this when she was supposed to be watching Amazon Prime selections but she loves these episodes so much I cant complain. It is educational and interactive.  Great for preschoolers!
B001JGECT4,JCook,4,My granddaughter prefers Diego over Dora...I guess it is all the animals on the show. Cute show for the kids!
B001JGECT4,Kerry,5,I'm a nanny an when the kids want to watch tv I'm glad I have prime so the can watch this.
B001JGECT4,Kristin L. Weiner,5,My 5 year old is in love with Diego. It's a great show.  He loves learning about all the animals.
B001JGECT4,Melanie C Wiitanen,5,My kids love this show! We have a smart TV and are able to stream it. The stream was seamless... you wouldn't even know it!
B001JGECT4,MT,5,Go Diego go! My son loves to watch Diego and pretend that he is also on a mission to rescue an animal.
B001JGECT4,Rosie Palms,1,come on people these are for kids...  I don't care that Diego is &#34;suave.&#34;  he needs to do something with his hands other than putting them all over Dora...  Is he in this country legally by the way?  i don't want my 3 yr old exposed to an illegal immigrant or whatever they're calling them these days...  enough.
B001JGECT4,thomas marcelain,5,My son loved watchin it with so many episodes its great. These is great for the kids and having it on xbox is awesome
B001LUW8G2,Jean Marcel Ducharme,1,This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time.  Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies.
B001M432XA,Amazon Customer,5,I love this movie! The online viewing is very crisp and clear. I bought it on sale. Very pleased with my purchase!
B001M432XA,Michael P. Mcintire,5,This is one of the best movies of all times. A feel good movie that you can watch forever and ever and not get tired of. Great for the whole familh
B001M432XA,susan,5,is there really any one who hasnt seen this classic but if you havent you have to see it i just need to remind you this is an old movie
B001M432XA,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,Everyone needs to own this movie in it's original version...black and white.  It is something I watch every Christmas.  The best Holiday movie ever made with my two favorite actors...and zuzu too!
B001M432XA,vich,5,I always tear up when I see this movie.  It just never gets old.  I'll add another 5-star rating to the pile.
B001MVN03K,Amazon Customer,5,I had never watched this show before and was quite surprised and please to see how good it was.  I really like the interaction between the actors and intensiveness of each show.  I plan to watch all the seasons.  Thanks for having this part Prime Video.
B001MVN03K,Amazon Customer "Home Daddy",4,This is a nice Canadian show. Very good ensemble cast carry the NCIS/CSI like show.  Fans of BSG & other Syfi channel shows will see some familiar guest stars through out the seasons.
B001MVN03K,Babbs,5,Action packed and true to life....I love this series.  The characters are true to life and so are the scenarios...great show!
B001MVN03K,D. Greene "pooh",5,Really enjoyed watching this show. Got us hooked from the first show and have enjoyed the whole season. Would recommend.
B001MVN03K,Jim,3,All the shows were the same. Didn't like the the plots or the stories. Could have use more imagination in the series
B001MVN03K,Lorraine M. Jessee,5,I would recommend this series to anyone wanting a new series to watch to fill in free time and also introduces new characters from Canada.
B001MVN03K,neko712,4,Flashpoint has intense fast moving action.  I watch it while I am using my treadmill and it is great.  It is hard for me to stop it without finishing the show.  I do not recommend viewing it just before bedtime though.It is not a kid's show but it does not have so much sex or violence that I would be ashamed if my wife caught me watching it.
B001MVN03K,O. Mallard,5,I'm enjoying watching a few episodes every few days. I missed a lot of this series when it was on. I think it's a great show showing that police officers are people too and have feelings and emotions like any other human being.
B001MVN03K,Patricia M. Brown,4,I chose 4 stars because I like watching Police Dramas. This show is really good because it gives you a realistic look at a special unit like SWAT in the U.S. It also gives you a small look at their personal lives and the problems they face everyday.
B001MVN03K,Rosa A. Fernandez,4,Lots of action that is more normal than the power Rangers. It has the Pink Ranger and she is a Bad ass at shooting plus she looks sexy.  Well the show first show starts pretty good.
B001MVN03K,S. Clark "Friend",5,I just started watching Flashpoint three weeks ago when I was on 10 days bed rest. Shame on me! This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I don't know how it got by me for all those years. Right from the very first minute of the very first season it rocked. I'm almost at the end of the third season and it still rocks! The Characters all click; each actor is so perfectly suited to their role. I honestly can't say one negative things about Flashpoint except that the show is no longer being made! This could have easily been a 10 year run. Anyway - well worth your time if you're into this type of genre.  Yummy stuff!
B001MVN03K,sharon kemm,5,have seen parts of this series on t.v. and it's better being able to watch on kindle fire. the show keeps your attention and you get to see what actually goes on with a special unit to fight crime.
B001MVN03K,The Librarian,5,Typical in all the right ways. I really enjoy watching this show and the character building of the cast works well for flow and weekly development
B001N4PPWK,D. M MITULSKI "Twinglemom",5,I love this show!  The writing and acting are fabulous.  I love being able to see Timothy Hutton every week.  Christian Kane is another great actor although I wish his character would cut his hair.  The other actors were new to me but they all had great chemistry.  Can't wait for Season Two to start!
B001N4PPWK,Lady Raven RAVE!,5,Great show loved it since day one. It's like mission impossible and the Italian job had a wild child and this is it but in a good way. The cast gels well together and I love how the cast feeds off each other the missions are good.
B001N4PPWK,L,4,Great episode; this episode is the one that got me hooked.  Season 1 is one of the best.  The season caused me to love Leverage!
B001N4PPWK,Stephen Ingraham "lightshedder",4,Interesting characters in an interesting concept. The acting and writing improves over the course of the season. The Robin Hood character just never gets old.
B001N4PPWK,Steven T. "Steve",5,I love these shows.  They are very entertaining.  I have all the seasons and enjoy them over and over again.
B001N4PPWK,T. Brady "Tom",5,I just got this series and only watched the first episode and thought it was absolutely fabulous.  Every single character is well rounded and portrays their particular part with such great output.  I am very eager to watch the rest of the series.  I was more than impressed with the entire show.  The old saying is that you have to see it to believe it.  This is the case here.  You most definitely will believe it.
B001N4PPWK,victor,5,There is no tv show that can rival Leverage. this is the greatest written crime drama that i have ever had the pleasure of watching...
B001NJO76U,Amazon's Fan(s),5,The whole family likes watching the trials and tribulations and FUN that Mike Rowe goes through to bring us a laugh.
B001NJO76U,bike enthusiast "bike enthusiast",4,Dirty Jobs is the best series Mike Rowe has been involved with entertaining and yet informative. The best show for a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life.
B001NJO76U,Dave PA,5,Its amazing that a first season of a show is so awesome. Just all around good wholesome fun show for the whole family.
B001NJO76U,Elizabeth Johnson,5,This is the kind of reality TV we should have- real people doing the real things that make our world what it is. This show is great.
B001NJO76U,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,This season 1 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.
B001NJO792,Amazon's Fan(s),5,Mike Row is funny and self deprecating.  What he puts himself through for an acting gig is completely disgusting and funny at the same time.
B001NJO792,Ixias,5,A fun way to learn about difficult jobs. Mostly OK for kids and they warn you at the beginning of the episode when it is not.
B001NJO792,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,This season 2 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.
B001NJO792,Rock Fossil "wacowayne",4,Thuroughly enjoyed almost every episode. Like the new information I gather by watching the show. Hope to be able to see many more.
B001NJO792,WirebitersDotCom,5,My wife and I have been watching this show together every night since we realized it was on Amazon Prime. It pretty much has made my subscription pay for itself. Mike is hilarious and the show is educational.
B001NJQ1YQ,Amazon Customer,5,Ka-boom just about says it all. This is a series that has remained popular for something like 15 or 16 seasons. I don't know about anyone else but I come back for the ka-booms. I also enjoy the other things too because they do with attention to detail and wit.
B001NJQ1YQ,Bill Austin,4,Good subject mater and presentation.  The show has always been a favorite of mine.  I can recommend it to everyone.
B001NJQ1YQ,R.L. Black,5,Husband and sons have watched many seasons and really enjoy them all.  We've all learned alot from the mythbusters.  Highly recommend.
B001O3COHY,Michael,5,These episodes were a treat. If you love exploring the deep and even more so the preditors that live there than this is for you. Educational
B001ODQA4C,Amazon Customer,5,The situation that this show presents are not typical and holds you attention.  The format of the stories are believable and the actors do a very good job.  I am looking for to watching the reat of the seasons.
B001ODQA4C,Amazon Customer "Home Daddy",4,This is a nice Canadian show. Very good ensemble cast carry the NCIS/CSI like show.  Fans of BSG & other Syfi channel shows will see some familiar guest stars through out the seasons.I think the show gets better as the seasons go because you like the Team.
B001ODQA4C,Amy S. Johnson "Just Me",5,This is an exciting and fun show. Not all the episodes aired in the United States  so it was fun to see the ones that only aired in Canada. I have both seasons of the show and cannot wait for the 3rd season to be released.
B001ODQA4C,Babbs,5,action packed and true to life and a great tribute to police officers anywhere.  Sorry it ended after so few seasons.
B001ODQA4C,ChristyB,5,This one of the best programs I have ever seen.  It is family friendly with no swearing and no sex scenes.  It's extremely interesting seeing inside the SRU and seeing how they solve the cases.  I only wish it was more than 5 seasons.  Thank you Amazon Prime for offering this program. Would love to see more Canadian produced programs -- they seem to have it together better than the US.
B001ODQA4C,D. Greene "pooh",5,Awesome show.  Season two continues to deliver everything that makes this show so great. I Highly recommend this show to Flashpoint lovers.
B001ODQA4C,Dr J,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Season 2 videos.  Too few episodes is my only complaint.  It is well written and well acted.
B001ODQA4C,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,awesome.  sexy men and smart tough good looking woman.  story line fast and intelligent .  different locales all of the time i like.  music good.  keep em coming.
B001ODQA4C,Ruth M. Capolino "scooter",5,I'm mesmerized by this series---just can't get enough of it.The characters are what make it----they are so believable!Great job!!
B001ODQA4C,sharon kemm,5,each episode in the series makes you want to see more. the cast and the entire show are well-worth watching.
B001ODQA4C,Sunni,5,Each episode is a story that is very true in today's world of growing violence and many times dealing with mentally ill criminals or mentally ill persons who have been hurt due to the results of violent crime. I love the show. There is great humanity among this featured special police unit.
B001ODQA4C,The Librarian,5,Really like this show. It as the same kind of draw you in feel as other shows like the original CSI. You kinda get to know the characters and grow with them.
B001OEEKU2,J. D. Nelson "JD Nelson",5,I'm always on the lookout for interesting romantic comedies and this movie turned out to fit the bill. Great acting and passionate love scenes made this one better than expected.
B001OEEKU2,Jorge Gomez,2,Actuallly didn't finish watching it. Was not engaging enough. Slow moving and the romantic appeal was not evident well into the movie.
B001OHU9VS,Joyce,5,My husband and I continued to enjoy this series.  The husband (coach) and wife (school principal/counselor) played strong role models for the many teenagers as they all struggled through various real-life situations.  The only disappointing aspect of the series was the on-going sexual encounters that began during the middle school years of various students.
B001OHU9VS,Robyn Talbott "&#34;VirtuallyConnected2U",5,I loved this show so much I couldn't wait to finish it.  I devoured each season and when I got to the end.  I watched Season 1 all over again because by that time I was in love with each and every character.
B001OHU9VS,S. Mansfield,5,I simply cannot say enough good things about this program.  Exciting.  Riveting.  Great characters and an interesting plot with each episode.  One of my all time favorites.
B001PN63PC,Erica L. Jablonsky,4,I like Joaquin. Movie wasn't like the most magical movie ever but worth watching. Maybe it should have been called 1.5 lovers ha.
B001QDKK3W,Amazon Customer "Carolyn",5,Loved this show. I hate that it was cancelled. I like the shows theme and the smart people. All the members are smart. I love it. No stupid-b----e style.
B001QDKK3W,Amazon Customer "curling acs",5,I find this show entertaining but at the same time offers it some very interesting ideas regarding identifying people who are lying.  Very seldom does a TV show make me do research into a topic but this one does.
B001QDKK3W,bob,5,Always twisting plots and am no on Season 3 and wish there were more in the can so that I could watch all of them....................
B001QDKK3W,Cathy P.,5,I wish this show hadn't gotten dropped because its an awesome and smart show. Apparently this is based on a real guy who wrote a book about being able to recognize whether people are lying by their facial expressions and body language and there is a website to check out as well. I like movies and shows based on something real. Excellently executed and the actor they got to play the main character is brilliant.
B001QDKK3W,DAE,5,I LOVE THE SHOW!!!! The characters are well-developed and the premise of the show is a refreshingly new look at crime shows.
B001QDKK3W,Darlene,5,I have always loved Tim Roth and think he does a great job in this series.  This is such an extraordinary topic!  I don't know if there is scientific evidence to back up the theory around which the show revolves but suspect there is.  I will be looking into it a bit deeper.  I just don't understand why it only ran 3 seasons. I guess mainstream America didn't get it but I love it!!
B001QDKK3W,D Dawg,5,From this show I am learning how to read micro expressions this is a very interesting study and like many others I am choosing to learn threw watching tv rather than reading.
B001QDKK3W,Deanna R Taylor,5,New subject matter leaving some new series in the dust.  Interesting concept but sure someone can master it.  Worth your time.
B001QDKK3W,Diana Strole,5,Very interestng show.  Each episode is another story and they are all really good.Don't know if body language really tells whether or not you are lying but it sure makes it interesting!
B001QDKK3W,D. R. Roberts,5,Lie to Me: Season One Dvds. Good Delivery Time. Great Drama series.My husband wanted to see this after seeing two of the shows and we loved it!Amazon had great low prices and DVD in Perfect condition!
B001QDKK3W,Edward Vanzo,4,A very new and good &#34;gimmick&#34; for a story.  It is hard to imagine how the series can keep up the same interesting slant.  However I am willing and eager to continue watching.  Tim Roth is one of the best actors around.
B001QDKK3W,E. Lillian Creveling,5,I love this series even thought Mr Lightman is an unusual man. It has a mild sense of humor. I enjoy how the truth is uncovered with their skills of face reading. I would definitely recommend this series.
B001QDKK3W,H. Jeanne Rockwell,5,Love this show~~  I'm sorry to note that there only seems to be 3 seasons.  Makes me curious as to why it wasn't continued.
B001QDKK3W,Jenny Crusie Smith,5,This show is great: wonderful cast and tight scripts and a really intriguing premise.  Each show stands on its own but also arcs the characters over the full season.  Well worth watching.
B001QDKK3W,j,2,I like Tim Roth as an actor but in this series his character is not as engaging as it should be for someone of his talents. There is nothing to connect on the human level - no warmth or even cold humor.
B001QDKK3W,Jo Ann Massaro,5,I am hooked not only on this series but on the technology. I will never look at some ones' face the same way again. Looking down is a sign of lying while looking down and to the side is shame. I would love to learn more about the art/science of mini expressions. The acting in this series is superb and the casting perfect. A must watch.
B001QDKK3W,Kindle Customer "Mex Lover",5,I think the acting is brilliant....and the characters they play are interesting. This is more of a phsycological detective show which never shows graphic viiolence...it leaves a lot for the imagination and keeps you wondering. I think the Sherlock series was better but this one comes close...
B001QDKK3W,Kirk,4,Started watching the show when it first came out... was amazed then with the focused on habits of people to see if a person is telling the truth of not.
B001QDKK3W,Kizmet64,4,I like this show.  The lead character kinda gives you the willies by staring at people but I like the show.
B001QDKK3W,Kobe 519 "Genevieve Cherry-Sours",5,I love this show!!! My husband is ex cop and has taught me a lot about &#34;reading&#34; people and I love how the character in the show calls people out on their deception.
B001QDKK3W,lpearson,5,Fantastic show. I love it and can't wait to watch the other seasons. Studying minute facial expressions to acknowledge lying is amazing.
B001QDKK3W,Lynnie "Ausblonde",5,Loved it from the first episode and could not wait for the DVD to be released so I could watch the episodes over and over.  It is just that good.  I am hanging out for more as the first Season only had thirteen episodes.  I believe it has now been definitely picked up and therefore can look forward to many more.  Do yourself a favour and watch it you will not be disappointed.
B001QDKK3W,Marilyn M. Green,5,I didn't watch the original TV program on Fox so I enjoyed watching the episodes on my Kindle. This is a well written and well acted drama. Facial and voice cues are used to determine if someone is lying. Cases involve a variety of situations so it is not repetitive. The mix of work and family in the show is enjoyable to watch. I would recommend Lie to Me to anyone who likes crime dramas. I realize that Fox cancelled Lie to Me due to low ratings. I don't remember seeing ads for the show so I wonder if they promoted it well enough.
B001QDKK3W,peter nisius,4,Probably the best scripted television show that is available through Amazon prime. Provides insight into how people can and do communicate either truthfully or with deception. The acting is good.
B001QDKK3W,Robyn Talbott "&#34;VirtuallyConnected2U",5,Not sure why this show wasn't renewed after 3 seasons. I love the action and suspense and look into deception.
B001QDKK3W,Sam,5,This is such a great show I can hardly put my kindle down. The actors are the best. I am so glad season. 2 & 3 r on prime also
B001QDKK3W,sharon kemm,5,why isn't this on regular television or directv? the lightman company and its cast keep you watching and you want more.
B001QDKK3W,Sjc62,4,I just happened on this series as recommended for me by Amazon. And I'm glad I did. I don't know if their premises are true but the actors really make you believe they are. Worth watching.
B001QDKK3W,S. Lee "waterwoman39",5,Still fascinated at the notion of reading expressions of the minutest display.  The stories are engaging and touching when people are really faced for what they are doing.
B001QDKK3W,southerntothecore "richard",5,I marvel at the clever scripts. I marvel at the assemblage visuals to support the inventive scripts. I marvel at the actors that pull this off. The film editor must be a genius to intertwine all the pieces in to a cohesive story line. BRAVO! Making all the pieces fit into the premise of this inspired &#34;who done the bad deed&#34; is astonishing to me. Body language and facial clues expose everyone to scrutiny. This is the most &#34;unique&#34; show I've seen in years. pat on the back to all .. and five stars from me.. to you...
B001QDKK3W,Suzanne Fisher,5,Sorry it ended. Enjoyed it very much. The actors and writers were very entertaining. Wish there was another season to see.
B001QDKK3W,Terrijean,4,Interesting premise still used by psychology and law enforcement. Well done by  this group of actors...and personal stories interwoven. Fun to watch!
B001QDT85I,Citizen John,2,I've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works.  That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved.  But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it's hard on the eyes.
B001QDT85I,Success,4,It's a pretty good program. It is reenacted but still very good. I enjoyed it. I think you will too.
B001R2NP66,gator,3,Even the Mystery Science cast can't make this movie worth watching. It has got to be one of the worst ever.
B001R2NP66,Virginia Yank,2,Stopped 15 minutes into the movie.  This movie wasn't so bad as it was irratating. The quips from the Satellite of Love crew didn't make up for it.  There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment.
B001R2XQ8S,C. G. Porcaro "drivec",5,This film has a whole lot of nothing going on. Thank goodness that the MST3K crew could take care of all this nothingness with their riffing! A must watch MST3K and not a bad place to start either.
B001R4Q6A6,C. G. Porcaro "drivec",5,This is my #2 favorite MST3K episode. Be prepared for 80s references - these make it hard to be a perfect film for everyone. The acting is just terrible and the storyline full of plot holes - excellent MST3K fodder.
B001R68VPC,dokolady "dokolady",5,I have been a big fan of MST 3000 for years.  It is absolutely brainless and perfectly snarky.  A great time-waster!
B001R68VPC,Virginia Yank,3,Maybe I've outgrown MST 3000 but I didn't find this very funny.  The movie was bad but it didn't offer enough faults give the crew something to work with.
B001RPORJ2,M,3,It was not too bad but there was never a reason for why that happened to the family. I was looking for a complete story line and this movie fell short of that.
B001SE07JG,Ann,5,Love to watch it.  Kinda surreal syfy feel to it.  The major actors are great!  Really like it.  Very action packed.
B001SE07JG,Gerold Ransom "G Mon'e",4,This I think was a good enough show just the fact that it was canceled after about 2 seasons sucks
B001SE07JG,libbylab,4,You have to like hi tech related plots as this storyline depends on that genre.  I am an old electrical engineer so that's &#34;down my alley&#34;.  I have liked each episode but  not always folled all  of the plot of all of them.
B001SE07JG,Mom of an ultimate frisbee geek,4,I only watched this because of Josh Whedon.  I've seen only three episodes It was Ok and entertaining. Haven't grown attached to any of the &#34;Dolls&#34; yet
B001SE07JG,Richard "Fun_to_know",4,overall this is a show I can watch in weekly increments. Halfway through season one the storyline began to blend into each episode as if they wrtier were running out of creative idea's for this theme but I am looking forward to season 2
B001SE07JG,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",4,the title put me off but after watching the first show i was hooked.  it's got good story lines and a good cast.
B001SE1FAG,J. Kinzie "JK1NZ1E",5,It was great to go back and see Coach and Tyson where they started. This is a great season and very entertaining!
B001SE1FAG,mlsigner "mlsigner",5,If nothing else we get to learn how to pronounce the season from Jeff.  I like the ability to learn of the country and culture of the area the survivors have entered.
B001SRN6IW,1443giggles,5,I love this move and Julie Roberts and Danzel Washington are some of my favorite actors.  I am glad I purchased this movie.
B001SRN6IW,Anthony P. Olson,3,Perhaps not the best book to adapt into a movie.  Seemed choppy and didn't work well.  I like many movie adaptations but in this case I'd say the book is about 10x more entertaining.
B001TNVEKC,Amazon Customer "EAJ",3,took too long to get into the story line. kept wanting to just shut it off.  by the end it was okay. I don't recommend it.
B001U7TJXQ,926 Daytripper "926daytripper",5,One of the very best shows on TV.  It is just amazing the footage of the wrecks. I can not wait until the next series.
B001U7TJXQ,Lurch,5,This is great to see what is right under you (if you are on a boat that is) and not even know it a great show and fun.  You learn and laugh a great mix
B001U7TJXQ,Mark C,5,I have only watched the first 5 or 6 episodes of the show but I'm already hooked. The storylines are compelling and its a great way to look at history from a modern perspective.
B001U7TJXQ,Michael L. Lowenstein,3,The show had very good video streaming I found the show a little long without any excitement. I guess I was hoping for that buried treasure of gold .
B001U7TJXQ,Thanks I Needed That,5,I have always enjoyed this program.  I mostly like the ide of finding treasure in some tropical sea or location.
B001UI8KV2,Redbanks,5,This is a terrific movie for those who enjoy the surprise endings that were there the whole time.  Naturally complex but no false holes.  It unfolds perfectly.  French with English subtitles (with the occasional English speaking exchanges).  Every member of the cast deliver awesome performances.  Stylish production with lavish settings and locations.  Another gem for Jean Dujardin (OSS 177)...
B001UO82K0,Mary paushel,5,Loved being able to watch these &#34;crazy&#34; pageant moms again. Very glad I bought it. I want to buy every episode.
B001UPP900,Jennifer M. Lake "Book Bunny",5,Good effects and storyline. Suspenseful images and story. This is where Chris Egan got his name. I can't imagine this was cancelled after only half of a season.
B001UPP900,Paul Medus "thought  passion  action",5,To see the signs in one's life all one need do is look.  Have you seen yours today?
B001UUAGRQ,Frankie D,3,Not a fan of this series. It has its moments and can be funny and has good drama and action at times.  Charactors are weird and crazy. The perso I got it for loves this series and really enjoyed it. So I am glad my friend is happy.  One of his favorite series. I can do without it. Take it or leave it.
B001UUAGRQ,Kuhn Rich,4,my life is not so bad compared to tommys life. i realize that is a dramady. his house is the constant in his life keeping him sane (kind of).
B001V52RZE,Bob,4,My kids love this show.  All the stories they tell and the unique characters.  It's great fun for my toddlers.
B001V52RZE,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",4,The Dancing is cute and the use of imaginations keeps it interesting. My son replies &#34;hear my tummy&#34; when I ask him if he wants a snack.
B001V52RZE,kitk85816,5,Another enjoyed season of show with granddaughter.  The adventures and Learning that are in this show are educating and dancing after are fun for granddaughter to do
B001V52RZE,Rosanne Dutzer,5,I enjoy watching the Backyardigans with my grandson.  These shows are very entertaining and he loves to sing and dance with the characters!
B001V52RZE,Selena,2,Surprisingly enough this show did not hold the attention of my two little ones. If a show is dull they move on within 5 minutes...and that's what they did. I however love this show!
B001V58C4O,Alex Ross,4,This is serious...realy is a good show.  My son & I still enjoy it.i will watch it again & again.
B001V58C4O,Amazon Customer,5,I dont get it but my girl loves it and its clean entertainment for young kids. She loves the &#34;whats gonna work? teamwork&#34; song which actually inspires her to work with others to get tasks done and I love that.
B001V58C4O,Amazon Customer "Renaissance Man",5,Great on teamwork and geography.  It's actually tolerable for viewing with children. Better than the majority of pap that's out there.
B001V58C4O,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",5,Easy to follow and learn about all kinds of animals. My 3 year old learned &#34;teamwork&#34; from watching the wonder pets.
B001V58C4O,Christine Vogelsang,5,Wonder pets is great for young children.  It is entertaining and teaches kindness and the importance of helping others.  Also teaches children some portant facts about animals highlighted in each episode.
B001V58C4O,Cortney Yonker,5,My daughter loves this show. I watch young kids during the day and love that they can enjoy this show and learn good healthy lessons from the show at the same time.
B001V58C4O,Mieshka,4,This show is cute.  My daughter loved it when she was 1 to 3 years old and still asks for it occasionally now at 5.5.  The characters are cute.  Most kids adore animals of any kind and there are plenty with cute rescues...only thing for parents is the singing can be kind of annoying sometimes.  Just  let it in though.  Eeventually you'll be humming and singing the theme song all the time...or it will just play on a continuous reel in your mind while you're trying to fall asleep or typing a review on amazon!  That's the only catch.
B001V58C4O,Rosanne Dutzer,5,My grandson watches Wonder Pets on my iPad and just loves this show.  He sings along with the characters and just loves animals.
B001V80OP6,Barbara,5,Grandsons love Olivia. I (Granny) also like it. It has good teaching lessons in each episode. Recommend it for young children.
B001V80OP6,bobbi,5,Olivia Season 1 was great for my grandchild. He enjoyed watching it. It held his attention. He likes the characters.
B001V80OP6,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",5,Olivia is a sweet story about a very ambitious girl and her family. I love the fact she is not lazy and is not afraid to daydream then commit to action. This is great for girls or boys.
B001V80OP6,Cindy Flowers,5,My boys love this show. my 3 year old loves the scrapes she gets into and my 2 year old is fascinated by the little bother and the little brother.  This series can keep them quietly entertained for hours.
B001V80OP6,ddrevia,5,We love Olivia. She has such a way about her and it's fun to see how her imagination works. &#128522;
B001V80OP6,John Johnson,5,My son and daughter both love Olivia and hum the theme song all the time. Lots of fun for the whole family...
B001V80OP6,Karin Gaffney,5,I love the imagination and creativity Olivia has.  My 3 year old daughter has a very creative imagination and finds a kindred spirit in this character
B001V80OP6,Kristin L. Weiner,4,My children enjoy the Adventures of Olivia. She's always doing something fun and getting into interesting situations too. Good Show.
B001V80OP6,Lisa M Wiley,4,My girls love Olivia.  I think it's cute.  I would give it 5 stars if it had some educational content.  It is a sweet fun show though.  Olivia does learn life lessons during most of the episodes and I like that a lot.
B001V80OP6,roxy,5,Such a fun show for the kids to watch. It keeps them entertained and teaches them a few things too!
B001V80OP6,vtmama,5,Perfect for ages 4 and up. My 5 year old daughter loves it! Very good-natured and funny without being dumbed down or too flashy. I also don't feel like they're trying to sell anything.
B001V98S2G,Jacqueline Garrett "jackie g",5,i just can't believe they cancelled this show.  it was so groundbreaking and funny.  every episode was new and original.  the writers should win awards.
B001V98S2G,Joe   L. "Joe L.",5,Great show sad to see it get cancelled. Networks nowadays don't take enough risk or time to get a show on track.
B001V98S2G, Leah  "Leah",5,Funniest show on TV Portia de Rossi is outstanding and I LOVE Phil and Lem!
B001V98S2G,Love Amazon,1,Wonderful show if you are an adolescent. If not then find something else to watch. The concept is funny but the show is not.
B001V98S2G,Mary Louise Pivec,5,Laughed hard every episode.  Has to be seen to be believed. This is the final proof that Portia is much funnier than her wife.
B001V98S2G,Spalmer,5,A show that makes it hard to breath!  Watch it more than once to catch the jokes you laughed through the first time.  Such a shame that this very funny show didn't last longer--but well worth watching what was made.
B001V98S2G,suki,5,It's a shame that ABC dumped such a fabulous show it's hilarious it's intelligent writing. The acting is stellar so it's great!!!
B001VT4L7W,Amazon Customer,5,I expected this one set to be a winner and it did not disappoint.  All the great characters and a positive story line each time
B001VT4L7W,Chrystal,5,My 3 yr old loves this show! I like that it is not only entertaining but educational as well. My son can tell me so much about animals it is amazing.
B001VT4L7W,Debra Kittrell,5,Entertaining and educational. My granddaughter loves Diego. We recommend. It seems to capture and keep her attention. Hope you and your kids love it as well.
B001W1Y5RK,Sylvia Evans,5,This was a gift for our adult son who has been a South Park fan ever since it began.  It was on his list so he knew what it would be and was very happy to receive it.
B001Y5913C,Avril Sol,5,Nice middle school or young teen series.
B001Y5913C,Debbie Dillon,4,My grand-daughter loves this shoe. She would watch the same episode over and over if she were able. It's part of Prime.
B001Y5913C,Doc "Doc",5,Well produced series for teen girls and their moms.  Not disrespectful to elders or other kids.  Just a lot of fun.
B001Y5913C,@margaret,5,I would recommend this video for children and teens. I am adult and I enjoyed this tremendously. It was refreshing. No sex or profanity included.
B001Y5913C,Pamala Pickard,5,I love mermaids! It was good to find a TV show featuring them.  The stories are good and the water scenes are beautiful.
B001Y5913C,Raymond Coade,5,I thought this would be another teen age brainless romp. Despite being far from a teenager I began enjoying it and was ready for the next episode when the one I was watching ended.
B001YDZYE4,mr. contrarian,2,I love southern gothic (like Cormac McCarthy's "Suttree") but this film is missing it's only crucial ingredient...truth.  The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped.  Like Bjork's "Dancer In The Dark" it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness.
B002029Q4C,Dave PA,5,The kids love it. Good tv like I remember it as a kid. As a parent it's not tough to watch with them either.
B002029Q4C,I. McKinzie,5,I have really gotten fond of all these Australian TV series !! Can't stop watching this one ! If you like teens ... you will like this series :-)
B002029Q4C,K.V.,5,My daughter can't get enough of H2O. She loves the show an it is family friendly. It seems to keep her attention and I don't have to monitor it for bad issues.
B002029Q4C,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",5,But they missed the boat now making into seasion DVD for USA > Its only on PAL. I want ot buy the DVD season not individual episodes
B002029Q4C,Raymond Coade,5,Season number 2 just as delightful to watch as the first.  Just the right amount of suspense to get to keep coming back.
B0021HAG5E,al,5,think of this as a alien and zombie movie in one.  loads of action and adventure.  with this 2 disk set there is not a whole lot of features to the movie one of them is at comic con with stars from the movie there.
B0021HAG5E,fuzzy123,3,A steam punk dirty dozen vs. machinemade mutant zombies.The production values of this film are excelent. It fully realises the grity feel of a decaying future fueled by steam boilers.Makeup is also good.  The spear armed mech-zombies realy work.Get out the popcorn and enjoy!
B0021HAG5E,jeri,3,wasnt a bad movie but not the one i thought it was. but i will watch it again i'm sure.
B0021Y8RW6,Angela,4,I am glad that I listened to the other reviews for season one.  Season one does start off a bit slow but as you get entangled in the show and characters it is absolutely addicting.  I loved each episode and after season one it just gets funnier and funnier!  Definitely  continue watching even if you aren't hooked by the first few episodes... it's worth it! : )
B0021Y8RW6,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,Amy Poehler  shines in this series about the small town ups and downs in the department of Parks and Gardens.Quirky characters add to the fun in the series.Will watch more seasons. Relaxing and fun!
B0021Y8RW6,Diana De Avila "MS Gkygrl",5,My partner is a Political Science Professor and watching Parks & Recreation with her has been wonderful to help understand some of the little innuendo that comes with understanding a comedy dealing with local government.  There are some issues that are so politically incorrect that you'll just have to laugh.  I've loved this series and have them DVR'ed and watch them over and over.  I look forward to the actual release of the DVD (which I have pre-ordered) so that I can watch the episodes without commercial interruption.The characters are extremely funny and stereotypical to what you might imagine a government worker to be like.  Lines like:"What I can accomplish in government can actually be measured" (after one of the characters is commended for lowering a speed bump two inches).The humor can be dry at times (love it) and it brings out a wonderful side of Amy Poehler[...]A mockumentary series at it's best!
B0021Y8RW6,Dr J,2,I thought the plots were weak and the &#34;humor&#34; was not very funny.  The actors did a good job but it didn't seem that they had much to work with.
B0021Y8RW6,g00se9,4,This show has so many funny characters that you have to find at least one thing you like about it.
B0021Y8RW6,joe,4,Remember that The Office wasn't that good when it first came on but it gets way Better! That's the same with this show!
B0021Y8RW6,Richard Newton,4,This has always been one of my favorite shows. It's hard to pick any season as being better than another.
B00252MNWY,Nancy E. Gallagher,5,I didn't watch this on tv when it first came out. So I had the joy of gorging on a whole season at once.  This was my bedtime tv for weeks.  I like it.
B00252MNWY,sam,5,I am a fanof this police series.  It is one of the best I have ever seen with it real life portrayl of police officer and criminals.Excellent viewing.
B00252MNWY,S. Gluck,5,Best cop show since &#34;Police Story&#34; complex characters acted by a great ensemble cast. A real shame TNT cancelled it. Ann Biderman the shows creator is terrific. Fortunately her new show &#34;Ray Donovan &#34; on ShowtimeContinues to show she has great stories to tell
B00252MNWY,Webster68,5,Purchased the first episode of the first season not knowing what to expect.  Ended up purchasing all 5 seasons as we enjoyed each episode of each season.  See my reviews on the other seasons to help you decide if the show is worth purchasing.  Enjoy!
B0025Z8G4K,Agramma,5,I don't understand why the network decided to dump this series.  I found it interesting and humorous.  The probably dumped it to keep up with the other networks' stupid programming qualities.  TV is deteriorating  a little more every year.  Hard to find anything really good on TV anymore.
B0025Z8G4K,Amazon Customer "Home Daddy",3,This was an good cop show.  It did not deserve the quick pull the network gave it.  It was fun.  Sometimes it tried just a bit too hard to be funny and edge but it worked.  It was a good break at a time when there were 4 Law & Orders on TV.  If you get super bored on the treadmill I look for shows to pass the time.
B0025Z8G4K,Avril Sol,5,Loved the show and its quirkiness.  Too bad it didn't last long. I guess the lead actor was too busy doing &#34;The Avengers&#34; movie. ...
B0025Z8G4K,B. Slack,5,Really well developed characters.Funny.Intelligently written.Excellent cross-genre blend of comedy and cop shop.This is another one of those great shows that makes you wonder what is going through programming executives minds when they cancel shows like this.
B0025Z8G4K,cathy piontkowski,5,I really thought this was great.  It was Unusual that I like a cop show.EXCELLENT!!  why oh why did it stop.
B0025Z8G4K,Chris Crawford,2,This is one of those shows that needs to grow on you. So far it hasn't found any arable land here. I'm being patient and maybe somebody will sprinkle me with fertilizer in the future.
B0025Z8G4K,Colleen,2,This series is just alright. The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright. It isnt overly funny and it isn't real serious- it is sort of in the middle. I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I wouldn't pay more than the membership to watch it .
B0025Z8G4K,cynthia,5,This series was a great show/series!  I find it hard to believe it got cancelled after only 1 season.  It was not shown or promoted because it is much better than shows that have made it for years.  The humor is fabulous...very similar to the M.A.S. H. television series.  The major networks all want criminal minds and csi type shows...we loose  with this all the same philosophy.  I wish they would make more seasons to THE UNUSUALS!  Maybe Netflix or Amazon will make their own series of this show!
B0025Z8G4K,Diverboston,4,The dispatcher cracks me up all the time. Also . Some kind here and there are hilarious and they say it so matter of fact that I have to rewind the show to see if I didn't dream it. Why do they always cancel the good tv shows that are funny and good? This is a funny and entertaining show where cops actually smile - not like Law and Order where everybody needs to exercise their zygomatics.
B0025Z8G4K,dvdjhll,4,Started out pretty good for a cop drama. Got a little formulaic toward the end. Really should have been given a second season to see if it could have gotten its feet under it. Definitely worth watching.
B0025Z8G4K,egf,5,Exciting and great rapport between Jeremy and Amber. This series was on TV for only a year which was a shame because it was well done.
B0025Z8G4K,E. Lillian Creveling,5,This also is only one season but it's a very delightful series. The humor was funny. You should see it.
B0025Z8G4K,gizzy,4,It was pretty good. I'll definitely watch the other episodes. Especially enjoyed Jeremy Renner. He's a pretty good actor and does a lot with his various roles..
B0025Z8G4K,G. L. Oneal,5,Too bad this did not last. Everyone needs to keep up with these surveys so that maybe we can keep shows like this from going away
B0025Z8G4K,James A. Moore "Jim",3,Maybe detective series got overdone about this time. There's nothing really special about this one. It's OK. Not much more.
B0025Z8G4K,Judy Kazlauskis "JudyK",4,Good to see a cop show with a sense of humor treated like every day life (which it probably is).
B0025Z8G4K,Kbaby59,5,I had never heard of this show till i saw it on prime.  I thought it was wonderful.  It has great characters and plots with really good comedy relief.
B0025Z8G4K,K. D. Fortune "Ken Fortune",5,Renner in a funny cop tv show!! How did it get droppedafter only two seasons?? Gotta see it if you like off beathumor!
B0025Z8G4K,Laval A. Thibodeau "mr.t.",4,edgy characters mixed with a dash of quick witted dialogue makes for a good series. Only wish there was more to come.
B0025Z8G4K,Lolo,5,It is a dramady (drama with comedy mixed in).  It is good that they try the make the characters real with  normal.  Not like super cops with no character defects.
B0025Z8G4K,LR,5,I was skeptical about this show after reading that it was reminiscent of M*A*S*H.  It has it's own personality but with that special touch that M*A*S*H had.  A wonderful cast with crazy stories and personalities I'd love to see again and again!  It's painful to know that this is the only season but it's worth watching time and again.  And I will continue to watch it as long as it's available!
B0025Z8G4K,Mam,4,We are just starting the series good but so far it has been very interesting.  I am starting to get to know the people but the title is so weird I do not quite get it.
B0025Z8G4K,mrs natural,4,We started watching this when there was really nothing on regular tv to watch and it is really pretty good. I never heard of this series but we have come across several series on Amazon that we never heard of which were Ok to watch.
B0025Z8G4K,Nana C,5,It is a shame that it was only one season.  It was  quirky and interesting.  would like to see more of it.
B0025Z8G4K,Nikki,4,This is a great show. I wish I had known about it when it was on TV. I really like Renner as an actor and he does an awesome job in this role. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend. Shame it didn't have more than one season.
B0025Z8G4K,Pam Swinson,5,awesome i liked all of the actors in this series. I wish they had continued this show for many for years than it aired.  Maybe they can bring it back.
B0025Z8G4K,Pat Babcock,5,I loved this series so much that I had to watch back to back episodes until I saw them all. There's a great mix of comedy and drama. I wish there were more episodes to watch.
B0025Z8G4K,Paula,5,It was a good show. A little over the top but interesting.Good actors and good story plot.sorry it's over bye
B0025Z8G4K,Pflugerville Pete "Amiable Zany",4,I liked it when it was on air.  I would have liked to seen where it went as the show went on.
B0025Z8G4K,reader,5,This deserved a longer run on Network TV but was cancelled by ABC wayu too quickly. Thoroughly superior series with enjoyable comedy drama. Leaves you wanting much more.
B0025Z8G4K,Robert Fischer "Alone At the Alter",5,I like the group of misfit characters they have assembled as NY police detectives. The stories are good and the characters interact very well with each other. I wish there were more than one season to watch.
B0025Z8G4K,Sashin,5,Great tv show. Didn't watch it when it was on tv.  Inaptly named and poorly described was the problem.  Now Renner is a big movie star and I bet those white collars are kicking themselves.  Many unresolved issues at the series end. Worth watching.
B0025Z8G4K,Seattle Reader,5,This is the best cop series I have ever seen. The characters as so original. The stories are are so imaginative and not derivative like so many cop shows.  I hated it when I realized I was watching the last episode.
B0025Z8G4K,sharon kemm,5,interesting- good cop show. wanted to see more. each character was fully developed and story line credible. will they make any more episodes?
B0025Z8G4K,Sinohey "scribe",4,Attractive protagonists who play well off each other. Lead actors (Renner & Tamblyn) are sympathetic and supported by a varied and interesting group of characters who contrast nicely with each other. But nothing is 'unusual' about them except some odd behaviors. Slightly reminiscent of 'Barney Miller'. Entertaining light drama with some  comedy mixed in for good balance. Sadly the series was not renewed after 2009.
B0025Z8G4K,Susan Duffy,4,I love watching police and detective show and this is a good one to watch.  The story line keeps a good pace and the actors do a good job.
B0025Z8G4K,Tamara J. Christian,5,I really am enjoying this series. Too bad it was cancelled.  It is quirky and fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously but still has action in it.
B0025Z8G4K,Terri,5,I really enjoyed the series. The characters were interesting and the relationships had rapport. Would really like to see more of this series.
B0025Z8G4K,THE G,4,Somehow I did not become aware of this show until recently and I am enjoying the first season and the show offers some twists and turns.
B0025Z8G4K,Value Shopper Pensacola,5,I enjoyed watching this series while it was on prime instant video but is not anymore and I don't care to purchase the remaining episodes I didn't get to watch.
B0025Z8G4K,Vulcanicus,5,I really liked this series and am so sorry it did not get a fan base to support it! The characters were all interesting and all aspects of the plots were great! Good music and good humor to leaven some the more serious plots in the first season. I would recommend it to anyone!
B00266MPF4,Joe   L. "Joe L.",5,Always impressed. It is very fascinating and educational. This show is almost the Bill Nye of the twentieth century. FILLER.
B00266MPF4,Kathleen Rowland,1,This show is weird.  They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles.  Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose.
B00266MPF4,Sherri in Georgia,5,My son introduced me to this show and I must say that I find it quite fasinating.  I have learned a lot about science and been reminded of things long forgotten from school days.  The boys of course love the &#34;big booms&#34; associated with many of the experiments and projects on the shows.  This is fun for our family to watch together.
B0026QMYN2,Gerald Harris,5,this set of dvd's was a gift for a friend overseas and I sure they are going to be upset to learn the series was cancelled
B0026QMYN2,Jen Sites,5,I had forgotten how much I had love this show. I have a good selection of actors and actresses. I won't recommend this for young children. There is some violence and language.
B0026QMYN2,J. Ligon "JimL",5,I now own the entire series and have not been disappointed with any of the sets. Well worth the purchase price.
B0026QMYN2,K. Marlow "Kat",5,Arrived before pre-determined time and in the condition promised great service did not have any issues with product or retailer
B0026QMYN2,M. McMann "freelance writer",5,I love In Plain Sight! This offbeat series is one that I will order as long as it is on television.
B0026QMYN2,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",5,Mary Shepherd would hate being called a heroine.  She does her job in a no nonsense manner while juggling and caring for her wildly dysfunctional family. This is a not-to-be-missed series.
B0026QMYN2,Nedra Ann Schott,5,Loved the first season so now I'm loving the second one too.  Mary and Marshall pop off each other so well.
B002962RKE,CareTaker,5,Ordered the Glee first season and love every minute of it. I am not a broadway song and dance guy but the clever fusion of music and story line in Glee makes it compelling TV. Give the show a chance and it will grow on you. Second season has also started off with a bang.
B002962RKE,DonnaSays "Amazon makes my Life easy!",5,Scooby-Doo's Original Mysteries...Glee: The Complete First Season...just so happy love it own all the seasons...a real pick me up series!~
B002962RKE,Douglas W. Fielder,5,This series is well worth watching.  There are many talented cast members and the music is the best.  Try it!
B002962RKE,Frankie D,5,The only season of Glee worth watching is the first. Good start to a show. The show was really good. Watch the the other seasons and you will see how bad this show sucks now. This isa very funny show. If you like Glee get this.
B002962RKE,george lopez,5,I loved this sooooo much that I just recently purchased it on blu-ray! I am a Gleek through and through!
B002962RKE,Jacqueline A. Conney-forero "jaqtwo",5,Love love love this show.  Love the dancing and singing and the comedy and drama.  It is a great show
B002962RKE,Kaitlyn,4,I love the singing and dancing. I couldn't stop watching it. I also got my mom hooked on it. Over all its a masterpiece!
B002962RKE,Lady Raven RAVE!,5,I got into glee late and loving the show its great to watch with the family and sign along to the songs you know. Love their performance at the regional finals. Hope it continues to flow as well as it has through out the season. I love when they sing Journey's songs awesome.
B002962RKE,LaVonne Hauwiller,4,We are enjoying the shows without any commercials.I do wish Emma would have married will instead of the dentist Carl...
B002962RKE,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,A refreshing unique show that shows how life is for high schoolers in a little town in Ohio who are in a Glee Club. The characters-both students and teachers will make you see life differently and make you laugh and be sympathetic to a character within moments of each other.
B002962RKE,M. French,1,I don't like this show. I tried it but not worth my time. I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing.
B002962RKE,Michael F. Louis "MFL",4,It is one of the best programs on TV.  I understand that one has to have diversity and that nothing is all peaches and cream but the abject curt rudeness of Jane Lynch is intolerable.
B002962RKE,Mystery person,5,Thought this show was about high school kids so didn't watch it... But the grandkids got me into it because of all the show tunes they sang and they thought Lea Michele was such a great singer..so started watching it every week.
B002962RKE,Nicole Lewis,5,cory is so good and I miss him. glee is not the same without him but seeing them form the beginning is awsome
B002962RKE,Pat,5,I had no idea what I was missing when I didn't include Glee in my shows to watch.  I am making up for lost time and catching up on it now.  The characters are so well played and I am a big fan of anything that includes music and dancing.I highly recommend it as a &#34;must&#34; show to watch.
B002962RKE,Randy S. Milliron "Randune23",5,I never started watching the show but with Amazon prime I was able to watch when I could. I really like the show. You quickly identify with certain characters and loathe others. But the singing is AMAZING!!!!
B002962RKE,Robert Hankins,5,Interesting show that broke the mold on musical comedy on Television.  Enjoyed the singing and glad that singers with some talent were chosen.
B0029Z0QVM,Wilfred J. Milton "&#34;wordsmith&#34;",1,Cheap video game quality animation even in HD format. The purchase of this series was a waste of money and time!
B002A493NY,catthief,5,Foyles War is brilliant.  The characters are great.  The history is real.  Truly a realistic view of the great generation.
B002A493NY,Elizabeth Brancato,4,What more need be said?  Michael Kitchen.  This series continues all that was great in the previous four series and moves closer to the end of the war.
B002A493NY,Grandma,5,Another outstanding detective period series on BBC. The pacing is just right for the contemplative detective buff. The plots are varied and the actors have managed to give weight and verisimilitude to their parts. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B002A493NY,G. Rhen,5,Is it a surprise that allies who should have been friendly to each other had elements on both sides that didn't like each other at all?  This is evident in the early seasons of Foyle's War as Foyle solves the crimes during the American Occupation.  The idea that the Americans and English were all devoted buddies was basic WWII propaganda and the dialogue of this show does not support that concept.  The fact that Roosevelt showed a preference for Stalin over Churchill and that Obama returned a Churchill bust that had been displayed in the White House for about half a century is an indication of the continuing distaste a reactionary element of our population still holds for our English brothers.
B002A493NY,kathleen capela,5,i really enjoyed this entire series and i hope that they have more episodes and seasons to come hoping for more is a great show
B002A493NY,KTL,4,An entertaining slooth series of historical importance. This show gives a sense of what England's people went through during the war while weaving in murder mysteries in the story.
B002A493NY,Lilly D,5,Foyles war is absolutely worth watching. British drama is number one and this series is no exception. I can not wait for the new series to begin and hope PBS shows it.
B002A493NY,Marion M. Giuffria "Marion6",5,Foyle never fails to deliver a good story skilfully done.  the characters well done and the settinigs marvelously recreated. Bravo
B002A493NY,MaxJ,5,The same comments apply as stated before in my review of series 3.  The series was excellent without a doubt
B002A493NY,M. Webster "None",5,I just found this series and am enjoying it very much.  You have to like the British mysteries to enjoy this.
B002A493NY,Nancy Gambrell,5,Foyle's War is wonderful i love all the story lines. I'm fix to start watching the last two seasons and I have love each episode. Will miss it when I done.
B002A493NY,Nancy G. Hutchison "addicted to mysteries",5,This is an awesome series; I recommend it to everyone.  Series 6 is as good as all the previous 5.  Great plot and greatacting.  Don't miss this.
B002A493NY,Romona Burton,5,All episodes were excellent and entertaining. Acting was great.every episodes. Well written well acted. Best series in a long time.
B002A493NY,Stanley Cook,5,season six and final season was as good as all the rest. I'm sorry that there were not more. Well worth your time to watch all right from the start.
B002A493NY,Terri,5,This series is one we will enjoy watching over again and again. The characters are so nicely developed and the story is so poignant
B002A493NY,The Gigi,5,As usual Michael Kitchen is fantastic as the reserved and observent Christopher Foyle.  As we see so much more than the war is going on...it hasn't changed much what with the racketeering that went on through the Iraq war...oh yes it wasn't called that...but much the same anyway.  Sam Stewart as always a good counter balance to Foyles quiet reserved manner.
B002AB1PZQ,Elizabeth A Gonzalez,3,It's a dumb show but it does have some funny moments... I got it for the kids and they seemed to enjoy it.
B002AB1PZQ,mari franks,5,Nothing like cracking up to these two. Their antics and banter with each other will have you laughing till you cry.
B002AL4A4E,Amazon Customer,4,My little girls absolutely Love Ni Hao Ki. They both learn so much. I love the lessons she teaches especially when it comes to ren tu.
B002AL4A4E,Jennifer D. Williams,5,My son is 5 years old and loves this show.  It is educational and teaches great social skills!! Clean and fun!
B002AL4A4E,Jon O "Health Care Worker",4,A great show to teach kids about there emotions. Teaches them how to treat there friends. We are big nick jr fans
B002AL4A4E,Kerry,5,I'm a nanny of a 9 month old am a 2 year old this show peaks both of their interest.
B002AL4A4E,K. Leach,4,The kids enjoy it and it has moments of some educational material.
B002AL4A4E,Mo.C,4,My daughter and I watch this show often and I must say it is equal to watching Dora to learn some spanish. I enjoy learning the Chinese language this way too. Good show!
B002AL4A4E,S. Little,5,My kids and I love Kai-lan.  She's a wonderful example and friend and she shows little kids how the read the emotions of themselves and friends and figure out how to work together and be a wonderful friend!
B002AL4A4E,Sydney Domville,4,This show is too cute for its own good and I like to watch it when I'm sick. Sue me.
B002AL4A4E,vickie,5,The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wanted more and more
B002BEXZ32,Cortney Yonker,5,My 5 year old just loves this show and is excited for each episode to see what kind of adventure is going to be happening.
B002BEXZ32,E. Yeager,2,Not real impressed with a cartoon that has an udder on a male bovine. Typical uninteresting and dull cartoon: snooze
B002BEXZ32,Howard Roberson,4,Thanks for the listing
B002BEXZ32,L. Greene,5,This cartoon is hilarious and my grandson can't get enough.  It's his favorite show and one I don't mind watching with him.
B002BEXZ32,SHusk,4,Back at the Barnyard Season 2 - The children at my house were looking for something silly and fun and clean to watch.  We found this and they had a great time spending a few hours laughing and being children.
B002BLCNHY,dog lover,5,This is the best show we have seen in a long time.  We watched all of the seasons and were sorry when we finished them.  We can't wait for the new season to start in June.
B002BLCNHY,Donna Smith,5,I don't think this show gets enough credit. It is really good. Serious but light! The characters are great and the story line is a very good one!
B002BLCNHY,Retired in Hawaii,5,I enjoy watching the reruns of this show and I'm glad I purchased it. I received it in a timely manner and now can watch it over and over.
B002BSC29Q,Lyns the cook,5,One of the best shows ever. I can't believe it  has been cancelled again. The DVD came in good condition and works well.
B002BSC29Q,Picardfan007,5,Unfortunately Futurma is following the pattern of Family Guy.  The season sets have fewer episodes and are more expensive.  I do think it was just as strong as prior seasons. My favorite was the I Phone episode.  I wish that Futurama would do more TV science fiction parody type shows.  I have to wonder if they rotate writers between the Simpsons and Family guy because the humor is very uneven in some episodes.  If the writing keeps improving I would like to see Futurama run twenty seasons like the Simpsons.
B002C4Y3DC,drummer593,5,Love this sitcom it is as funny as hell! Everybody should own this sitcom! Can't ask for more! Plus it came real quick and came in excellent condition!
B002CHLG84,Amy M. Peterson,5,My 2 year old loves gabba and we watch it all the time. I like the guest stars and musical guests and that they teach good social skills.
B002CHLG84,Cindy Flowers,5,Our 2 and 3 year old love to dance and sing along with the gabba gang.  Very upbeat learning show that also teaches do's and don'ts of being a good person.
B002CHLG84,Jane,5,This series offers a gentle learning lesson and is a great way to entertain a toddler who likes to dance!
B002CHLG84,Laurie Chen,5,My sons watch this episode over and over again. We all dance and sing to Yo Gabba Gabba every day. Thanks to a friend that referred me !
B002CHLG84,M0ng0l13,5,For the record we wish Yo Gaba Gaba had been around when our 16 year old was born. It is a great show for the kids!
B002CHLG84,Paula S. Smith "ChefPaula1965",5,Great show witg lessons for the young and old... Please thank you magic magic magic
B002CHLG84,Stephen C. Rankin,5,Strange..but good clean toddler mesmerizing fun. The social skill focused topic is nice and he dances to the retro neuvo eclectic music.
B002DHDIJ8,Scott T. Hall "AMG Metal",5,Another tv show that didnt last long enough and was fun to watch. Yet crap like Survivor and House Whores of Beverly Hills go on for years and years. Our society is doomed.
B002EVGVBA,Amazon Customer,3,This is a fun and okay movie worth a watch.  Makes you feel good when he sees the light.  We enjoyed this movie.
B002EVGVBA,Amazon Customer,5,What an incredible movie. I was pleased with the story line and the relationships he developed (even if he wanted or not) with the other characters.  Viewers will identify with any of the characters.  Sorry no spoilers here.  Highly recomended!
B002EVGVBA,D Christiansen,3,I actually enjoyed this movie until the end. It was entertaining and the characters were interesting. However I was so disappointed with the ending that the best rating I could give is 3 stars.
B002EVGVBA,Lilly D,2,i just could not get into this movie. I wonder why it was  ever made. Do not bother watching it.
B002EVGVBA,Nana4,5,Always enjoy any movie with Jeff Daniels. He didn't disappoint me with Answer Man.  This a great feel good chick flick.
B002EVGVBA,Teddy and Me "JLEE",4,A really good story and a good movie.Jeff Daniels does a great job and so does Lauren Graham.Would highly recommend it.
B002H05O48,Mix-in-it,5,This is a show I got hooked on.  A co worker suggested it to me but then I only downloaded the pilot and didn't watch if for over a month. I was bored one day and decided to watch it. I was hooked after that.  I watched every season so far.
B002H0HZQS,John C Woods,5,A well made show with action and thought. One that is well worth watching. I would recommend it very highly.
B002H0HZQS,Mike,5,Very entertaining great cast slow past but hits the mark at the end and makes you wish that they kept it on tv.
B002H0HZQS,steve allison "steve",3,the plot is fairly interesting. The acting looks just that like there acting. If you want to see a good police drama watch the shield
B002H0HZQS,Susan Crow,1,After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode.  I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me.  It seems to be a dark mafia type show.  Some people may enjoy all the &#34;shoot them up&#34; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just doesn't measure up.  I would not recommend it.
B002H0HZQS,TAMUNOSIKI MINA,4,Just one episode and so far I love it and I will make sure I finish all the ones you
B002H0HZQS,The Librarian,5,I would recommend the show to anyone who has enjoyed the gritty cop shows of the past as well as newer stuff because it is well done with good cast and sequencing.
B002H0HZQS,Timothy J. Gannon,3,nice characters with decent chemistry; some of this loosing one's own personality while hanging out with very baad people goes on but this setup is way too awkward. I also hate the random -- you can't stream this episode.
B002HMJ4W4,Swamp Girl "Mae",4,Dirty Jobs is always enjoyable to watch - entertaining and educational.  Mike Rowe and his crew work really great together and really make watching the show fun.
B002IAAS2U,D. M. Garland,5,My grandkids love the cartoon and best of all I don't mind them watching it.  It doesn't get to me like some of the other children's programming.  (If I ever win the lottery I will buy the rights to Barney and burn every episode.)
B002IAAS2U,Mamaya706,4,My son loves spongebob and I'm so glad it's prime so he can watch it for free on my kindle. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because every 2 minutes it would pause for buffering.
B002IAAS2U,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",5,I watch it to lull me to sleep. Since when my boy was little we use to watch together on couch and fall asleep.
B002IAAS2U,Stephanie J. Trillo,1,I hate it and I think its a horrible show. Makes me want to hurt the writers and the creators.
B002IAAS2U,Tracy,2,I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children. This isn't a program that is watched very often at our house.
B002ICFX0U,Cathy P.,5,This is a good show. I would rather watch something that showed a case solved then one that wasn't solved
B002ICFX0U,combs,5,I like this series because of the same reason I liked to watch the other ones. How they solve the cases
B002ICFX0U,Diana Strole,5,I find true crime and true life events to be interesting and love watching them while my husband watches other things.
B002ICFX0U,Honey Solomon,3,This series was listed as 'suggested viewing.' Fault to me for not reading why it was suggested. Thirteen episodes later? Possible reasons are an interest in military medicine and forensic pathology. The episodes offer a reasonable account of several cases that I actually remember. The reenactments and the ability to follow the actual thought processes of those involved with both criminal and forensic aspects is well presented. The diagrams and conclusions of experts in multiple fields of criminology is definitely a positive. It certainly doesn't resemble my usual military history documentaries! Just because I stumbled into this doesn't mean that I wouldn't recommend the series for those with an interest in this genre. Not a 'TV person' so I have no reference point for a comparison. The personal interviews add the dimension of reality.
B002ICFX0U,Mary Spangler,5,Solved is worth watching if you love real crime shows. Discovery does them with real compassion but worth watching. I love the fact that this is a show that the case is solved and does not leave you hanging. Great reality show !
B002IEY0LQ,Diatom,4,Hope we as a country/world are never put into this scenario- how to survive when all resources are limited from a global catastrophy. My 12 yo finds this series addictive.
B002IEY0LQ,jcasch00,5,This series is more realistic them I though it would.  Certainly worth the 42 minutes to watch each episode. Get's you to thinking about the possibility it could be you!!!!!
B002IEY0LQ,John C Woods,3,This is a show that is worth watching but it seems like an almost impossible production to continue with.  A show like this cannotsucceed because the production is so difficult but it is worth watching
B002IEY0LQ,Marianna Conner,5,I enjoyed the show. It was food for thought. It's uplifting to see what a groupis capable of under adverse  conditions.
B002IEY0LQ,T's Amazon,4,this season was pretty interesting. The crew on this season had some stand outs that I would want to survive the end of the world with!
B002IVNLKA,David "Black Widow 2014",5,Robin williams is awesome in this movie. His comic genius never fails. This is a very good movie. You can never go wron with robin williams. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B002IVNLKA,G. Teslovich,1,(1.) Dumb; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were.(2.) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures.(3.) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story.
B002IVNLKA,mr. contrarian,4,Now that a reasonable amount of time has elapsed after the deaths of Michael Hutchence and David Carradine I suppose this subject had to be ridiculed.  It's too wierd not to.  Robin Williams goes underneath the material in some of his most subtle and understated acting ever.  The son is every man's worst nightmare.  I like the dad's actions that came out of his grief and I also liked his final speech.
B002IVNLKA,Raven "Raven",2,The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself. But the anti-homophobic [...] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times. It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life.... is this the way Americans are?? Sure seems it. What a let down. What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out... would we say the same if the word [...] was used instead of the fag word...? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review. For me an open minded free thinker... this is a waste of life and time. I gave it two stars for the acting BUT... (and butts come in all sizes) I doubt Amazon will post it.
B002IVNLKA,Ryan Mullin,1,It amazes me that such an amazing actor can star in such crap sometimes. This and the one where he works in the photo shop....crap!!!
B002IVNLKA,toadknocker,5,This is a great movie that makes a statement about life and how the people we idolize are complete fabrications.  In the movie the father comes clean yet in real life most do not and take the money. A must see movie that makes you think.
B002J4RW6U,Jennifer Faries,4,I liked it.  Some of it was typical and some not.  It wasn't a real edge of your seat but there were some tense moments.  I would recommend it as a lightly suspenseful.
B002J4RW6U,MawMaw PawPaw Bowden .,3,The show was good but not exceptional.  The story held my attention.  The show was fast paced and somewhat suspenseful.
B002J4RW6U,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,For a Free Prime I couldn't believe how good this movie was.  Lots of suspense all the way through.  Good actors and acting.  A+
B002JAU1X0,Alfonzo "charter duck",4,I was disappointed when Heroes went out of production.  At least I was able to view the series again and enjoy it again.
B002JAU1X0,al,5,i am disappointed on how they ended the show.  i still love the show the last season in the show.  check it out.
B002JAU1X0,I. McKinzie,5,I love this series ... keeps me on the edge of my seat ! Can hardly wait for the next series :-)
B002JAU1X0,Jessica,5,I have been a heroes fan for a long time. I was very upset that the seaon ended and that they did not pick up another season. This leaves you hung.
B002JAU1X0,Lamp base bracket,5,For a scifi type movies it seems almost real.  I would like to see more video entertainment as well done.
B002JAU1X0,LOVE ROMANCE "ITHADTOBEYOU",5,I really enjoy heroes I am NOT a sci-fi fan but this was absolutely a great movie.  I am wstching it again.
B002JAU1X0,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,I choose this rating cuz this season of heroes was amazing. the episodes never messed up with amazon and everything went just fine I would recommend this show to everyone
B002JAU1X0,Nicole Lewis,5,love this show. too bad this is the last season. love watching it anytime I want too. I love it
B002JAU1X0,Vicki Fleming,2,Just continues to go down hill.  I can see why the network did not renew.  A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential.
B002JJC6E8,denmich1997,1,They should have released this as a animated movie and not a motion comic.  The story deserves that. I bought thinking it was a movie I had missed.
B002JJC6E8,Jackino,2,I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic. I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating.  I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is.
B002JJC6E8,ronald koppinger,1,episodes are only $1 but its pretty slow kinda hard to watch...and for being only like 10mins it def is not worth it at all
B002JJC6E8,Where is my package anyway?,2,Welcome to the ADD format.  The "episodes" are about three minutes long; two per download.  Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over.  Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row.  An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format.
B002JPC4P8,thecoolcard,5,wow a good show. To good of a show not to have a second season or even more. I know firefly is the best show ever not to have a second season. this one is in the top 10. first 2 hours are a little slow but after that hold on.....well worth the power to run the tv. if You love science fiction you will love this
B002JTLLQC,His Beloved,3,Not the same without Phil. An adjustment in many ways. Looking forward to coming seasons.. I don't like having to give a specific numbers of words to give a review. I don't mind giving a review... just keep it simple.
B002JTLLQC,Kathleen Rowland,1,Same plot over and over again.  My husband watches it but it seems very boring to me.  Needs more plot variety.
B002JTLLQC,Larry M. Wright II,5,Love my Prime membership to see this season. Wish it allowed me to see 8 & 9 but not available with prime pay only.7 is a good turn on crews. The youth get dragged over the coals to know if this is for them. Cornelia get weather tested with new captains and new crew.Never gets boring.
B002K76UR8,denmich1997,1,Even a bad movie can be good but this isn't even bad good.  Not worth the bother no redeeming cheesiness.
B002K76UR8,norma jean kringer,5,This movie turned out better than I thought because the picture looked questionable as to quality of production and ideas.
B002KETO0Q,K. Marlow "Kat",5,I love Gus and Shawn I think it would be the coolest to just sit back and watch them work they have added so much laughter to my life and I encourage all my friends and co-workers to watch them just to get a good laugh and watch justice happen!
B002KETO0Q,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,Psych gets better and better with each season. You won't be disappointed by collecting this series. I noticed thou for the first time that both my purchases had the words disc made in Mexico on the plastic cover-what's up with that. Either I never noticed before on all my Amazon purchases of tv shows are made in Mexico for sale in USA and Canada only????
B002KEZ91E,mom12,5,I feel kind of sad that i'm already at the end of the series. I thought there was more but the last episodes have the same fun writing as the first few years.
B002KEZ91E,Sandra,5,I AM OCD SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND MONKSISSUES. LOVE THE SHOW . HAVE ALL THE SEASONS AND SO THANKFUL SINCE HE WILL NOT RETURN.
B002KF3U8M,A-Prime Fanatic "gamer",4,Mental Illness and the family relationship of that person is explored. Both in humor and real stresses to Tara and her family. Worth watching-definitely the entire series is needed to get a complete profile of these characters.
B002KF3U8M,crystal beckner,5,I LOVE THIS SHOW!! TONI COLETTE IS THE BEST! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE WATCH IT!!!IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE SHOW! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!
B002KF3U8M,kding,5,Great story and excellent acting. Toni Collette steals the show but John Corbett is right behind her. Love to see them both get their teeth into a really good story. Very intense. Very funny.
B002KF3U8M,Lamp base bracket,5,A great show that isn't boring because one never knows what will happen next.  And a guide said six more words are required. Toni C. does a great acting part with her many varied characters that she plays.
B002KF3U8M,R. Roeth,4,This show is so interesting in its depiction of a &#34;really&#34; dysfunctional family. Toni Collette is truly wonderful in how she &#34;morphs&#34; into her different personalities.
B002KF3U8M,Shadhawk,5,This show crack my up no matter how many times I watch it. Out of all the characters buck would be my favorite.
B002KGB2EU,Amazon Customer "Carolyn",5,I hate that this show was cancelled. It is very smart and sassy. Tim Roth is a great actor. I loved the premise for the show..
B002KGB2EU,Cat in NoCal,4,Addictive series.  Finished the second season and beginning the third.  Glad to see it's available on Amazon.  Series reminds me of great British crime series.  Highly recommended.
B002KGB2EU,DAE,5,The acting and writing is GREAT!  I wish the network would renew for a 4th season.  It's about time for an INTERESTING show on TV!
B002KGB2EU,Deanna R Taylor,5,It would be a better world if we could know what someone's intentions are just by reading their expressions.  All of the actors are outstanding.  The plots are original.  Cal Lightman is a quirky character.
B002KGB2EU,Ela,4,This series had a great first season.  They seemed to lose focus the second season but it is still very entertaining and way ahead of many other offerings.
B002KGB2EU,E. Lillian Creveling,5,It just an enjoyable series. I enjoy the concept of the series. Face reading is a very interesting plot.  Good show!
B002KGB2EU,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,We watch all the seasons of &#34;Lie to Me&#34; and loved it!  Acting and story line great!  We highly recommend.
B002KGB2EU,free spirit,5,What a great show.  It has everything plus you are learning something as well.  It is a very interesting concept and both crew and cast do an excellent job of keeping you entertained and wanting for more.  Kudos to them all.
B002KGB2EU,Kathryn A. Helmke "Kathy",5,Love this show!  Sorry it ended at season 3.  Great variety of story lines and funny characters.  Interesting to try and see if you can tell who is lying.
B002KGB2EU,Kizmet64,4,This show gets better as it goes along.  I'm not sure why it was cancelled but maybe because Tim Roth acts a little outthere for his character.
B002KGB2EU,lpearson,5,Cal Lightman is my favorite character. I see myself in him a lot although he is much better at reading faces than I am. This show is o e of my favorites.
B002KGB2EU,R. H. Newmark "BobN",5,The writers have brought in new characters which keeps the series interesting while slowly revealing background on the main characters to give the viewer a better appreciation of why they behave as they do. Not every episode will wow you but many will and they do manage some interesting surprises and comedy along the way.
B002KGB2EU,Sam,5,Can't say enough about this show. Tim Roth is the best actor I've seen for years. He portrays this character so well u think u know him. This is a must see show.
B002KGB2EU,Savannah,5,The stories are totally absorbing.  The application of the science offered by the Lightman Group seems endless so the stories are never duplicated and ALWAYS exciting.  Each episode leaves you wanting more.  The main characters are  very interesting and their stories continue to unfold in each episode making the series even more interesting.  Season 2  is great.  Check it out!
B002KGB2EU,sharon kemm,5,bloody fantastic! why isn't this on regular television? I'd be watching whenever it came on. if the powers that be did that- they'd have to keep the same cast. bloody enjoyable.
B002KGB2EU,Terrijean,4,Cal is a loveable rascal so you are instantly engahed! Lots of good science too. Plus the support staff and storylines are sooo believable.
B002KGB2EU,Wolfgang "Film & TV",5,WOW - after the first 12 episodes:not what I expected (different from season one) but the best"crime" TV show on the air now.... almost all episodes feellike a feature movie..... great stories - REAL GOOD stuff!(only in one early episode (2nd or 3rd) the Fox guys seemedto have forced some of their medieval stupidity on the writersand Cal acted totally implausible for a guy with his"talent".....)MUST BUY!!!!!
B002KGEORM,Amazon Customer,4,This is such an excellent and intense season.I love Opie and I hate seeing him go through so much :(Watching jax and Tara's relationship unfold is pretty awesome too
B002KGEORM,Amazon Customer "- the recovering utopian...",4,Good season. I have grown tired of the repetitive plots and increasing darkness but season 2 was still gripping and full of optimism.
B002KGEORM,Bevvie,5,Really a good show...always something going on .... Keeps you on your toes...never know what's gonna happen next....awesome...can't wait till the next show....
B002KGEORM,Bill K,4,Can't say that this series is not interesting. Keeps you guessing as to who really are the good guys and bad guys.
B002KGEORM,Cappnormal,5,I started watching this because Steven King recommended it and I like Steven King novels so he pulls a lot of weight in my book. Well I'm hooked! You won't fall asleep watching these shows. Fast and continuous action are what keep me glued to the set or tab.  My wife thinks I'm crazy. Don't get caught up with facts and details just sit back and enjoy.  Not for the weak of heart. It's adrenalin pumping action that will definitely raise the blood pressure.Lots of foul language and violence so be aware.
B002KGEORM,Charles Daniel Christopher,5,The show has good dramatic writing--assuming you ignore the errors concerning modern forensics.  Too many times the MC's club-members spit in the face of an enemy they've killed for any of them to be riding free.
B002KGEORM,Chazz in Vegas,5,After watching season 1 I'm hooked on this show can't wait to watch more.  The show just pulls you in and you can't wait to see how they will get out of the next problem.
B002KGEORM,Craig Louis Webber,5,Great story line and acting. The story line uniquely illustrates strong family morals and ethics in the same manner as &#34;The Godfather&#34;.
B002KGEORM,dlrespaul,5,This show was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4 more.
B002KGEORM,Doni. Wright,5,This is by far the best show on TV or ANYWHERE... Fabulous. I didn't think I was gonna like this but a friend talked me into watching it. she said &#34;just watch the first show... you'll be hooked&#34;  and I was ... very Hooked&#34;.
B002KGEORM,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,Wonderful DVD series! Received the set before promised date and love the package set.  This is a great show and now have the entire series.
B002KGEORM,Jessica,4,This is a great show. Love watching all the seasons to catch up and relive the story before the next season starts. The dvds came in in great condition and i have not had any issues with them.
B002KGEORM,J-Squared,5,even better than the first season. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B002KGEORM,K. Garrety "kellysb00kz",3,No complaints about this movie.  I would recommend this movie to others. It was not boring kind of slow and easy going.
B002KGEORM,Lady Raven RAVE!,5,Love season 2 very entertaining good story plot from season 1 right through season 2. If you like the channel FX tv shows then this one won't disappoint you.
B002KGEORM,L. Greene,5,I literally stayed up and glued to the tv all day and night finishing up the whole season in one sitting!  Twists you never saw coming.
B002KGEORM,Mark Hall,5,This show is amazing....Kurt Sutter has done it again... Fast paced and entertaining and a hit of humor...love the Gemma and Jax storyline...
B002KGEORM,Meggan "Meggan",5,This season wasn't as good as the first one but its worth watching if your going to wacth the series.
B002KGEORM,pepper1031,5,I bought the series for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Kurt Sutter is a genius and a this series is fantastic.
B002KGEORM,Rebecca Collins,5,Good show ... good characters ... great acting.Same review as the others -- better language could be used ... and less severe dramatics.I like the show -- I am watching all Seasons.
B002KGEORM,rose,5,good show..wish there was more gag reels and deleted scenes..i'm more about those things than the actual show...but that is not for the seller that is for kurt sutter to do.
B002KGEORM,scent chick,5,I would have never watched this show if my son had not teased me!  So not my kind of show - it took me about all of season one to get &#34;involved&#34; with the show to want to keep watching - now I can't stop watching!  GREAT SHOW!
B002KGEORM,Stella Shahan "sastar27",5,this was a very potent soa and man the third season is off the chain as well.  Can't wait to get the other seasons as when you watch them in this style versus TV it's more understanding.
B002KGFK52,Chad A. Barts "Chadillac",5,Best show ever. If you like watching total degenerates do as they please in some of the best and moast hilarious situations you will love this show.
B002KGFK52,Consumer 45,5,Nothing sacred has been spared on this series but the characters and writers have made their handling of each topic very funny! Over and over I can play each episode -and I do- and not get bored. It is a very good series.
B002KGFK52,Lovblad,2,This used to be hilarious. Now it is simply obnoxious. The series is no longer funny at all. This is mainly due to Danny De Vito. This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny.
B002KGFK52,N. Dillon "International reader",5,I love &#34;It's Always Sunny!!!&#34; Who wouldn't? I love Frank. I wish I were a part of this cast. The stories the come up with get zanier and zanier everytime and I LOVE IT!
B002L4BQ42,Jason Nobody,2,Wow... I can't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn.
B002LS7YVM,Brynnlux "Brynn Lux",5,I sooo wish this show hadn't been cancelled and had caught on like Dora did. I cannot stand Dora and my toddler loves Kai-lan. She loves the music and animation so much more. Kai-lan is adorable. Our toddler has some crazy mood swings and when we sing Kai-lan's songs about dealing with feelings they REALLY help.
B002LS7YVM,Jennifer D. Williams,5,My five year old son loves this show.  It teaches social skills and Chinese all at the same time. Nice clean program for any age!
B002LS7YVM,JMV,3,Not as good as hit as Dora de Explorer at least according to my son's opinion... maybe the graphics need a little improvement and the storyline... but overall I think is a decent cartoon... and teaches the kids possitive things and good behavior... something that's is not so common anymore.
B002LS7YVM,Jon O "Health Care Worker",4,Grea Educational Show For Your Kids. Teaches About Interactions With Friends And respecting Their Feelings. Helps Your Children Learn Respect.
B002LS7YVM,Kerry,5,This show is very cute. My 8 month ok loves it. And I love that its on prime. The 2 year old like it as well.
B002LS7YVM,Mo.C,4,My daughter really likes this show.  Lots of bright colors and lovable characters.  It's very similar to Dora and Diego in teaching frequently used words from other languages.
B002LS7YVM,Stephen C. Rankin,4,He actually walked up to my Chinese doctor and said Ni Hao.  not bad for a 2 year old. Entertaining and valuable - I recommend it.
B002LS7YVM,vickie,5,The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wanted more and more.
B002M5JY9O,carol irvin "carol irvin",4,I've never watched this show before and do find myself intrigued by it.  This week's challenge was to cook a fantastic pork dish paired with red wine (to be drunk).  The guest judge is very serious about his red wine so the two had to be perfect complements.  Amazing that there are this many super artistic ways to cook and present pork with red wine.  I just went and watched every back episode to this season as well and found them all fascinating.  Generally I don't like reality tv but these shows where you learn something are a bit different.  This is very much like Project Runway but about food instead of clothes.  I like both shows and have learned a lot.
B002M5JY9O,Dominic Freeman,5,I just love the competition . The rotating judges are a good idea also. I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to the preparation of food through friends and associates. Great Show
B002M5JY9O,nancy,5,Had a few problems with watching it but customer service did a great job working it out. Loved it.
B002MZKACY,Carl Patrick Mainwaring,5,Fun show that highlights the faults of what happens when companies get too big! I like how they use irony in the episodes.
B002MZKACY,Doc "Doc",4,Anyone who has worked for a company will find the humor in this both subtle and spot on.The ensemble cast is amazing and features more from the scientists and 'big bad boss' Portia.Hysterical and a joy to watch.
B002MZKACY,Elizabeth Johnson,5,GREAT show. Even funnier cause we all know corporations think like that. Too bad this show was so short lived.
B002MZKACY,techie mike,5,Few shows are as engaging and the characters are superb!  Portia is fantastic and the rest of the cast incredible.
B002MZKACY,tomtom,5,It's a shame that it is no longer on air. It was one of the few comedies that actually made you laugh. The characters and the actors who portray them are wonderful. Everything clicks.
B002N4QCTE,Judith Ramsey,4,Some movies are better the second time around ...this one definitely is worth seeing twice at least. Interesting story and very good writing and acting.
B002N4QCTE,Marilyn M. Green,5,Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.
B002N4QCTE,Mike von R,5,This movie has the&#34; feel&#34; of being authentic from the opening scenes; all three actresses come across as totally real persons.
B002N4QCTE,The OC,2,Movie lasts less than 2 hours.  Seemed like 3 hours.  Characters and script generally not believable.  This is directorial debut of a screenwriter.  Lack of directorial experience shows.  Excellent cast wasted.
B002N4QCTE,Walter Orlandini,2,Could not figure out what the story line was. Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines. I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes.
B002N4QCTE,Wimpy Charley "Wimpy",5,Just collecting movies with Jennifer Lawrence in it.  It is a good movie and was early in her career so it is only brief with her in it.
B002NJUNMG,Elaine Gowder,4,I enjoyed the story line in this film.  I liked the fact that the story was set some other place than the U.S.  The actors did a very good job making me believe they were part of the police force.  I would recommend this film to other people who enjoy crime stories.
B002NJUNMG,W. Simons "Wendi8",5,Anything Timothy Hutton appears in is certain to be interesting and worth seeing more than once.  He's one of the finest actors in film and on TV and has deserved far more Oscars and Emmys than he has received.  I'm waiting for the next DVD I can order that features his work.
B002NUXBLA,Amazon Customer "Grumpy",5,These kids are energetic and talented. My 3 year old granddaughter dances around the house listening and watching them. She loves the Fresh Beat!
B002NUXBLA,DJ MinWah,5,Happy to have gotten something that my niece likes.  She sings the songs and is always asking to have the disc played on repeat.  I'd recommend this for 2 to 4 year olds.
B002NUXBLA,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,He gets so excited when it comes on!  He knows the theme song and has learned almost all the songs they sing and has learned the dances.  I enjoy taking the time to watching it with him.  Great show!
B002NUXBLA,Stephanie J. Trillo,4,I want to go to their concert. There I admit it. That's how much I like this show. Its a nice break from the animation and my kids like to get up and dance.
B002NUXBLA,Venna,5,My son is autistic so he really really likes bright colors and music so it works really well for him.
B002NUXBLA,Wayne E. Delong,5,My four year old loves this show. When my son was younger he also loved it. Unlike a lot of the Disney stuff that I won't let my kids watch alone anymore until I'm sure they are not pushing sex on my four year old daughter. The fresh beat band is fun where my kids just get to dance along and sing and I don't have to worry about the message.
B002NWNTL0,Annie,5,Another great mini series with another batch of excellent acting. Don't know if there are any more or that's it. I have been looking for things to watch and have to say Masterpiece theatre has not let me down yet!
B002NWNTL0,A. R. St Jean "ARS",4,We always enjoy Mr. Cumberbatch; an excellent actor. The script was very good and the plot presented a very plausible reality. Scary!
B002NWNTL0,Artemus Returns,5,Another great BBC production. This one has the former Mr. Holmes as a mild mannered mathematician who continually does what no one else can do.Great series looking forward to more form BBC/
B002NWNTL0,babsd,5,I watched this series on TV before but have gone back to it on my Kindle to focus on the deatils. The acting is superb and no on e is who you think they are. Superb plot lines and characters.
B002NWNTL0,BM3,5,The premise of the show was very good and really makes you think about the lack of privacy in this post 9-11 world. It is a show that really makes you think about mandatory identification cards and how a good idea can turn bad with the wrong people in charge. Highly recommend the entire series.
B002NWNTL0,B's Mom,5,Excellent!  With lots of suspenseful and unpredictable twists. The acting was great. Especially Robert Carlyle playing the ultimate bad guy whose motives come as quite a surprise.
B002NWNTL0,Dean Collins,5,I found this to be a very intense mini-series where everybody must have an ID card to exist.  I was looking forward to the next segment each time and was disappointed that it ended.
B002NWNTL0,Dgst "Gitte Strauss",4,This is a fast paced action series. The plot is one that could easily be a reality some day which made this series riveting to watch. Some of the characters were a bit confusing as to who they worked for which made some scenes hard to understand. Benedict Cumberbatch does a marvelous job in his role and his reaction to certain events are dead on for the personality type he is portraying.
B002NWNTL0,Doc "Doc",5,PBS called this SciFi - seems more like fact in many instances.  I enjoy Mr. Cumberbatch as an actor and respect the ensemble cast.
B002NWNTL0,Duc Nguyen,5,Cumberbatch is excellent.  The story line is great about the new surveillance environment we are living in and what is to come.  Watch if you are interested in how subtle we loose the rights we have come to be consider in alienable.
B002NWNTL0,exwyzee8,5,I love Ben Cumberbatch. He is amazing in everything!!! I love this series. It's an interesting plot about how government tracts us without our knowledge and how much worst this is going to get in the near future.  I am going to watch this again and again. The acting is superb.
B002NWNTL0,frank a chambers,5,I really enjoyed Mr Cumberbatch as Sherlock and figured he would be good in this role.  Kept me interested and intrigued and I can not wait until I can continue with the series.  I do not know why the Brits just seem to be masters at this sort of television.
B002NWNTL0,Fred,4,A look into the near future of big government. The problem with universal identification cards. Maybe fiction but probably nearer to the truth.
B002NWNTL0,Genavee,5,I love British TV anyway but this series blows everything out of the water! I think everyone should be playing attention to what this show is showing and even through the host makes a point of stating this is just a TV shows these things are already in place and growing! I am not sure it is still on because there was only one season available on Amazon.I love everything I ever watch with Benedict Cumberbatch in he is such a great actor and so believable in every part he plays whether it is in this show or Sherlock Holmes. He is the best Sherlock! He stole each scene he was in! Love this actor he is brilliant ! The Brits really produce and write excellent shows! Bring more seasons to Amazon!
B002NWNTL0,JanR,5,Cumberbatch is better than ever in this tense drama.Everyone's acting is terrific; writing is top notch.Grabs you right away.
B002NWNTL0,Jim,5,I think the british do a great job on movies. For some reason the put it all together and make a better show than we do.I liked it very much.
B002NWNTL0,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,Hidden gem of show where the cast interaction is on level of excellence bar none.  A thespian experience that is intense and surprising moment by moment as the story goes on!
B002NWNTL0,John,5,This is a very good mystery.  I believe you will enjoy this movie and is good for the whole family.  Very good acting in this movie.
B002NWNTL0,John J. Schmidt,4,Suspenseful series. Where is Volume 2 available? I have looked on Amazon.com and did not find it? Can anyone tell me where I can get the subsequent volumes of this series?
B002NWNTL0,John O. McMurren,3,Enjoyed the acting but it was kinda disjointed and ended badly...it needs a 2nd season! A bit too preachy too.
B002NWNTL0,Julie "juliedolls",4,This show highlights the increasing surveillance culture we are living with. It is chilling to realize how many of the surveillance features predicted by the show are now commonplace.
B002NWNTL0,jv,3,So Benedict Cumberbatch plays this socially awkward genius with a family connection in the government to help figure out the death of his brother.  Add some government conspiracies and Afghanistan spy intrigue and there we go for nice dramatic miniseries.What makes it especially relevant today is the government Total Information Access (TIA) where they use big data to spy on citizens.  It probably was more sci-fi when this was filmed but now we know the NSA is already doing this to us.  For each episode a narrator came on to explain the TIA to us if the exposition in the show wasn't enough.In general I liked the series.  Good production values and some dramatic scenes but I often lost the plot details if I wasn't paying close attention.
B002NWNTL0,K. A. Morgan "book relisher",5,I liked this tale.  It is very thought provoking.  It helps the viewer understand the price of having so much personal information on the Internet.  I have only watched three episodes but have enjoyed them immensely.
B002NWNTL0,Marilyn M. Green,5,I chose this rating because I couldn't put my Kindle down. It had a slow start but then it started to move at a faster pace. By the time it was over I was crying with the main character. There were twists and turns I didn't see coming which increased my enjoyment because I couldn't predict accurately what was going to happen. I don't know if this story is for everyone but I did enjoy it.
B002NWNTL0,Nancy Tice,4,Just started watching and got distracted by busy life. Did enjoy what I've seen so far. Will definitely continue viewing when I have time
B002NWNTL0,PoohBearsf,5,Found this show when I was having Sherlock withdrawls. I really liked it but it obviously was cancelled since it was filmed in 2008 and says Season One. So take it for what it is and enjoy.
B002NWNTL0,Richard Goodlette,5,Am a big fan of &#34;what if&#34; movies and The Last Enemy is illustrative of this category. Thought provoking with relevance to our modern plight: how much of who we are will forfeit to our government for the sake of security? What guarantee do we have that the State will respect our privacy? How much have we already given away? Excellent movie!
B002NWNTL0,Robertson Davies "George",3,Starts with a decent premise but goes off the rails a bit with lead character's sudden emotional flowering. Not fully believable but aspects of the plot kept me watching. Solid cast well directed and filmed with style. Completists must see.
B002NWNTL0,Sjc62,5,I've always like Benedict Cumberbatch. I first watched him in Masterpiece Theater's Sherlock which he does masterfully. I haven't watched all of this series but the first episodes were very exciting.
B002OLLH46,dvdjhll,1,Not sure what is the point of putting things like this on the internet. Spend your time staring into the sun. You will have find it more fulfilling.
B002OLLH46,Paula S. Smith "ChefPaula1965",5,Fund movie to watch with the family. A little too much action for my 16 year old daughter but just right for my husband and our 13 year old son...
B002OLLH46,SuperDad "SuperDad",2,I was looking for more of a sneak peak and not so much of an interview with the actors. Not what I wanted.
B002OLLH46,todd,5,awesome show in hands i would probably give any of the x-men movies a  five star review in action and adventure
B002PHW9H8,David "Black Widow 2014",5,This is a really good movie. it has heart and soul. this is probably one of the best and funniest eddie murphy movies i've seen in a while. and the little girl who plays his daughter in the movie is going to be an upcoming actress. she is so cute and really smart. i loved the story. and all the actors were great. this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B002QEA7BA,Borat's Bad Brother,2,This is clearly a Thai film! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line. Mainly at the end. It's like Rambo without the guns. Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses. The costumes were fantastic though. I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa's previous movie "The Protector"! Now that was amazing. This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers. Perhaps 12-18 years of age? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony! That's gonna be good!...
B002QEA7BA,Christ's Soldier,5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This movie rocked because of it's awesome fights scens and I am pretty certain no other movie has stunts like this with elephants! Props
B002QNBRYM,gary blakely,4,names in hollywood want to play on this show....while so far fetched in human behavior it becomes hilarious to watch each characters antics
B002QNBRYM,Jack Summer,1,A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle.  I'll pass.  I don't need this crap entertainment.
B002QNBRYM,Larry R. Rhude,5,Possibly a glimpse into the life style of the Beautiful people of Southern California and probably isn't confined to Them alone.
B002QNBRYM,Lizs Home Made,5,The third season was filled with eventful twist and turns. This show is addicting. I want to see more and more. I recommend go back and watch all the seasons. I have seen every single show. I highly recommend this show.
B002QNBRYM,Melesio Gonzalez,4,I enjoye watching the antics of the artsie LA scene.  Can anyone really live that life of booze and drugs and survive?
B002QNBRYM,Simon Sez,4,Season three...the sizzle season....strippers. faster pussycat...ow!!  going across so many  ethical lines in the student teacher bond.......TA....TNA....RUNKLE....Cathleen turner...Dickie.....Rick Springfield...cocaine and lobsters... does it really get any more surreal than this?  Not really  but the  plot lines  are good still  no jumping of the shark...I like the B listers  that  appear  in the series.  Rick Springfield  is awesome! Cathleen turner's role is perfect...Peter Gallagher as the Dean ...awesome!  This was campy..cheesy good writing. It makes me wonder if these circles do exist....Anyhow I wish  that seasons were available as free  I would liketo really see how they  work it out in NYC...or not!  Collini out !
B002QNBRYM,Uncle Dale,2,This is about a father who is into substance abuse who seems to think it is ok to pass these traits to his kid. It shows how irresponsible the left coast is. We can say what a wonderful performance. Doesn't anyone look at the substance of the show. If you try to live by the golden rule these folks live by the it's all about me. If this is the real world.God help America.
B002QS5OQ4,al,5,not out for that long do not know why?  i never watched this TV show when it came no rips dents or other disasters to the case.
B002QS5OQ4,Book Lover "CYN",5,I love the Stargate Universe series. The actors are so perfect for their parts and it is a joy to watch this science fiction action. I higly recommend it to all scifi fans.
B002QS5OQ4,Chinabug "chinabug",1,I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU.  I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring.  The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry.  The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough.  I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up.  I wouldn't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it.
B002QS5OQ4,George Shaffer,2,Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
B002QS5OQ4,Goober,1,Don't waste your time on this series.  It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.
B002QS5OQ4,lremick,5,Great series. It was great getting to see how people are at their best and worse it any given circumstance
B002QS5OQ4,@margaret,1,Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits
B002QS5OQ4,Michelle Gould,5,I love sci-fi. This almost makes me wish that I had a chance to be on the Destiny. Imagine if we could experience something like this. Great imagination. I wish it was still on. Everyone who is behind the show did absolutely fabulous job and thanks to Amazon for bringing us the series.
B002QS5OQ4,setzco,3,I felt the first season was very dark and all the characters only seemed interested in thier own interest they didn't really care about the rest of the crew only whats in it for them.  The only real exception to that was the kid that solved the game he pretty much started out as a generally good guy that was always trying to look out for everyone's interest; I liked the final season much better as they started to turn this idea around and made everyone more concerned with the group and less concerned with themselfs.
B002QS5OQ4,Stanley Cook,5,This is a different kind of scifi.  I'm still in season 1 and it will be interesting to see where it goes.
B002QS5OQ4,Ted Robbins,5,Certainly among the top 5 sci-fi pieces I've ever seen. Ranks with 'Fringe' for instance. Keep um coming. This is a movie buff's dream.
B002QS5OQ4,victoria,4,This was very good. Not quite as good as Stargate SG-1 but equally as adventurous. A wide variety of characters. Some you love and some you want to kick in the pants but all in all that's what makes a great series is the different personalities. Quite a concept being on a space ship traveling through outer space not knowing where it's going or if you will ever be able to return home.
B002QS5OQ4,Wayne Midkiff,5,This show is quite different from Stargate because it has a story line from one show to the other and can be followed accordingly.  The plot has a lot of suspense and mystery to it but is quite intertaining.  Would recommend this show.
B002QS5OQ4,William,2,Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing. Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes.
B002R2G97C,Gizmo "ctwin60",4,These are real homicides that don't always get solved quickly or at all. The detectives are good at their jobs and do lots of foot work not the fancy high tech stuff seen on the CSI shows. The detectives care about the people they come into contact with and are really good at catching criminals. If you like true crime you should try this program
B002R2G97C,Jack,5,I just love the series. It's very interesting and gripping to see these detectives work cases. Great show to watch.
B002R9LQN2,Brenda D. Nelson,4,A lot of information about our leadership here that I did not know.  I would give it 5 stars except that the series seems to praise presidents for some things that I think are anti-constitutional.
B002R9LQN2,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",4,Not enough depth. I love bios and want to know more. Still I do enjoy the series and will see more episodes.
B002R9LQN2,Catherine T. Burnes "Catherine T.",5,An overview of many of the Presidents of the USA with information on their political lives and glimpses into their private lives.  Entertaining and educational.
B002R9LQN2,Dancy Girl,5,Loved the series we have watched so far.  Very informative - much information that was unknown to us.  Would recommend this to all ages as a great history lesson.
B002R9LQN2,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,We really enjoyed &#34;American Experience:  The Presidents&#34;!  It was so informative about each president.  It gave you an insight of their private and public lives.  We highly recommend seeing this well-made production.
B002R9LQN2,Gina,5,Excellent!!! Loved it! it covered the president whole life without dragging it out!! Great film clippage. Can't wait to watch all of them!
B002R9LQN2,Success,5,Excellent behind the scenes look at the lives and deeds of our presidents. Listen in to their taped conversations with most trusted confidantes. Great historical benefit. Here's a revelation...our presidents are NOT saints with the best interests of American's at heart!
B002R9NINS,CW FISHER "stars for connie",4,This was a good series on empires and The Saga of the Israelites was very good and informative.  This series is good for the whole family and I like history and looking at it is a lot better than just reading about it.
B002S28HUS,David Bower,4,DCI Barnaby is an interesting character and charmed us with his laid back style of solving mysteries. The scenery is lovely and typically British and the acting measures up to the usual high standards of British TV. This series is extensive and so far has avoided the pitfall of too much depravity to the point of spoiling the whole effect.I recommend this series for the family.
B002S5TVSW,whatnot,2,I enjoy watching shows with real evidence proof like forensic files. This show is created poorly with subject matter had to believe. Was deceived by the title.
B002SDOI14,AzLou,5,I love this series. I purchased seasons one and two. Both seasons are awesome. My sister purchased the remaining two seasons (three and four). This is definitely another winner.
B002SDOI14,Book worm,5,Great show.  Something different than all the other shows out there.  Wish they had more episodes each season.
B002SDOI14,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,This is one of the most important seasons of Sanctuary. Because it ties together so many of the questions left unanswered by season 1.
B002SDOI14,DIANNA,5,THIS IS A GREAT SERIES FOR THE MONEY. IF YOU LIKE SCI FI WITH SUSPENCE AND SOME MONSTERS IN IT THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU. GREAT ACTING AND STORY LINE ESPECIALLY WITH THE LOW BUGET THEY HAVE FOR THESE SHOWS.
B002SDOI14,E. Helms,4,Very different sci-fi / fantasy concept. Good actors and they worked hard to make you believe the fantasy. Fun for the sci-fi fix. Season 2 was not my favorite but a fun watch.
B002SDOI14,Johanna Wiese,5,Amanda Tapping has created a futuristic (but realistic) show. I wish it had gone on longer (Boo to the networks for cancelling it!). Thank you for 4 wonderful seasons of creativity.
B002SDOI14,lremick,5,The season I received came from Amazon and was in excellent conditiion and on time. I enjoyed this season very much as I did not have to see the commericals. The extra were interesting
B002SDOI14,Penny,5,The Sanctuary DVDs are well written and well acted.  They keep you interested and wanting to buy the next season.
B002SDOI14,Puck,5,I am patiently waiting for the next season.  Twists in plots and a few special effects keep us wanting more.
B002SDOI14,ROY,5,I was really hooked to the first season and now a more exciting and action second season has added more questions..Can hardly wait for the thirsd season.
B002SDOI14,Scott Solomon,5,This is one heck of an excellent series. Very unique and creative. Excellent writers to come up with the new episodes. As usual the stupid big wigs at the studio canceld this great show after four seasons. &#34;Shmucks&#34;!!!!
B002SLIATC,JT,5,Nice off-shoot of &#34;Greys Anatomy&#34;. The actors characters have diverse personalities and interactions that makes each episode different and interesting to watch. Tends to be a bit too serious at times.
B002STKILW,Alex Ross,3,equal operunity insult.if you like south park & family guy you will like Tosh.not much more to say
B002STKILW,Amazon Customer,5,Tosh.0 is the best of the youtube commentary type of shows. I can't believe how funny he is. I just peed.
B002STKILW,Angela,5,Watching the episodes with my Prime subscription has been awesome!  Daniel Tosh is hilarious and I laugh out loud while watching him.  He is a gifted comedian and you can tell his crew work hard to find the funniest clips from the internet for our enjoyment. Season 1 and 4 are free for Prime members... I just wish season 2 and 3 were free as well. Daniel Tosh has become a fast favorite of mine... right after Joan Rivers! : )
B002STKILW,Ian Jamieson,5,Tosh is funny. Not very original more commentary/observational but still very funny. Mostly internet videos that are very funny. Funny
B002STKILW,LMB "LMB",5,This guy is so funny. The writers are excellent! IT's non-stop entertainment. Only he can be high-brown and uhm very low-brow at the same time. love it. Can't stop watching.
B002STKILW,Rod,3,I enjoy watching Tosh.0 but the first season just didn't have very good material. His later seasons get much funnier.
B002T33I64,Belizelovely,5,I chose 5 stars because everyone loves Sesame Street. Very informative and my 3 year old loves the music and lessons taught in the show. Definitely recommend watching.
B002T33I64,BHoward,5,This is my son's favorite show.  He is overly obsessed with Sesame Street!  I love amazon prime for having these seasons!
B002T33I64,DG,5,It's Sesame Street what more is there to say
B002T33IAA,A. Terry,5,My Granddaughter loves this video.  The colors of the characters are so vibrant and they are so animated!!  It's no wonder that Sesame Street has stood the test of time!!  I enjoyed watching the video with her.
B002T33IAA,BHoward,4,Our baby absolutely loves all that is sesame street.  He can sit through the entire show and be content and this is the ONLY thing that can give him such contentment.
B002T33IAA,Fannie Tillman,5,I I like my brothers did to that was a very very very good show... All Kids like to show that ...is a very very very good show.
B002T33IAA,JCraul,5,I have a 2 yr old and she loves the all of the cartoons shows available on the prime channel.
B002T33IAA,Paul,5,My granddaughter watches this show and series every time she comes over. Great for all ages.Wish II had this when I was a child.
B002T33IAA,Ty's Tiny Tip,5,My daughter loves Sesame Street and I love that's its quality educational programming. She counts and sings along with them the whole time. Its very interactive and she stays entertained.
B002TNS012,Alison G. Jones "babybear",5,too bad it was cancelled - i watched this through the entire season on the tv but missed the last two episodes so it was nice to catch up - too bad they didn't really tie up all the storylines.
B002TNS012,B. Hamlin,5,I liked  this series a lot. It's too bad it was canceled. I thought it was interesting and entertaining I am glad the woman who played the mother V is now on Homeland.
B002TNS012,Mpr90,5,I LOVE this show! Definately one of ABC's best! I'm loving the second season and hope many more are to come!
B002TNS012,ROY,5,This show really had me hooked with the way the aliens were moving in an then how the earthlings were awaking to see what was happening and what they were trying to do to counter these actions by the aliens..Cannot wait to see the second season..
B002TNS012,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",4,OOOOh creepy and I am enjoying it immensely.  It has me watching all of the series with no problem whatsoever.
B002TUO2SU,Amanda,5,Can someone please tell me how long the extended version is? How any hours and minute? I want to make sure it's the full version which I've heard is better.  Thanks!
B002TUO2SU,A. R. St Jean "ARS",5,This film was extremely well done and historically accurate. One could wish that Hollywood could put forth films of this quality.
B002TUO2SU,Carol,1,Don't like subtitles in my movies.  Most Asian movies turn me off completely..  They are not my idea of entertainment
B002TUO2SU,JOSE PEREGRINA DE LA P,4,Good  movie but in chinise. It should be better if this was in english. but it was a good movie.
B002TUO2SU,Kitty,3,This was very violent and almost 95% battle scenes between two rival family battling for control of territory.  The story line was weak and hard to follow.
B002TUO2SU,LT,5,I was expecting this to be along the lines of Curse of the Golden Flower; it was better.  This is a look at warring factions during the end of the Han dynasty.  Everything was good about it.  The only thing that some people may not like is it is in Chinese with English subtitles.
B002TUO2SU,Michael,5,This movie was spectacular! I love the history. Stunning! If you are a fan of the three kingdoms era then this is a must watch.
B002TUO2SU,M S SELIGMAN "pistolera",2,BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  Don't waste your time.
B002TUO2SU,P. Houle,5,Wow! I'm not one to watch war movies at all. It was the interest in Chinese history that made me watch. An epic!
B002TWWOHE,DonnaSays "Amazon makes my Life easy!",5,I Love this show...White Collar: Season OneMatt Bomer...bought all seasons my daughters favorite show. He is such a cutie.
B002TWWOHE,E. Lillian Creveling,5,What a great show. It's interesting and clean. It keeps you thinking of how he will solve the problems. I can hardly wait for season 2 to be released.
B002TWWOHE,HobieBritt,5,Matthew Bomer as the lead criminal in White Collar definitely carries the season into incredible crime solving. With some humor and danger the season is exciting and attention grabbing. White Collar crime has never been so exciting.
B002TWWOHE,Michael Duffy,5,a very original series... can't recall anything like it in all my years of watching hollyrock.  great views of nyc and matt bomer is exceptional as an art thief!
B002TWWOHE,Opinionbyme,4,Since I'm paying for two other shows this one is not as good.It's a fun show to watch not too serious plus he's good looking.
B002UC15DC,Bekka "Bekka",4,Great info about Joan. Stuff I didn't know. Really show just how determined she was to be a star! Definitely recommend.
B002UC15DC,Evelyn M. "new at this",5,She had an interesting life and I was pleased to hear about her being defended against her daughter. The daughter who wanted an acting career and a rich Daddy. Considering the fact that she was an adopted child I do not believe that she appreciated Joan Crawford as a mother or anything else. She was a self made woman. She deserves credit.
B002UC15DC,P. Shanahan "Fathead",4,A nice counterpoint to the lasting damage waged by Christina Crawford in &#34;Mommie Dearest.&#34; Great review of the career of one of Hollywood's most enduring and hardest working stars of the Golden Age. Some background and behind the scenes info brings Miss Crawford to life. It's hard to believe the woman Christine wrote about is the same woman. Ultimately Crawford's work outlasts any hatchet jobs by spiteful children getting revenge for being left out of the will.
B002UIEMA4,the Commish!!!,1,i do not know who in the family was watching this one no one will admit to having watched it.
B002UIEMA4,victoria,5,This was a little slow at times be patient though because  I found it to be very entertaining. you will enjoy it.
B002UJRM64,Alla,1,I used to like this guy. But the show is not funny not funny not funny. I did not bother seeing more than one episode and I doubt I will see another one. I could not even finish the first one. Really surprising.
B002UJRM64,Charlie,3,and this show did not disappoint. It is funny and fast moving. There were only a relatively few shows listed for the season. I hope they are planning a season two.
B002UJRM64,Darrell Irvin "Darrell druidwriter",5,This man has transformed so many characters with personalities and voices to match that it makes for an extremely entertaining show.
B002UJRM64,D. M. Garland,2,I have always enjoyed Jeff Dunham on variety shows.  He has created some great characters and is very funny.  Unfortunately the concept just doesn't work.
B002UXAEV0,kmoore,5,Really funny show. Nick kroll never disappoints :) I don't follow sports but this show is still hilarious . I recommend it
B002UXAEV0,Steve Abbott,5,I was actually shocked at how funny this show is.  It's basically guys getting together with guys and talking smack like guys do.
B002VVCMTS,Karen P,5,I love Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton - I wish both actors were in more movies.  I didn't know what to expect with this movie but didn't think I would enjoy it so much.  Meg and Timothy really clicked in this movie and I think it is now one of my favorites.
B002W0N2X8,BK Perea,4,As always &#34;Shirley Temple &#34; is a doll. Love these old flicks. Just adorable. Timeless. Shirley Temple. Love to watch
B002W0N2X8,Greg,5,This is a great movie for us &#34;old timers&#34; who can remember the &#34;Lil Rascals shows&#34; I loved to watch these. I am sorry that she passed away but living to be 85 was a great long life.
B002Y0TGOU,J. Hartmann,5,I saw this movie 7 times in the theater.  I absolutely loved every second of it and will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD.  I highly recommend Star Trek to everyone. This movie exceeded all my expectations and more.My favorite characters in the movie are Jim Kirk and Bones. Both of the actors who portrayed said characters did an amazing job and in my opinion made the movie even more amazing. All of the other people in the movie were also very good too.  I especially liked Scotty.  He is a hoot!What are you waiting for?  Go and see the movie!!!
B002Y0TGOU,Roger,5,Great reboot of the Star Trek Franchise which deserves to be seen on Blu-ray. A great deal for under ten dollars.
B002Y0TGOU,R. Roberts,5,A new story to an old fan loving show.  This movie was definitely worth the watch.  The actors were pretty much true to the original charactors. I was very pleased with this outing into familiar territory.
B002Y0TGOU,Scott,3,I do not like that they wiped out all the history and now can do anything they want now. The relationship between Uhura and Spock is kind of creapy?
B002Y0TGOU,Terrianne Neill,5,I love this movie! It had great special effects and a wonderful story line too! It is a movie that should not be missed!
B002YJN6KQ,Amazon Customer,1,Not what I thought it would be...name is a little misleading. Perhaps I should have thought about it before selecting it for review.
B002YJN6KQ,Amazon Customer,3,This is an informational video on several different islands.  Gives you a brief look at each.  I would have liked a little more info. but it did let me taste of the different areas.
B002YJN6KQ,irabby,2,Not much to look at. A straight ad. Some pretty sights but not worth the time it took to watch
B002YJN6KQ,melinda,1,Very disappointed wouldn't recommend it at all! It downloaded good but other than that it isn't worth any ones time!
B002YJN6KQ,R. Turnbull "art lover",5,I want to go to every island paradise featured in this video. I don't remember them all right now but each one was fantastic. More places to add to my bucket list.
B002YJN6KQ,Virgil F. Keller,1,This looked like an advertisement and not a movie or entertainment.  I simply could not watch all of it as it seemed a complete waste of time!
B002YWXMKM,stoneyb,5,excellent. What is not to like about our Navy SEALs.  Well done by all the actors and the writers. WOW
B002YWXMKM,Susan C Johnson,4,Pretty intense.  Seal Team VI seems to be a heralded group of soldiers from way back.  Gives insight into current events.
B002Z01XOU,Robert M. Kirwan "World Traveller",5,This one is like the first one.  Lots of action with a short story thrown in for good measure.  Heroes and Bad guys in a world torn with poverty and strife.  Not so far fetched anymore.
B0030I61FW,Amazon Customer,3,Out of my age group.  I am old.  Probably okay show but we turned off as it was for young at heart.
B0030I61FW,Diane M. Peterson,3,It's a good film for young teens.  if you're over the age of 16 it's cute but that is it.
B0030I61FW,Epiphany,3,Cute for teens maybe... but too many gaps in the plot for me and oddly... incongruous amount of thong views of girls supposedly between the ages of 14 -16.
B0032UQR70,Amazon Customer "Renaissance Man",5,Intelligence and wit.  Unique among the young children's pap that passes for entertainment. Kids love it and parents wont hate it.
B0032UQR70,BL,5,Cute show.  We love the music and the monkey antics.  We enjoy watching it because both the nine month old grandson and the ten year old grandson laugh.
B0032UQR70,C. Martinez,4,A fun kids show that is entertaining for adults to. Who couldn't love that little monkey.  Helps with problem solving.
B0032UQR70,JCruea10,5,Love this show.  I watch it almost daily with my two and seven year old sons!  Good wholesome fun show for little ones!
B0032UQR70,J-Squared,5,this is my son's favorite show for whatever reason . . . .  the opening theme music always gets him extremely excited.
B0032UQR70,M. Engel,5,My baby loves this cartoon. Color are bright and vibrant. I don't like that after she watches it she then starts talking gibberish like George.
B0032UQR70,michaelmap,5,My kids love it.  Watch it almost everyday.  Good and funny.  Keeps them entertained.  Hope they get more season's on Prime.
B0032UQR70,romansjoy,5,This plays daily on our fire tv and kindle!
B0032UQR70,SC,3,The show is good enough. No real value to it but at least it's not overly annoying.  You can put it on and read
B0032UQR70,Seb311,5,Really fun show for kids. My daughter loves it and it's educational. Very safe for kids so you can let them watch it without worrying about anything inappropriate. I'm glad Amazon has this and other children's programming on Amazon Prime. One of the main reasons I use the service.
B00332YHLU,Claudine,5,Such a great show. Love George and his adventures. He always fixes his messes and helps out whenever he can.
B00332YHLU,Jeannie,5,My granddaughter loves Curious George and loves watching all the seasons and episodes over and over again. I highly recommend this series for the toddler group.
B00332YHLU,John Johnson,5,My family is really into Curious George. It is entertaining for our 1 and 3 year old and me and my wife know them all by heart by now. There's interesting things for young and old in here...
B00332YHLU,romansjoy,5,We've watched these over and over again using Fire TV.  My 3 year old just loves this show and can't seem to get enough!
B003336P1Y,michaelmap,5,My kids love curious George.  He teaches as he entertains.  Good for any age group.  I have a 2 and a 7 year old and they both love him.
B003336P1Y,Monica,5,fun and cute. my two yr old loves it. it teaches them about consequences to actions in a very positive light.
B00337ZGIS,Ant C,5,This is a very smart adultoon ( adult cartoon).  Love the innuendo both subtle and blatant.  Worth checking it out
B00337ZGIS,brittany manuel,4,pretty funny animated comedy. could use some new characters though. archer and mallory are my favorites of the show. i haven't seen the latest season but i am looking forward to watching it.
B00337ZGIS,dman,4,Good action and funny situations.It had action.Like a sexy Get Smart. Some real life situations. More real life that get smart.At times thought I was watching a tv show on CBS.
B00337ZGIS,Eric Schneider,3,I am in a restaurant with a drunk friend yelling Lana every 5 seconds so I was compelled to figure out what he was tripping on.  And yes I binged the entire series for some strange reason.  Good show length.  Google the live actors for more fun watching.
B00337ZGIS,flygirltaylor,5,I don't watch this series but my son purchased this so he could pass time on the airplane.  This was a win-win for both of us.  He kept from getting bored and I got to finish some work while he watched the video.
B00337ZGIS,Joseph B. Powell,5,It is one of the best mature audience animations out there.  The back and forth between characters is great.  Archer takes it another level always trying to get over and one liners are hilarious.
B00337ZGIS,Kbaby59,5,The Doctor is pure nonsense and I really enjoyed it. Rose is a great addition to the show.She is great.
B00337ZGIS,Larry Parker,5,It's not porno but it does have adult themes. I found it funny and entertaining. I did buy this blind having not seen the show on FX. The reviews were great and the theme sounded different. I was not disappointed and soon bought 2 more seasons..
B00337ZGIS,Lynn Ellingwood "The ESOL Teacher",4,I've seen ads for this show on FX forever and never bothered to watch until I ran out of new TV episodes to catch up on with Amazon Prime. Then I turned to Archer to see what this show had to offer. It is an adult animated feature about a spy agency during the Cold War era. It is so funny and very enjoyable. I am now a solid fan of the show.
B00337ZGIS,Lyns the cook,5,I love this show. They did so well on the animation and h Jon Benjamin is amazing and hilarious. Awesome!
B00337ZGIS,Richie,5,Archer is an adult cartoon show. Archer is a Secret Agent and works for his Mother along with a gang of misfits. I could do without some of the language but otherwise it is a great show.
B00337ZGIS,Tara "Tara",5,What a great adult themed cartoon.  It is along the lines of Family Guy only with more adult content.  I laugh so hard every time I watch this.
B00337ZGIS,w.Biedermann,4,Archer is an adult cartoon that is snuggle on the couch with the hubby and a good mellow drink and laugh till you cry.
B0033YX6ZQ,Darlene Walker,5,I love watching this show it is very interesting and I learn something about keeping safe. I love shows like this
B0033YX6ZQ,Kindle Customer,4,This is a very interesting show.  I like the real-life stories.  Definitely entertaining and I'll be watching more for sure.
B0033YX6ZQ,whatnot,5,This true based show lets the consumer aware of &#34;what could happen&#34; to you or loved ones. We are notmedia informed about how large this problem is. Avid watcher!
B0035GNSPA,lee,4,i say 80% of the episodes of this season is awesome. I watched most of I almost got away with it already.
B003627X4U,Diva,5,I liked this. The fish come right out at times and the color was amazing. my only complaint is that it was really short. I could have watched it for a few more hours! :)
B003627X4U,JMV,4,It has very impresive 3D picture in it.... still some of the scenes are not as good and it can be alittle boring a times... still I think is a very informative docummentary and it's worth at least 4 stars
B00366JI9O,B.C. "Defend Liberty",5,I've enjoyed each and every episode.  Extremely well crafted and acted.  We need more quality programming like this; this sets the bar high.
B00366JI9O,DD "DD",5,Part of fun of this show is the realism. The scenery; the old vehicles; the buildings;  the rural areas and even the police station although they closed the old station. The cast is great and actually look like real people. The mysteries are fun to watch although the guilty party(s) is/are usually not one of the main suspects. All-in-all this whole series is a great.
B00366JI9O,flyfish,5,The stories are always engaging and the era ( WWII) interests me..Foyles driver brings unique point of view to the story line.
B00366JI9O,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,I love this season.  It has seven in all. watching it very entertaining. Good great wonderful amazingDr George Tomes
B00366JI9O,inspectorudy,4,This is a great series that shows a lot about wartime England and the issues that plagued the &#34;Home Front&#34;. It is not a violence filled or sex parade like its American counterparts but it is interesting and doesn't beat you over the head with stupid plots.
B00366JI9O,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,An excellent enthralling series made so by an ensemble that just makes it happen in what seems such an easier manner.  They bring us back to a sullen time and make us part of this history all over again in such an entertaining way without the rose colored plots that could sink a series of this nature quickly.
B00366JI9O,Joan Bachman,5,I lot this show but then I love a great many of the British series both the comedies as well as the mysteries.  Keep them coming.
B00366JI9O,Jo Ann Massaro,5,Each episode of this series is well done and interesting. I am hooked on this series and am dreading it ending. The actors are superb. The casting could not have been better. Foyle is an intelligent and thoughtful person who gets to the truth by being observant of the little things surrounding each case. He also has a soft heart and a determination to do the right thing.
B00366JI9O,Julzweaver "Julzweaver",5,I love the setting; both in time and placement. The costuming is wonderful and the subject matter always appears believable.
B00366JI9O,Katharine S. Dupre "Writer & Book Lover",5,I like the especially accurate scene that is portrayed in the films and the plots are excellent. The actors are also very good.
B00366JI9O,kathryn,5,This is an excellent series capturing the feel of privation and the constant threat of invasion over several early war years.  The acting is outstanding.
B00366JI9O,Kay Beth Stavley,5,I love this series and do not want it to end!  I sort of use it as a reward for finishing my goal for the day!
B00366JI9O,KTL,5,My wife and I thoroughly enjoy this series. The best of all is that you can watch it on Amazon Prime for free. It is full of history too.
B00366JI9O,Muffy Dreyfuss "Muffy",5,Foyle's War has excellent actors and story lines. It's a &#34;do not miss&#34; in our home. Watch it sooner rather than later.
B00366JI9O,Nancy Gambrell,5,I have enjoyed this show very much I also enjoy show's that are of  WWII time. And I find it interesting hearing some of there their views of Americans being there.
B00366JI9O,Nancy G. Hutchison "addicted to mysteries",5,I love this series.  Series 3 reveals more about what went on in England during World War II.  Great acting by the cast!
B00366JI9O,Pamela M. Johnson,5,Love Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks!  This is a terrific series..a real period piece that opens a window into history..
B00366JI9O,Pamela "pvs",5,Smart and free of junk.... really enjoy the solving of problems. A must see for those who love mysteries. Watch it.
B00366JI9O,S. M. Lott "MovieMusic",5,More of the WW II situation for those at home in Britian.  Interesting how they view the &#34;Yanks.&#34;Worth your time.
B00366JI9O,Steve P,4,Hurrah for the BBC! The Amazon Prime membership has opened all sots of doors to viewing shows that unless I watched PBS (and was lucky enough to stop and watch the show) I would have never viewed. This is a great show with great characters and strong stories.
B00366JI9O,Sudsy,5,Outstanding show. Actors are realistic. Plots so different from usual TV shows. An interesting look at England during a time befroe most of us were very young or not even born.
B00366JI9O,Wayne Best,4,Want to see what the English really thought of the 'Yanks'?  Good mysteries and interesting history.  My wife and I are hooked.
B0036D8LPO,Amorette,5,I always enjoy Poirot.  He never fails to discover who the culprit is in his episodes.  The fashion of that time is interesting. I love his character in the stories.
B0036D8LPO,CO GIRL,5,I've always liked reading Agatha Christie but I'm enthralled with David Suchet as Poirot.  I like the deductive reasoning and the scenery is so amazing and filming techniques are wonderful.
B0036D8LPO,D. Gundling,5,Seasons one through six are my very favorite because they were able to weave in some sly humor and there was a great supporting cast.  These earlier seasons are far superior to the later seasons (9-12) which do not include the supporting cast or delicate innuendos that make Poirot so memorable.  And yet they are all good.  It is just that seasons one through six are great.
B0036D8LPO,Katharine S. Dupre "Writer & Book Lover",5,I love the puzzles these Agatha Christie movies present partly because the director and the actors are so good.
B0036D8LPO,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,Great stories and excellent acting. The setting is England (primarily) in the thirties. Every time I watch this or any of the other Poirot series I am amazed at the mannerisms of David Suchet and how his character never changes (to any great extent). Watch this series and you will most likely watch all Poirot's adventures.
B0036D8LPO,Lisa_Minneapolis,5,Wonderfully dry humor and great acting by the entire cast.  A great period piece with beautiful scenery and clothes to die for.
B0036D8LPO,LR,5,My addicton to Agatha Christie and Cavid Suchet has been appeased - for a while.  I can watch him every day and never tire of his reactions to suspects.  Don't expect reality.  Sit back and enjoy.
B0036D8LPO,Mary Spangler,5,Poirot  is one of my favorite Agatha Christie's characters. David Suchet makes the character come alive . Never a dull moment.
B0036D8LPO,Millicent Washington "Mickey",5,One of my favorite detectives - He doesn't drive or like violence. Does not carry a gun and doesn't take down the bad guys with his physical strength. He's just Poirot solving cases of National Importance with the psychology.
B0036D8LPO,NM Shadow "NM Shadow",5,Well done adaptation with excellent actors bringing the characters to life. The lack of fund raising interruptions or commercials adds greatly to the enjoyment.
B0036D8LPO,shirley,5,Great videos. Hate to see them end. I will watch these over and over and find something I may have missed the first time.
B0036D8LPO,Suzi Girl,5,Loved the first 5 in the series and this was great too. I strongly recommend the series. David Suchet is marvelous.
B0036D8LPO,Xrahdio,5,Five minutes into the series I realized I had already viewed all of them. The perfection of Suchet's performances coupled with the consummate attention to detail observed by the production company prompted me to watch them all again. Superb!!
B0036D8M9E,Amorette,5,I love all the episodes of Poirot.  He is so amusing and entertaining.  I like Poirot's funny moustache; he is quite a character.
B0036D8M9E,Book Lover "CYN",5,I love series 5 of the Poirot series. We learn a lot about Poirot as a young policeman and detective. We learn how he got the silver lapel pin he always wears. I believe he was in love. It is a great series and David Suchet does a wonderful job. I highly recommend this series to all Agatha Christie lovers.
B0036D8M9E,casanne,5,I will love poirot always.  David Suchet is the best. Please add more seasons to prime as well as miss marple also.
B0036D8M9E,Donald E. Silva,5,I love this series! I've watched every episode twice and am on my third viewing. There simply isn't anything to compare. I've watched Poirot acted by different actors for a few of the episodes. They are alright but nothing to get excited about. David Suchet plays the part of Hercule with impeccable taste and accuracy. He captures the character with every gesture. It is a real pleasure to watch the master at his craft.
B0036D8M9E,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",5,Miss Lemon and Chief Inspector Jepp are back and the timing is back to 50 minutes. Very Manageable to watch.
B0036D8M9E,Gerald G.,5,I simply find the series very entertaining! The stories usually catch my attention and hold my interest all the way thru. Bravo!
B0036D8M9E,Joanne,5,We have always enjoyed all of Poirot's episodes - Agatha Christie is a writer of the top quality.  Never disappointing.
B0036D8M9E,mary,4,i like the colorful settings on this show and it is not to gross or bloody just mostly who done it type
B0036D8M9E,Millicent Washington "Mickey",4,great great great - I love and watched just about all episodes - I wish there were more. Just call a and Poirot bucket-head  LOL
B0036D8M9E,M. Webster "None",5,I love the little dectective.  I have enjoyed all of thisw series.  It is not filled with words I do not want my grandchildren to hear and use.  It doesn't have a lot of violence and sexual scenes.
B0036D8M9E,Paja,5,Love watching him put those little gray cells to work
B0036D8M9E,P. Alexander "savyshopper",4,I choose four stars because the show is consistently entertaining. I don't lose interest. It is not the very best show I've ever seen but it is always good.
B0036D8M9E,raten51,5,I really enjoy watching Poirot the way he talks and walks and how humorous he is. The show is very entertaining and Poirot always gets the bad guy's or bad ladies. 5 stars for Poirot.
B0036D8M9E,shirley,5,Best entertainment. There should be more of these kinds of series today. I hope they make more in Poirot's old age!
B0036D8M9E,Stacy Joura,5,David Suchet is the best actor I've seen portray Agatha Christie's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.  I love the art deco sets and costumes.  The video quality is very good.  I enjoy seeing Christie's stories come to life.
B0036D8M9E,Suzi Girl,5,I love this series. The episodes just keep getting better and the consistency is wonderful. The cast is great and I just love the series.
B0036D8M9E,Terrijean,5,Clever and amusing with just a touch of intrigue. Costuming and historically accurate. Does Agatha Christi proud. SUCHET is grand!
B0036DCJCU,Book Lover "CYN",5,I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot and the PBS  programs are wonderful. David Suchet is a marvelous Poirot and plays him masterfully. It is a pleasure to watch these programs and I highly recommend them to any Poirot fan.
B0036DCJCU,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",5,Sometimes an actor can go stale in a series but not David Suchet. He is as strong as at the start. These episodes are longer (1.75 hrs) than the usual ones - they must have been 2 partes on Masterpirece Mystery.
B0036DCJCU,james-from-houston,5,I am elated when they began releasing Poirot in Blue-Ray. You can't go wrong with this.Keep 'em coming..I want them all!
B0036DCJCU,J. Gabrielson,5,There is only ONE Poirot and his name is David Suchet. Kudos to the other members of the ensemble cast which make this series perfect.
B0036DCJCU,Joan,4,This season is not up to my expectations as there are not enough movies included in it compared to the other seasons. The shows themselves are excellent as usual.
B0036DCJCU,Julzweaver "Julzweaver",5,The bit of extra time per episode made this season just that much more exceptional! Again the costuming and set decoration was amazing!
B0036DCJCU,Leah,5,I love the simplicity of this detective. He reminds me of Sherlock Holmes except he keeps things to himself until the end. He is also a French Belgin that does not think much of English food.
B0036DCJCU,Mesquite "Patsy Strode",5,Agatha Christie must have had David Suchet in mind to play the part of Poirot when she wrote her books. The whole cast is perfect. Suchet gets his point across with a raised eyebrow or a frown or whatever suits the situation. The rest of the players are great support for the whole show.
B0036DCJCU,Millicent Washington "Mickey",5,One of all time favorite detectives - Love all episodes - wish there were more. No one can outsmart Poirot.
B0036DCJCU,Muffy Dreyfuss "Muffy",5,Agatha Christie hasn't been popular all the years for nothing!  David Suchet bring Poirot into vivid focus time and again.
B0036DCJCU,nelly123,5,Love this series and love poirot strange little man but great storylines and love trying to work it out before poirot
B0036DCJCU,T.C.,5,All of the Poirot Series with David Suchet playing Poirot are the best ever filmed.  Highly recommended for lovers of British mystery series.
B0036DCJKW,Amorette,5,I always like to watch Poirot episodes.  He is so amusing and such an interesting man playing the detective in these videos. I love looking at the fashions and old cars.  And it is fun to watch these episodes unfold.
B0036DCJKW,BargainHunter,5,I can hardly finish watching before my husband takes over.  We both love them all and will continue to watch.
B0036DCJKW,Dgst "Gitte Strauss",5,Each episode is as good or better than the last. The plots are so well thought out and always manage to surprise at the end. An excellent choice for any mystery buff.
B0036DCJKW,D. Gundling,5,Season 2  continue to grow in complexity and smart storylines.  I love the immaculate historical setting for this series in 1920s - 1930's England.  Anyone who likes mysteries will enjoy such a high quality british based series.  Poirot is from Belgium but it is enjoyable that everyone keeps thinking he is a Frenchman in England.
B0036DCJKW,eighth,5,Perfect gentleman; proper manners with intelligence in solving crimes with his &#34;little grey cells &#34;; Miss Lemon ; Deputy inspector Japp and colonel Hastings Poirot's posse.
B0036DCJKW,Elaine Gowder,5,Agatha Christie's Poirot stories are just  the right note for a late night viewing before going to sleep or on a rainy afternoon.  The stories always keep my interest even though I have seen them more than once.  People who have read and enjoyed the books will enjoy the videos.
B0036DCJKW,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",5,Although Peter Ustinov played Hercule in a movie as did someone else (that I forget) - he is the perfect Poirot. And the episode where he retires and leaves everything up to Hastings is really entertaining. Every episode is a winner - even though this was made 20 some years ago.
B0036DCJKW,Joan,5,You will always get a high rating from me for any Agatha Christie book that has Hercule Poirot as the main character.
B0036DCJKW,Joanne,5,Do enjoy Poirot - we watch them often.  Only problem is in that some of them. the video freezes - then a complicated process of returning to the particular video.  Believe I have to go to th Help site for that problemWorth watching.
B0036DCJKW,Julzweaver "Julzweaver",5,David Suchet is amazing as Poirot! I can't imagine anyone better. The set direction and costuming are over the top!
B0036DCJKW,Katharine S. Dupre "Writer & Book Lover",5,I hate unnecessary violence so I enjoy a good Agatha Christie Poirot murder mystery because of the excellent plotting without the unnecessary violence. Her plots are about solving the puzzle with all the important clues included.
B0036DCJKW,L. Grueneberg,5,I am looking forward to watching all the years of the series that are on Amazon Prime.  He knows how to solve a crime.  It often seems that all the pieces fall together at just the right time and he dazzles us with his insight.
B0036DCJKW,Mallory,5,Please get the rest of the series  thanks youDavid Suchet is the ONLY Poirot......  You will enjoy itThank You aMAZON
B0036DCJKW,Mesquite "Patsy Strode",5,Good clean shows. Even the murders are neat and clean. You can never  guess who done it. Hope to see more of the same in the future.
B0036DCJKW,Michael L. Lowenstein,5,An English detective series very well written and a fine cast of actors. Most of the shows will keep your interest as you don't know the culprit till the end.
B0036DCJKW,Millicent Washington "Mickey",5,Love his character...and series. Cases of national importance. Hastings and Ms Lemon are perfect in their roles as well. Good stuff.
B0036DCJKW,Patricia A. Jones "Bookworm",5,Poirot is the ultimate detective.  David Suchet makes him so believable.  I love Captain Hastings and the secretary too.  Jolly
B0036DCJKW,P. Bates,4,I thought I had already seen all of the Poirot episodes but these were new to me and I enjoyed them very much.
B0036DCJKW,P. Street,5,Poirot's quirky personality is as fascinating as the mysteries that he solves.  The &#34;art deco&#34; decor scattered throughout the scenes is interesting too.
B0036DCJKW,R. Gilbert,5,Excellent acting and production values and what is so great about these is that they are faithful to the stories and have a Poirot who is the ultimate Poirot.
B0036DCJKW,shirley,5,There should be more of these kinds of series. Agatha Chritie is brilliant portraying her mysteries. Hercule Poirot is an amazing detectve with all his quirks. The more you watch..the more you know what his facial expressions mean.
B0036DCJKW,Wayne Best,4,My wife is a big fan of Agatha Christie and particularly Poirot.  The 51 minute length fits nicely between regular TV shows.  The quality is fine.
B0037KH0WQ,Barbara G. Michonski,5,My grand daughter who is 20 months loves this show. She stops whatever she is doing and runs in to watch it.
B0037KH0WQ,beth and chris,5,i am the dad that loves this show as much as my kids (4 and 2). I wish all seasons were included with amazon prime.
B0037KH0WQ,bobbi,5,My 2 yr old grandson loves watching this show. Thanks for sharing this programing through Amazon Prime. We will continue to watch it.
B0037KH0WQ,C. Heness "lizziebetliz",5,Cute characters and uses counting and shapes for their adventures.  It's a good show when I want my granddaughter to take a break.
B0037KH0WQ,Christine Vogelsang,5,Great show for preschoolers.  My grandchildren love it! Emphasizes friendship and helping friends and those in need.  Focuses on math skills including patterns and measurement.
B0037KH0WQ,C. McKay "jewelry godess",5,My 4yr old Daughter used to watch this when we had cable.  We have Amazon Prime instead and was so glad to see this added!  She loves watching it.  Great show for young minds!
B0037KH0WQ,Gram,4,My Grandson very much enjoys this cute show. It is a nice clean show that seem very well done for young kids.
B0037KH0WQ,Honey Solomon,5,There are definitely advantages to being a grandparent! Colorful and fun way to learn shapes and numbers while teaching cooperation. Recommended for ages 2 - 5.
B0037KH0WQ,marymurban,5,Fun little movie that you used to be able to find on regular television in the past. Grandchildren enjoy it and learn from it.
B0037KH0WQ,Melanie C Wiitanen,4,My kids love this show! It's fun and the kids learn social skills and problem solving.We had no problems with streaming it on our smart TV.
B0037KH0WQ,M. Engel,5,My 3 ur old loves this group of characters. They are bright colored full of happy energy. She laying snuggled in bed and watches laughing and giggling and yelling at he screen.Thank you
B0037KH0WQ,M. Skiles "r_vin",5,This little cartoon is my son's favorite show right now!  It has a plus of being educational as well as entertaining. There's a lot about math and counting.
B0037KH0WQ,patriciavonhartmann,5,This series about little elf-like kids is entertaining as well as teaching younger ones how to work together and solve problems. Good preschool show!
B0037KH0WQ,R. Joshi "R. Joshi",5,Really nice educational program. Both kids 4 and 6 love to watch this.My daughter loves to learn math with team Umizoomi.
B0037KH0WQ,Rod,5,This is a great show for children in pre-k or even younger. It really helps introduce counting and small arithmetic operations such as adding and subtracting small numbers. The characters are very kid friendly and their adventures involve real people as well as other animated characters. You cannot go wrong with this show!
B0037KH0WQ,txjaywalker,5,My grandson enjoys and will request this series.  The characters portray being helpful and making good choices.  Nice to see something that reinforces values!
B0037L6BHK,Adair,5,Haven't watched the show in a long time. It's still fun to watch. I'm glad it got add to prime.
B0037L6BHK,Big A "Wesley",5,This is a classic cartoon from my teen years. My wife and I love watching it and were so excited that the whole series is on Amazon Prime.
B0037L6BHK,J. Gabrielson,5,I even had one best friend who was an artist. Daria is timeless. There will always be young women like Daria and Jane in high school wishing they were somewhere else. I watch to have a chuckle at the absurdities of social interactions which never change down through the generations.
B0037L6BHK,Kim,4,I am not sure what got me watching this show when I found it on Prime but glad I did.  I like to come home from work and after I get some stuff done around the house then its time to relax with a couple episodes of Daria.
B0037L6BHK,Larry Parker,5,I started watching this series on cable. Caustic social commentary and biting humor. Over the top! Worth a watch! It's that good.
B0037L6BHK,Romona Burton,1,This series was not as funny or interesting as I remember it to be.  I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage
B0037L6BHK,Valerie Tucker,5,This is a favorite of mine from years past that I still enjoy.  It makes me laugh a lot and I enjoy it.  I don't really usually watch cartoons after raising my children but this a great show.
B0037NCNF2,Henrietta Stackpole,5,I'm so glad I can &#34;binge watch&#34; every season of the Sopranos on Amazon.  I missed many of the original episodes and it's like a homecoming to get back into the complex story line.  Still one of the best shows on TV.  Ever.
B0037NCNF2,Larry Poffenberger "rustytool",5,I finally got around to watching this series an really enjoyed it.  The acting was superb and the story line fascinating.
B0037NCNF2,Michael,5,One of the best seasons of one of the best TV series ever. Love that the entire series is now available through Amazon Prime.
B0037NCNF2,Richee,5,I have seen the Complete series a couple of times.  Every couple of years or so.  It's a Great Show.  But the ending is just Crap. It was a Very Controversial ending.
B0037NCNF2,Steven Roach,5,I n season 6 all of the actors showed there true ability to out perform in a dynamic show like the Sopranos.
B0038KNRAO,Marie "Marie",5,I find it amazing how these women sacrifice their lives for these men that are in for the long haul.  They must have very low opinion of themselves or don't like to have to answer to someone everyday at home.
B0038KNRAO,Michael,5,Prison wives sheds light on the other half of a prison sentence. My wife and I both enjoyed watching every episode in this series. These women take commitment to a whole other level.
B0038L1XPO,Ashley Thomas,5,I love how this show is realistic with today's family issues. Every time I watch an episode I feel inspired and happy. Love this series.
B0038L1XPO,Ellyn M. Renken,5,You can see your own family in this show!  Life-like situations we all face when raising and communicating with family and children.
B0038L1XPO,Jessica Rose Howell,5,I have seen in a long while.  This show is a drama but full of feeling and emotion that many of us encounter in our family lives.
B0038L1XPO,JJ,5,This is truly family fare!  Real life problems on the screen!  Recommend for the whole family.  The whole thing is very sweet!
B0038L1XPO,Laura Roberts "Krazy Kat Lady",5,A great family show. Love all the actors & characters. I really am hooked on this show. Glad I have Amazon Prime.
B0038L1XPO,Lynnie "Ausblonde",5,I purchased this after watching a couple of episodes on Television thinking that it might just be OK to watch during the Summer months when nothing much is on (Australian Summer).  What a surprise I received - this is an excellent programme - better than most.  The casting is right on the money.  The storylines while being real and honest still manage to include humour.  The only thing wrong with this series is that there are only thirteen episodes.  I will be counting down the days until the next series is released and I am hoping that the show is extended to twenty two episodes.
B0038L1XPO,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,Another netflix show that got me to buying the seasons! I didn't think I would like it but I love it! I can't wait til the 4th season and Netflix gets that!
B0038L1XPO,PJ,4,The pilot was pretty bad but the episodes got better and better as the characters developed. I'm now on season 2 and really enjoying it.
B0038L1XPO,T. J. Foster,5,I love the way this show successfully carries several plot lines and then will intertwine them at moments and bring all of the characters together. Great show. I wish Amazon would work on their streaming interface though...frustrating to have to add separate seasons to watch.
B0038ZEWY4,Nancy E. Gallagher,5,I really like cops shows and Southland has engaging characters along with action.  The internal conflict for the characters is quite good.  Regina King is marvelous.
B0038ZEWY4,sam,5,I am hooked on the series.  Loved the interaction between the officers and the characters of the inner city streets.
B0038ZEWY4,SusieQ "Carwalker",5,Southland is a good crime drama. It makes you feel for the characters.It feels real. Police dramas that tells all sides of the issues are worth watching.
B003925164,Amazon Customer,5,This show is perfectly suited toward youngsters who don't need the over stimulation of ridiculous shows like SpongeBob and the ilk.
B003925164,camdonella,5,I have always lived the little bear books so I love this show.  It is very uplifting and I prefer it over some of theory trendy kids shows.  It is timeless.
B003925164,gregory,2,I don't really love Little Bear because it looks ok that was so very angry and I really hate this show
B003925164,L. Wickline,5,My kids enjoy watching this show when they're feeling cruddy with a cold- the stories are sweet! Not hard for me to sit through either :)
B003925164,Mark and Lindsay,5,Wholesome and imaginative catroon for the children and adults alike. My daughters love to watch as Little Bear has adventures with his friends.
B003925164,Sheree "Shar",5,My children enjoyed these video very much.  The videos are very entertaining and educational.  The lenght of the video is perfect.
B003925164,Staci,5,A very nice show for young children to watch.  My three year old loves these shows and it is so much better than some of the programs out there today.
B003AI2E8K,Chefgrandma,5,Diego is a teaching tool for my 4 year old granddaughter. She has watched every episode and repeats much of the stories to me.
B003AI2E8K,Prentice House "LEE",5,My four year old grandbaby absolutely loves Diego.  She can't get enough and learns well from the format.  Well done.
B003AI9Y7Y,ddrevia,5,Little ones can associate well with the day to day fun and problems. It helps them figure things out. Like remember little bill did that
B003AI9Y7Y,gregory,5,this show teaches kids so much.  its great fun at home and in school and the generations of family are wonderful
B003AI9Y7Y,Stephanie J. Trillo,5,We love watching these and I love how their is a bit of adult/parent humor. &#34;Why are you fixing the bike?&#34;  &#34;Because the only thing your father can fix is a sandwich.&#34; Classic. Instant love. I really like that it helps teach the kids about diversity too.
B003AIE43I,Daizy72,5,Little Bill is a family favorite. The program centers around Little Bill and his daily adventures. There are good lessons big and small to be learned and they're not all by Little Bill as may be the case for other shows. All family members and friends are involved.
B003AIE43I,gregory,5,all episodes and all seasons are total enjoyment teaching kids about so many of life's little lessons.  your kids will love it
B003AIE43I,Karin Gaffney,5,My 3 year old loves this show and often sings the songs. I love the lessons and multi-cultural and ethnic characters.
B003AVGMV2,Christ's Soldier,4,I KNOW THEY BASED IT ON A TRUE STORY BUT SOMTETIMES I REALLY HATE REALITY AND JUST LIKE A GOOD MOVIE THEY SHOULD HAVE SAID BASED ON A TRUE STORY AND JUST MADE IT A HAPPY ENDING.
B003B1TF2E,F. Harshbarger "fh",4,I really want to see the whole movie for free on prime before this year's subscription runs out.  Amazon!?!?!? Well?
B003B1TF2E,Ronald Dillenburg "Ron D",4,Great and funny concept. The background material from this featurette will make seeing the movie much more for older viewers.
B003B1TF2E,S. Wallace,4,If you are entertaining your small kids this won't scare them and it will make them laugh.  If you are entertaining big kids my age (58 years) it won't scare them and it will make them laugh.  The director knows what tickles your funny bone.  I loved this movie.
B003B4SH5M,Jen Sites,5,I had forgotten how great this show was. I start watching this show when it first came on. Then because of work and other stuff I missed the last 3 seasons.
B003B4SH5M,J. Ligon "JimL",5,The continuing saga of a socially inept marshal holds my interest and is worthwhile entertainment. Interesting characters in captivating situations.
B003B4SH5M,K. Marlow "Kat",5,Great service arrived before the pre-determined time and in the condition promised did not have any issues and did not contact the retailer
B003B4SH5M,Lincoln County MT "Focused on pinecones",5,We Binged watched this whole series from year 1 through year 4.5. Really loved the writing and the actors. Almost addictive and just wish it had managed to keep going a few more years...as into at least 7 full years. But it is what it was and that was very very good the whole show went out on top and in good standing. But like a good book when it's over it's over. Onto find something else. We don't get cable/satelite so rely on the DVD's and great reviewers from fans here on Amazon to figure out what we might like and enjoy. Someone reviewing The Closer mentioned this show and so glad I took their suggestion up. I can't recommend one season over the other as they were all just great and pretty much as good across the board. It was a bit disconcerning when the younger females kept going through pregnancies and their figures changed considerably but the show handled it well and really todays world they pretty much go with the flow and except for some creative shots and clothing aimed not to point it out they do pretty good. I'll miss Mary and her side kick and glad they didn't ever put them together...good for the writers and directors and makers of this show.
B003B4SH5M,Mary "Mary",5,Mary McCormick and Fred Weller are excellent together.  The story lines are captivating and easily holds your interest.  Great series!
B003B4SH5M,Richard "Dickie",2,I have now seen the first two dvd's of season three. It's not good. I gave the first two years five stars. It now gets two. Even the music is bad. The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled. No wonder.
B003B4SH5M,sewready,4,Whit and sarcasim rule this series. Mary McCormack is great. I have enjoyed every episode and recommend is to everyone.
B003B63FKW,Bevvie,5,Loved it wish there were more seasons...... I like anything that has to do with history ....but in a story type.. I think you learn more ...it was awesome....
B003B63FKW,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,It kind of weird you say to yourself "I know from history how this is going to end.." Seeing the events in an emotional context bring new life and interest to those historical facts. In other words you are still surprised when something happens. When the whims of a single man can affect the destiny of the known world or even more interesting how an influential woman might have had that much influence you just want to watch. The production is beautiful and high quality.
B003B63FKW,Devora,5,I had watched this on cable and missed season 2 for whatever reason. Now I have re-watched season 1 and watched season 2 in a marathon viewing one rainy day boy I really enjoyed this. Sorry there will be no more a shame.
B003B63FKW,grant18,2,I'll admit that I only watched a little of this but the violence was beyond my acceptable level so I quit.
B003B63FKW,gregg dunn,2,Only watched one episode. it was too political for my taste. but i'll give another chance after I finish Game of Thrones.
B003B63FKW,j,4,Very well made with accurate history and sets. Direction is top notch as well as the acting. I enjoy history.
B003B63FKW,John Boone,1,I agree with other comments about how this video is not good for the family to watch.  Moral values of this film are very poor.I did not even get very far into the movie before seeing way too much sex and nudity. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with moral values.
B003B63FKW,Knight68 "EM",4,This show is great.  The historical setting the true to life characterization and the brutality of that era are all realistic.  It smacks in the face of those who continually talk about the good old days.  Corruption and mendacity are a part of history .  When we look at it not much has changed --the larger the government the more corrupt it is.knight68
B003B63FKW,Larry Snider,2,First program in series was OK but not great. Evaluation will depend on whether we watch other programs in series
B003B63FKW,Max Mustang,5,The complete series is available. Historically correct almost with an interesting back story.  An adult series with a fine cast.If you like quasi-historic drama you'll really enjoy this extravaganza.
B003B63FKW,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",5,I enjoy period pieces. The Rome episodes are very enjoyable. Some portions are very gory but other portions are fun. I'm looking forward to Season 2.
B003B63FKW,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,If i could give this ten stars I would.  I couldn't stop watching this.  I watched all three within a few days and was so upset when it ended!
B003BF1ZRI,Big A "Wesley",5,If you love cynicism and wit then Daria is the show for you. In season 2 the creative team behind Daria take the show to another level. They go deeper into the world of a high school teen as seen through the judgmental eyes of Daria.
B003BF1ZRI,Dan Hangen,4,This was a fantastic show.  It was witty and clever.  The characters and storyline were perfect.  This is an oldie but a goodie.
B003BF1ZRI,mayzey "d.littin",5,I am old enough that I grew up on cartoons. I read comic books. I am not a fan of the computer image in most series. The art that is Daria reminds me of my first memories of what is now called an &#34;animated&#34; series.  What makes me watch it is the writing and characters. I started watching tv in the 50's. I have watched animation for many years. I know what I like and I like Daria.
B003BF1ZRI,mork1966,4,Daria is hilarious in a weird geeky way. It is like insight to what a nerd feels and is treated.
B003BOQVF0,casanne,5,I love shows like this one that show you the thought process behind the masterpiece.  Very informative.  It would be nice if more shows like this could be created like maybe abiut Charles Dickens or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
B003BOQVF0,meg,5,It took me some time to get used to the mix of modern day and early Times. But it was a great idea. I enjoyed every episode and would recommend this series. There was few slow moments but it kept my interest had it not then I wouldn't have purchased or watched all the parts.
B003BOQVF0,MM,5,This is such an interesting concept for a story. Really enjoyed it. No something I couldn't get enough of but seem to always goback for more.
B003BOWF64,brittany manuel,4,I chose 4 stars because I liked the show but there should have been more episodes in the season. I purchased it because I am a fan of Ray WInstone. I would recommend it to people who enjoy watching British murder mystery shows.
B003BOWF64,REGRETFUL,4,interesting characters and stories.
B003BYDUPY,Daizy72,5,Blue's Clues is a wonderfully engaging show for pre-schoolers. There's an educational theme to each half hour show and the host involves the viewers in the fun and games.
B003BYDUPY,E B Fricks,5,Blues is a super sweet TV show for kids! The best part is it's not so annoying that you go nuts. It's actually cute and entertaining.
B003BYDUPY,gregory,5,I really love to watch this show all time.  my mom has bought every episode that's available on instant video for me
B003BYDUPY,HannahLynn,5,thanks to prime membership I can watch these!my sis and I watched this show with kids we used to nanny for and now I watch it with my daughter.
B003BYDUPY,surgidude,5,my young great grandson loves this app.  he watches for hours and thoroughly enjoys it.  glad to see him so engrossed.
B003CWHG8M,Paul Stewart,5,This season was hilarious to me because of the all of the coon episodes. I got a good deal on it and this season was honestly one of the better seasons in quite some years.
B003CWHG8M,tigerfire2002,1,This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.
B003D6IRP8,Gigi123,3,I like the concept ... Really great ideas and positive thoughts and encouragement for kids 5 yrs and up so ckmit out.
B003D6IRP8,LOUISE,5,I got this for my granddaughter. she loved it. she sat and watched it over and over and would get more of these videos the next time she visits.
B003D6IRP8,mom12,3,I don't know if I ever received this product so I can't comment on the quality of it. will have to check it out
B003DNTEBC,Belizelovely,5,This show is adorable. My son loves to sing the theme song and enjoys the adventures in this season as well. Glad that it's free as well.
B003DNTEBC,B. Kelley,5,It's a cute little show from what I've seen.  My kid will sing along with the intro.  They always rescue an animal in trouble.  Some of the ideas for rescuing are actually pretty clever for a kids show.
B003DNTEBC,Christine Vogelsang,5,Great show for preschoolers.  My 2 year old twin grandchildren love it and it teaches how to be a helper.
B003DNTEBC,Cindy Flowers,5,My 2 year old loves the &#34;Wu Pets&#34; as he calls them.  He wanders around the house impersonating the Big bad wolf from the save the three little pigs episode all day.
B003DNTEBC,Rosanne Dutzer,5,My grandson loves Wonder Pets and I love listening to him sing the song.  He's going to be 3 in March and he just loves watching the animals and even dances to the music.  He says it makes him happy!
B003DZ3AJ2,Amazon Customer "Busy Person",5,I am so jealous that I don't get to have a job like this. It wouldn't be Sunday without an episode of MythBusters. Rarely do I disagree with their methods of testing the myths.
B003DZ3AJ2,Preacher Morris,5,I have loved this show ever since the first episode.  I love how two/ now five &#34;regular guys&#34; use science to explore our world in an entertaining way.
B003DZ3AJ2,Some Guy,5,I think I've seen every episode of Mythbusters but I always enjoy watching some of their older episodes especially when there is so little on regular TV worth watching anymore.
B003E8ZYGK,Anne Nguyen,2,Slightly annoying...the typical stuff you would expect from this kind of genre. I wish nickelodeon would put out more original shows.
B003E8ZYGK,Customer,1,This tv show is so bad it is virtually unwatchable. The characters are horrible at acting and stupid. The plots are boring and uneventful. And it is not the slightest bit funny. This show is nothing more than the average boring generic sitcom trash that is on nickelodeon these days. Don't waste your money.
B003E8ZYGK,John J. Schubert "Schubej",4,My grandchildren have watched this and ICarly and I reluctantly watched as well.  I found that both programs were entertaining and fresh.  Victorious adds the musical element to supplement the light hearted humor.  Definitely not bound for an Emmy but still the silliness is infectious.
B003E8ZYGK,MaxJ,5,This is a good clean show for young people.  Finally a show with teens who can actually sing.  The stories are Some what silly but they are entertaining.
B003E8ZYGK,vickie,5,This is a good season for preteens.  My kids watched it over and over again.  I am considering buying season 2
B003ECUGHI,Michael Cooper,1,This movies was okay if you're really into zombies and watch every zombie movie that comes out. I've seen a lot better.
B003EY62H4,Amazon Customer,5,This was exceptional for the three to six year old.  The grand kids still insist to watch each cartoon over and over. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B003EY62H4,Chefgrandma,5,We love Little Bear! He is so sweet and his playmates have delightful personalities! Can't wait to watch season three!
B003EY62H4,ddrevia,5,myself and my grand babies love watching the day to day activities between little bear and his family and friends. It's very peaceful and relaxing.
B003EY62H4,gregory,1,Because we don't like it because it has rain because I did not like it didn't like that show no.
B003EY62H4,Mark and Lindsay,5,Great imaginative kids programming. It helps bring my kids down if they are too hyper before bed. They know it's time to calm down and let their imaginations take over when this show comes on.
B003EY62H4,patriciavonhartmann,5,Little Bear is very entertaining for young children. Good story lines with no violence. We enjoy watching as a family with the grandkids.
B003EY62H4,Susan D'Alessandro,5,It was delightful!  Held my 3 and 4 year olds attention and they wanted more.  So nicely done too. Highly recommend
B003EY62H4,Ty's Tiny Tip,5,My daughter is 2 and she loves Little Bear. As a parent I like it because the storylines are always easy for her to follow and understand. I also like that the music/soundtrack to the shows are mellow enough that I can play them for her just before nap time and it doesnt get her wound-up like most other shows do.
B003F46RRS,Richard Schaefer,2,This movie didn't strike a nerve with me. It seemed to drag. Others may enjoy it tremendously. Suggest you go ahead and watch at least part and make up your own mind.
B003FGKBSC,Big A "Wesley",5,Daria was one of the most witty and intelligent shows on the air back in the late 90s. I'd recommend this to anyone that grew up with a bit of an sideways look at high school.
B003FGKBSC,Dan Hangen,4,Remember this from years ago and it is still funny plus I missed some episodes so I am glad that it is freeeeeeee.
B003FGKBSC,Kim,4,I find the show funny and in some cases so true to life.  Its nice to watch something thats not a reality show.  Daria shows its not bad to be yourself whoever or whatever you want to be.
B003FGNS9Q,Amy M. Peterson,5,My two year old loves gabba and we watch an episode every day. I like the guest stars and the musical guests and I like that the show tries to teach proper social behavior.
B003FGNS9Q,HannahLynn,5,can't say enough about this show- it's really good and cute. love all the characters. my daughter sings and does all the dancey dances. great show! put all on prime!
B003FGNS9Q,John Johnson,5,I love this series and so do my kids. It keeps them glued to their seat for hours on end.
B003HIC3ZW,My Pen Name,5,Thanks to the guys from MST3K!!!  When will be able to watch RIFF TRAX versions of movies on Amazon?  I might actually pay to watch a Michael Bay movie if we get RIFF TRAX audio with it.
B003HIC4H4,C. G. Porcaro "drivec",5,This episode will have you laughing throughout. The MST3K crew does a great job at riffing this 80s B-movie. This is a great place to start if you want to get into MST3K.
B003HIC4H4,Jennifer D. Williams,5,I really laughed out of the chair watching this show.  I remember it from when I was a little girl.  The movie themselves are so cheesy but it's the commentary that will have you crying.  I love it!!
B003IB91QW,Brenda D. Nelson,3,Not bad.  Would enjoy more information regarding the lives of the people whose lives make up the story.  I like to see more of the courtroom presentations of the forensic evidence.
B003IB91QW,Diana Strole,5,I love these episodes!  True crime stories are so interesting and I love being able to watch them on my Kindle while my husband watches other things.
B003IB91QW,Esther Melchor "Cat Lady",5,This is a really good show.  I love all these true crime documentaries and in this one they use forensic methods that regular people never hear about.  Sometimes it takes years or decades but justice is always served.
B003IB91QW,Jacob Crampton,2,I usually love these type of shows but this one is kinda of boring but it is good if you have nothing else to watch.
B003IB91QW,Janet Lynn,4,It is great how they explain the science behind the crime and the conclusions. It is interesting and a sense of justice to see how it was solved!
B003IB91QW,whatnot,5,Get more season's! The ID channel is great in providing true crime. These channels are why I changed toAmazon Prime.
B003IHN8UG,Larry Parker,4,Unique form of animation combined with a totalitarian state. A very Dark and brooding tale of total mind controll. This is not Orwell's world but the concept is close.
B003IHWLO0,D,5,I love a good documentary and this sure is one.  Great subject!  Well-done! I love hillbillies and stuff about hillbillies! This has inspired me to go on a hillbilly documentary buying spree.  Any suggestions? Please share! I love that the Whites are real and don't apologize! I just love this unusual and well-done subject matter.  The Whites are truly American rebels and Johnny Knoxville did a great job capturing it.
B003IHWLO0,gator,3,Kind of an interesting documentary. It took me a while to believe that it's a true story. It's hard to believe that any family like the Whites would allow themselves to be filmed. But maybe it's more like reality TV.
B003IHWLO0,gpstogo "Lee",1,Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.
B003KYZI5U,Fast Freddy "Fred",5,These episodes are some of the best of the David Tennant Doctor Who series.  I love all the cheeky humor.
B003KYZI5U,Fillionista,5,The David Tennant specials are a loving celebration and a heartfelt farewell salute to the most endearing Doctor EVER.Must see. Must love.  Must own!
B003KYZI5U,I Teach Typing,5,This andDreamlandfit between what Amazon calls seasons 4 and 5.These are absolutely beautiful to watch (in HD) and David Tennant is wonderful in all these episodes.  Planet of the Dead is a great stand alone story.  Even though the final episode feels a bit forced (as they try to cram as many guest appearances as possible...) the overall story resolution is pretty amazing.  So while this was a very short season it is totally enjoyable.
B003KYZI5U,Julie Howard,5,excellent shows - love how the specials add to the story lines. Tennant is of course fabulous. also like they they are all christmas related.
B003KYZI5U,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",5,These specials are fun and a great filler that helps answer a few of the questions about gaps in the regular series. Love the Dr.
B003KYZI5U,lenmaster93,4,The only reason that I'm not giving this five stars is because I only purchased one episode because I had already seen all the other episodes.
B003KYZI5U,notwing,5,excellent excellant.  david did a marvalous job. of carrying his part.  billie was a smart move.  i hope she included in futuresegments.  i will be viewing all segments a i finish one and go tothe next one.
B003KYZI5U,Ryan Pritchard "thor_oakenfelder",5,I think that the 2 part End of Time specials are some of the best episodes written by Russel T Davies. I loved the Master and was happy to see him back and crazier than ever.
B003KYZI5U,Sandy B,5,David Tennant is my favorite Doctor!  Plus the shows in the special are all leading up to the end of Doctor #10.  An awesome set in the series.
B003KYZI5U,splash "splashjam",5,Ever since I was young I have enjoyed watching Dr Who and now my son and I watch it together.
B003KYZI5U,Valerie "exprincess",5,David Tennant is my favorite all time Doctor! I absolutely enjoyed each minute of  these episodes. I'll be very happy to see him return in the 50th anniversary special!
B003KYZI5U,Who Am I? "Me!",3,If I rated each episode individually it would be:Waters of mars - 5 stars  By far the best writing of all the episodes in the specials.Planet of the dead- 2 stars (although I will say that the black actor who plays the female general is absolutely superb in her performance.  Anyone know her name?)The end of time (both parts as one episode)- 3 stars.  This isn't as straight forward to rate because it has some parts that are great but for a large part they really weren't written that well.  The guy playing Donna's dad did wonderfully in his performance as always. I really love the master as a character for various reasons- just like the doctor he carries in him much pain and much joy as well (even though that joy is often from inflicting pain on others).  The defeat of the master in a previous episode was much more heartbreaking and dramatic as we saw The doctor suffer right in front of us when he once again became the last time lord.  This time it wasn't nearly as heart wrenching.  Also the saying goodbye of our beloved time lord was so drawn out (it basically started at Planet of the dead and in this episode he reminds us of the premonition every 10 minutes) that it became melodramatic.  Although the last words "I don't want to go." were beautiful and very realistic. All in all I found it dissapointing for a finale.
B003L4Q0UQ,B. Ying,2,Neil Jordan's Ondine starring the always dependable Colin Farrell and the enchanting Polish actress.The 1st 3 quarter of the film was captivating with the suitable Irish background and mystery.It fell apart at the final quarter.  It became nothing but a routine eastern mafia smuggling alien to a foreigncountry plot which destroyed all the foregoing mystery and enchantment.A very disappointing recent effort from Neil Jordan.
B003L4Q0UQ,Donna L. Sako,5,I enjoyed the acting and the story. A fairy tale mixed with mystery. It takes  on  an old fairy tale and updates it.
B003L4Q0UQ,G. Teslovich,1,Background: A Selkie is a mythological sea creature that can become human.This movie consisted of the following stereotypic formula pieces tossed together to form the script such as: single divorced alcoholic fisherman; disabled daughter; dysfunctional mom and step father; suspicious town folk; homespun priest; Selkie brings good luck to the fisherman and daughter; criminal element added as a threat to the Selkie.Overall this Selkie interpretation seemed disjointed and shallow; lacking emotional depth and mystery. Not as good as "The Seventh Stream".
B003L4Q0UQ,K. Thomas,5,Colin Farrell was incredible. I love this film. It was a great whimsical film. Kept you engaged. Would recommend to a friend.
B003L4Q0UQ,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,I SO LOVE THIS MOVIE! THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINION BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND THINK IT'S AWESOME!
B003L4Q0UQ,Terry D. Sparks,4,Surprise ending...good acting; child actor is precious. Learned a lot about Ireland. It is well worth watching if you like mysterious and legend type movies.
B003L4S0VI,Amazon Customer "Grumpy",5,My Granddaughter cannot get enough of these guys. It keeps her entertained and she gets the idea about playing with others.
B003L4S0VI,Amazon Customer,4,My daughter is almost 2 years old and she really enjoys watching this and so do my boys 4.5 yrs and 6.5 years
B003L4S0VI,bek,5,We have watched Yo Gabba Gabba in our home for several years & all 3 of my children love the show. I like it because they learn as they watch. It might come across as corny to us adults but the kids love it & that's what matters.
B003L4S0VI,beth and chris,4,my oldest (5) will still watch this with her brother (2/12) and i'm totally into it. the songs are great and the messages are clear and simple.
B003L4S0VI,B. J. Mitchell,5,Strictly for my grand kids.  It gets their attention every time..  They are 3 and 1 year old and  they dance along with the music.
B003L4S0VI,CrimsonKannon,4,I like the show...my kids enjoy it. I'd have a higher review if the other seasons were on Prime as well. The kids are outgrowing the show as is Nickelodeon.
B003L4S0VI,DDeyton,3,Good clean entertainment but a little on the weird side sometimes. But our kids seem to like it so it stays!
B003L4S0VI,flygirltaylor,5,I downloaded these videos for my two year old grandson who was in the hospital for a few days.  I allowed him to watch them on my kindle while I worked on my laptop.  Watching these took his mind off of being sick and made our stay much more tolerable.
B003L4S0VI,HannahLynn,5,make these prime? PLEASE! these are the best shows. they are crazy and trippy but they send a wonderful message to kids!
B003L4S0VI,hidden,5,The children love the show.  They get bright-eyed when they hear the music start up.  It's a great show for the young ones.
B003L4S0VI,Jane,5,My toddler granddaughter loves this show!  Luckily there are enough episodes in a single season to rotate through without repeating too often.
B003L4S0VI,JC,5,It is like a variety show for kids that allows them to learn about all kinds of music and diversity.
B003L4S0VI,Jeffrey A. Hensley "Hensley's Bluegrass Music",5,This is a great show for young children.  It teaches some really simple lessons without any undesirable agendas attached.  It has quickly grown into a &#34;classic&#34;.
B003L4S0VI,Kerry,5,I'm a nanny an the 7 month old I watch loves this show. Every time it starts he gets so happy an jumps in his jumparoo. They took it off prime and that was a mess of a couple weeks please don't take it off again.
B003L4S0VI,M0ng0l13,5,The show is fantastic! All of our kids love watching it over and over. There is almost nothing that can get our two year old to sit still and be completely attentive like Yo Gaba Gaba.
B003L4S0VI,Michael Hayes,5,My kids love the show and want to watch it all the time. My sons favorite and he has the stuffed animals.
B003L4S0VI,moptop64,5,I wish they would get more seasons up of Yo Gabba Gabba. The kids love it! Netflix used to have 2 seasons
B003L4S0VI,Rosie Palms,5,When I came home from work and saw this show on my TV I nearly fell out.  I mean what the heck was that big red marital aid doing on the TV singing and dancing.  Then I realized it wa a kid's show.  My bad. DJ Lance Rock is a bit to take as well but once you settle in the show is actually pretty good.  You just have to go with it.
B003L4S0VI,Scott T. Hall "AMG Metal",5,YGG is the best. Both of my grandkids love it. We have all of the stuffed characters too. Destined to be a childrens classic.
B003L4S0VI,walrus,5,My toddler luvs to dance and sing along with the yo gabba gabba gang. Cool tricks! Cool tricks! Go crazy!
B003LND0BE,ilikebooks,5,I love this show!  It's intelligent and funny.  Daria's character is so sarcastic and pessimistic but at the same time she does struggle with doing the right thing.  For a cartoon character she seems remarkably human.
B003LND0BE,Karen,5,Daria rocks. This season is no different. i really enjoyed wathcing this series again as an adult. I definitely ddnt get the sarcasm & humor that was going on wen i first watched it as a kid! Don't forget the movie at the end!
B003MAA5J6,John C. bossolt,5,...but it's worth it.  What a hilarious crew of characters!  I really love this show.  And there's the benefit of learning so much  British slang.  The episodes are &#34;crackin'&#34; and &#34;tidy&#34; and &#34;brilliant.&#34;
B003MAA5J6,L J Johnston,5,One of the funniest series ever...don't miss it! I keep coming back to it so I can enjoy the great one-liners & Welsh expressions.
B003MAA5J6,MargyL "MargyL",4,The creators of Gavin and Stacey (Ruth Jones and James Corden) are the &#34;best friends&#34; in this series and they are hysterical.  The writing is great and the characters are all memorable (especially Uncle Bryn - Rob Brydon).  I was really sorry to see this show end and happy to find web rumors of a possible movie.  I would love more of this group of people and the wicked humor you have to love...
B003MCOTT6,Chrystal,5,My 4 year old loves this show. It is very creative and keeps his attention. The five friends use their imagination as they play in their backyards.
B003MCOTT6,crystal beckner,5,Ever since my son was a baby he's loved this show.
B003MCOTT6,eric matheny,5,Fun filled energetic characters that really keep my children's attention . The problem solving and musical soundtracks keep them entertained
B003MCOTT6,E. Yeager,3,This is a wonderful babysitting tool as all of the dream children up to age 12 will sit and watch this without squirming around and &#34;picking on&#34; each other.
B003MCOTT6,kitk85816,5,My granddaughter loves this show. This is her bedtime routined story for us to share each night. Very nice stories that teach and imagination is used in a good way.
B003MCOTT6,Manismi,5,both my sons loved it. Very good story lines with music and fun stuff appropriate for the kids. I wish they had more than 4 seasons.
B003MCOTT6,M. Skiles "r_vin",5,Our son LOVES this show.  The songs are catchy and the stories are amusing and fun!  Definitely recommend for children.
B003MCOTT6,murthom1,5,Singing our way through play! We enjoy Backyardigans for its creativity through make believe and song. A wonderful show for kids!
B003MCOTT6,Nukumach,4,I haven't personally seen it. My daughter watches it. I hear the songs on it though and like it. My daughter doesn't watch something again if she doesn't like it. However I've seen her watch this over and over again.
B003MCOTT6,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,My grandson always request this show and we used to watch it on Netflix.  I had on my queue but they have taken it off streaming.  I decided to search Amazon Prime and found it.  The picture is clear and the sound quality great.  We all enjoy this show.
B003MCOTT6,Paula S. Smith "ChefPaula1965",5,One of our three year old 's favorite shows. We enjoy every episode over and over. Great happy campers are we
B003MCOTT6,Rosanne Dutzer,5,My grandson loves the Backyardigans.  He sings the songs and dances around while watching.  I enjoy watching the episodes with him as they are very entertaining.
B003MCOTT6,Tabitha,2,not a fan. daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about
B003MCOTT6,Timothy J Kilkka,1,The content was more adult oriented and way over my kid's head.  WHy would they market this towards small kids?
B003MCOTT6,Wayne E. Delong,5,These characters imagine they are somewhere or doing something then they break into some great song. When my children were three to five they watched this show to many times to count. They have moved on now but I think that is because they have watched it so many times. This is a good show with good themes for children.
B003N1DFUU,beth and chris,5,this is so much fun and i love it. the kids seem to like it too. we should have started watching this sooner.
B003N1DFUU,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",5,This teaches nice social behavior as well as the goodness in helping others. &#34;this is seweious&#34; is my sons favorite line.
B003N1DFUU,Debra Kittrell,5,Even 'I' like it!  Great for 18-36 month olds.
B003N1DFUU,Gigi123,5,I was first introduced to this tv show by my nieces when they were young and 3 years later I have my own son who watches this show.  He loves it.  The songs are cute and catchy and the episodes are not long either.Teaches the skills of working as a team and helping one another....highly recommend.
B003N1DFUU,michaelmap,5,My two year old really loves this show.  Even my seven year old likes to watch them.  It teaches team work.
B003N1DFUU,patriciavonhartmann,5,This series works well in holding the attention of toddlers and preschoolers. I like it simply because it doesn't display violence and is very age appropriate.
B003N1DFUU,Rosanne Dutzer,5,My grandson love the Wonder Pets and I just love listening to him sing with the episodes!  I definitely recommend for toddlers.
B003N1DFUU,vickie,5,The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed
B003N1KND2,Amazon Customer,3,This show is entertaining but isn't the most educational. The shows can be used as a forerunner to a game of make believe. For example watch the show about space then put on card broad helmets and jump in your refrigerator box space ship...
B003N1KND2,bek,5,My kids love the backyardigans and have watched them for years. I think it's a good show teaching kids how to use their imagination. We can go anywhere we dream of going!
B003N1KND2,Chalupa,5,The Backyardagain's catchy tunes and fun adventures definitely entertain my 3 year old and my 16 month old dances to the music.
B003N1KND2,Howard Roberson,5,Grandkids love it.
B003N1KND2,Janet L. Jackson "California Girl",5,This is my 6 year olds absolute favorite and I can't argue. Their theme of &#34;we have the whole wide world&#34; is a testament to the wonderment of stretching a child's imagination. In every episode they step into their backyard and let their minds go. There is always something to learn.  There is also infectious music (my favorite is the space song by Alicia Keyes) and these Backyardigans have got to be the best dancing cartoons characters ever.
B003N1KND2,Jill Lenden,5,Backyardigans are all great. I have my favorites and my kids do as well. Not too bad on multiple viewings either.
B003N1KND2,Kathy,5,My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.
B003N1KND2,Kindle MomLKS,5,Both my 4 and 3 year olds love being able to watch these episodes anytime. Even though they have watched them a thousand times. Recommend to parents of small children.
B003N1KND2,kitk85816,4,This show is a keeper. It has imagination productivity developement encouraged in each show. And is friendly to older viewers.I usually rate 5 stars _ but i personally do not like witchcraft of any type being introduced into a childs mind at any age. My granddaughter was not allowed to watch that episode
B003N1KND2,Manismi,5,both my sons love it. They are age appropriate with good music and story-line. The characters are funny and lovely.
B003N1KND2,Nukumach,5,I don't watch it personally but I hear the theme song every time my daughter has the kindle. That means a lot because she's very picky on her shows. I Love the songs. Once in a while I would glance in it and see cute characters. Its good for little kids. Cleaner than sponge Bob. I would totally recommend it to those that have little ones.
B003N1KND2,Prentice House "LEE",5,My three year old and fourteen month old can't get enough.  Very colorful and well done for the youngster.  Highly recommended!
B003N1KND2,Rosanne Dutzer,5,My grandson loves The Backyardigans so much that I have purchased several of their CDs.  The singing and dancing is wonderful and so entertaining for the toddlers as well as us adults!
B003N1KND2,Stephanie J. Trillo,5,We sing many of the songs we've learned from here throughout the day. My son loves to see what adventure they will go on enxt.
B003NJJ3PS,Howard Roberson,5,This is a great positive kids show with good educational episodes. Amazons scheduling of this show is one of the reasons I signed up for Prime.
B003NJJ3PS,Kathy,5,My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.  Robot Rampage is their favorite.
B003NJJ3PS,Manismi,5,It is an amazing series of small episodes. Both my kids love watching it. Hope to see few more seasons.
B003NJJ3PS,moptop64,5,My son loves all the episodes in this season. It's the best one! I just wish amazon would make all of them available.
B003NJJ3PS,surgidude,5,my great grandson loves these guys.  the episodes are well done with exceptional music.i recommend this video to any parent or grandparent.
B003NJJ3PS,susan,4,i havent watched this one but it looks cute and i m sure it keeps her coming back for more
B003NQ1T58,Amazon Customer,4,They did a fairly good job with the David Tenet transition but I did prefer his Season One predecessor. The second season lacks some of the overriding cohesion of Season One but is still a great Season of Doctor Who nonetheless. There are some rather boring storylines but most are quite novel and the introduction of Capatain Jack makes the season a must for any Torchwood fans out there. (Another show that should still be on the air)
B003NQ1T58,bruce,3,Mildly entertaining at best. It has its moments and makes you think about time travel and the problems it brings.
B003NQ1T58,Eric Schneider,4,The new Dr. is cool.  The depth of character development continues.  I am still addicted.  The ability to get in and out of trouble and needing each other makes this a good series.
B003NQ1T58,Freda "student artist",4,My grandchildren kept telling me about the Doctor Who and I decided to see what all the hub bub was about.  Have found that I enjoy the adventures of the Doctor and Rose.
B003NQ1T58,HeMeGrrrr,4,The new doctor had a jarring effect on me. Very strong episodes- excellent storylines. But this doc is more emotionally charged. Fringed on soap opera. Love Billy Piper as Rose- she keep me involved & willing to continue the ride.
B003NQ1T58,Inga Wuerges "FlyGirl",5,Packed with action adventure through time and space Dr Who rocks and will not be dissapointing through all seasons.  I'm hooked for life!!!
B003NQ1T58,John Johnson,5,We have gotten hooked on Who and season two is a big one with the love interest of Rose Tyler at play. We highly recommend it!
B003NQ1T58,Kay Beth Stavley,5,Love this series.  Takes me away from any mundane work!
B003NQ1T58,Lolo,4,fun entertaining show. great show to pass the time if you are bored and have time to kill. so enjoy
B003NQ1T58,Lori "lolepere",5,Didn't think I was going to like the &#34;new&#34; doctor...BUT I DO.  I think its great that the writers are developing the characters
B003NQ1T58,Maestro,5,I love the way the English focus more on personality and less on physical perfection. It allows my whole family to enjoy this timeless classic and are fans for life.
B003NQ1T58,Mary M Riley,5,It was my first introduction to Dr Who and it opens the door for many more. It was a good episode.
B003NQ1T58,Richard Schaefer,4,Long live the Doctor. This series never has a low although the highs may very in height. A bright spot in TV that has become overly derivative and full of non-real reality shows for the mindless.
B003NQ1T58,Rosa A. Fernandez,5,These two make a great combo!! I love David Tennent as the tenth doctor and i love the chemistry between him and rose aka Billie piper
B003NQ1T58,Stephanie Lynn Moore,5,The perfect part for the perfect actor.  David Tennant pulls you in to the plot with believable realistic talent that comes natural to him even when a facial expression is all that is needed.
B003NQ1T58,tigerfire2002,5,Of course everytime there is a new Doctor it's worrisome but not with David. Him and Billie have an amazing chemistry together. And the storylines are even better.This season had me laughing and crying on several occasions. And the finale...wow!
B003NQ1T58,Virgil F. Keller,4,The series provides the sci-fi ones expects of Dr. Who.  It is somewhat repetitive and I can only take a few doses at a time.
B003NQ1T58,WednesdaySundae,5,Love Season 2 even more than Season 1 of Dr Who. Builds on the emotion right up to the end! :) :) :) Totally worth watching again and again! One of my favorite seasons out of all of the new series (having watched up to series seven so far).
B003NRVE6Q,Angie,5,Very informative and interesting characters. It teaches a history lesson of early medicine with medical innovations and life before vaccines. Enjoyed it very much.
B003NRVE6Q,Bekka "Bekka",5,Great show!  Well researched and presented!  Actual records used for story!  Shows how brutal the conditions were for the poor.
B003NRVE6Q,Daniel Cooper "dancoopermedia",5,Watching this is like watching ER set in London in 1906. The production values are fabulous and the performances as you would expect -- great. Don't miss it.
B003NRVE6Q,Darlene,4,Interesting history of early medicine.  Kind of sad and hopeless back then.
B003NRVE6Q,DebbieT,5,I really loved watching this series and the reality of how life was in London so many years ago. The situations are heart breaking but things that actually do occurr in life. Amazing cast!!!
B003NRVE6Q,Denise Brown "Have a blessed day!",5,this is a excellent show! I am enjoying learning about how medicine was practiced in the early 1900s. I love the fact that the stories are based on actual history and not made up. We need more show like this on tv...
B003NRVE6Q,Foster,4,This might have been just another period piece like Bramwell or Ripper Street all of which are fine representations of late 1800's early 1900's London East End. Full of gritty realism and we'll acted it avoids soap opera forms. Not for the weak of stomach.What makes this special is that the unique elements animating the scripts are drawn from diaries of hospital workers of that period and there are historical footnotes supplied at the end of each segment to verify or resolve some of the events shown.  It's Reality TV that is much closer to reality than the staged Reality TV we are normally fed.
B003NRVE6Q,GrammeK,5,I just love this series! I wish there were more than 2 seasons. I like the characters & the historical story line. It makes one realize how far medicine has come.
B003NRVE6Q,grand,4,Medical care has advanced greatly. It is worrisome now that politicians have made a power grab to interfere with our health.
B003NRVE6Q,Jacqui Hawkins,5,As a fan of General Hospital - I thought this show would be a London version...not so. Its incredibly graphic but also based on true stories found in records and notes from the hospital's history. The dedication of these nurses is far surpassing of even nurses today...and I count several nurses as friends.
B003NRVE6Q,Joan,5,London Hospital Season 1 could be called a Grey's Anatomy for the previous centuries.  I have only watched episode 1 but will watch more
B003NRVE6Q,Joan M. Poole,4,A little bit gory as to how medicine was practiced over 100 years ago but truly interesting as to how far we have come in the medical field.
B003NRVE6Q,Jo Ann Massaro,5,I was looking for a good series to watch and found this by accident. It is factually and brutally honest. The acting to superb.
B003NRVE6Q,John,5,This is what television is all about!  Hope there is more to come.  It gives you a real appreciation for what these women endured during those rugged times.
B003NRVE6Q,Laura Lezlie Rice,4,Imagine having ER or Chicago Hope take place in the 1800's. That is what this show is like. I think it is great to think how far we have come when you can see what they had to deal with back then. For instance X-ray was just evolving and the X-ray tech dies of radiation poisoning. I can't wait to see where the show will lead to next. This is also a great period drama if you are into that sort of thing.
B003NRVE6Q,LaurenG,5,I love London Hospital there is never a dull movement. The actors are all wonderful! I would love to see more episodes.
B003NRVE6Q,Nikiwiki,4,I just rated  Season 2 as Excellent.  This is a well-told story documenting the living conditions in London during the 1700's and very well told.  I definitely enjoyed its authenticity.
B003NRVE6Q,Peggy H. Rose,1,We found it difficult to get into - didn't seem to be building the characters in an easy way.  Also some of the accents were hard to decipher.  Probably just not our cup of tea.
B003NRVE6Q,Terri,5,This series was so well done!  I wish there would have been more than two seasons of it.  Highly recommend!
B003NRVE6Q,William Clem,1,I'm sorry but I couldn't get through the first episode. I was just too morose. The character development was hideous.
B003NRWVMC,Alex Colby,5,Season two follows with the same excellent cast and true stories of the London hospital and the advancement of medicine as well as the personal lives of the staff.
B003NRWVMC,Amazon Customer,5,Reminds me of how fortunate we are to have the advancement in the medical practices.  Very humbling that so many died and through their deaths our healthcare is so improved.Acting is superb.
B003NRWVMC,anniemary,4,Wonderful period piece about London and the medical care available at the turn of the century.  Particularly interesting to those who can compare past and present medical training
B003NRWVMC,babsd,5,I was so disappointed that it came to an  end. I had invested time and interest in these characters and wanted to see more. I enjoyed watching the progeression of medicine in London during this period and comparing it to today's doctors and nurses.Would like more series in this vein.
B003NRWVMC,Boggart,5,Too bad this series never went beyond season two. It has everything a good series should have. The characters are human rather than unrealistic and the viewer can relate to their situations. You found yourself drawn into the plot. That each episode largely stood alone didn't matter. You wanted to know what happened in the next episode because there was just enough plot carry over to keep you hooked. The series provided medical and social history in context and in a way that was simply fascinating. I learned things about the history of medicine that totally surprised me. This is a little like what happened to the series Firefly. Somewhere a group of executives are kicking themselves for cutting short a real money maker.
B003NRWVMC,B's Mom,5,I love period shows especially dramatizations of real life events and this show was definitely one of the  great ones.  The suffering of the very poor and the politics involved in relation to running a hospital made the show interesting.
B003NRWVMC,Christine Poortenga,5,I could watch a whole lot more of this series.  The character development is very interesting and easy to follow
B003NRWVMC,Coco,5,I enjoyed every minute of Season one and two.  I was very sorry there was not more.  Excellent acting.  Very realistic. I enjoy the historical aspect of the show as well as the drama that was weaved in to make it very interesting.  I would definitely recommend.  A little graffic but so were the times in medicine.  Knowledge we limited and they did the best they could.
B003NRWVMC,Daniel Cooper "dancoopermedia",5,Watching this is like watching ER set in London in 1906-09. The production values are fabulous and the performances as you would expect -- great. Don't miss it.
B003NRWVMC,Darlene,4,Very interesting but sometimes too gruesome and sad.
B003NRWVMC,Denise Brown "Have a blessed day!",5,Another excellent episode although it almost got knocked back to 4 stars . the reason is i didnt really see the reason for trying to jam a love story in a hour episode. but the ending restored it back to a 5 star review. i love this show but the writers are sometimes trying to jam to many stories in 1 episode..
B003NRWVMC,Edward M. Abney,5,The cast in London Hospital is first rate.  The realistic presentation of how miserable life was for the poor and how injuries and disease were treated in the 19th century makes one appreciate the advances in medicine that are available today.
B003NRWVMC,Elizabeth D. Janz,5,This is a wonderful period series based on true stories.  The cast is wonderful.  The writing is A1 and I would recommend to anyone who loves period pieces.
B003NRWVMC,Ellyn M. Renken,5,Great acting and great history!  Now I'm looking for season 1.  How far the medical industry has come in 100 years!
B003NRWVMC,ezrismommi,5,This is by far one of the best written and most historically acurate shows I have seen in a long time. Stumbled across the first series a week ago and have spent every evening since watching it. It is interesting and pulls you in. Would recommend to anyone!
B003NRWVMC,Fly4u,5,I wish there were more seasons! :-(  I watched the two seasons in a sort or marathon and wanted more at the end.
B003NRWVMC,Gizmo "ctwin60",5,This was a great series with good acting and true to the time period. London Hospital was ahead of it's time as far as treating the sick and injured. It was fascinating to see how people were treated and that the hospital opened at 8am with patients lined up at the gate. London Hospital pioneered new treatments and procedures while treating the poor. I loved that they smoked in the operating rooms while working on patients as the patients drank a cup of tea!  If you like history and medicine you should watch this series.
B003NRWVMC,Joan,5,This season is even better than season one.  It continues to provide excellent interesting stories.  Wish it had more seasons to watch.
B003NRWVMC,John,5,This is what television is all about!  Hope there is more to come.  There should be a real appreciation for what these women endured during those rugged times.
B003NRWVMC,Kindle Customer,5,I loved this show!  I wish there were about 5 more seasons...  I'm still thinking about it and I watched the last episode over a week ago!
B003NRWVMC,LadyM,5,Love the history of the way things used to be.  Acting is terrific.  Characters are brought to life through history. Can't wait for series 3
B003NRWVMC,Lisa "boston's biggest baked bean",5,The storyline is more entertaining than season 1. Still lacking in character development but the clinical side makes up for it. Wish it had another season.
B003NRWVMC,Marie "Marie",5,found it to be very interesting and knowledgeable for the time era.  wished there were more seasons.  would watch them all.
B003NRWVMC,Nika "LovesDharma",5,This show is simply addictive. I would love to see more seasons. I recommend that you give it a try.
B003NRWVMC,opirty "opirty",3,Makes you glad that you were not a patient!!!Otherwise probably true to the period ! Watch if you like the period
B003NRWVMC,Sadcelticlady,5,You do not want to miss this series it is awesome ! Great storyline ! True to timeline ! Accurate history . The acting is amazing ! Price to die for ! A must see !
B003NRWVMC,Viv,5,I congratulate the actors for excellent portrayals of nurses and injured people who lived in the early years of the London Hospital. I can't wait until the next seasons are ready for viewing.
B003NRYJDQ,beth holman,5,A series about health group lets flu epedmic out and everyones dies except for ages..  I recommend it for ages 18 and up.
B003NRYJDQ,Lauren,5,This is actually a very good drama set against an end of the world type situation.  If you like Walking Dead and Revolution you will like Survivor.
B003NS0O70,Cynthia M. Ferguson,5,I enjoyed the entire series; although I would have liked another season to find out what happened at the end.
B003NS0O70,Kelly Carlton,3,need better stories; seems like the same old thing just with a different &#34;monster&#34;.  I wish they hadn't killed off Cutter.
B003NS0O70,Nancy Mayton,5,this show keeps you on your toe's from start to finish. I can't wait to see the next season.  woooohoooo
B003NS0O70,Paul M. Frasca "PMF",5,Hoping to finish it up before it expires on amazon.  It is very entertaining with the different types of anomalies and dinosaurs that come out.
B003OURWUO,An Open Book "MacDhomnhul",5,I've watched all of the Foyle series and have become a true fan of all the characters. The timeframe of WW II and the civil problems faced by the English are very interesting.
B003OURWUO,Beth E. Leeseman,4,This has been such an enjoyable series for me.  Having always been interested in this time period of history in England I started to watch.  The characters are well acted and personable.  They have been through lots of trials and yet there is still humor and humanity.
B003OURWUO,Carol B. Anderson,5,I was anxious to view this series because I wanted to see what happened to the American he promised to hunt down.  This series begins with his return to England.  Is there a series about his American venture?
B003OURWUO,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,4,I enjoy experiencing fictional life with a hero who abides by his personal and professional compass and does what is right and is confident that doing right is the only way.
B003OURWUO,C. Perez "c. perez",5,I've watched all the seasons and wish there were more. I like Foyles style of detective work and  plots which can be several intertwined in an episode.
B003OURWUO,Faith Gaskin,5,I understand that it is going into production again and I'm looking forward to seeing the new programs. Very enjoyable program.
B003OURWUO,John,5,I really enjoy this series of Foyle's War.  I watched all that they ran on PBS TV channel.  Good shows to try to figure out who done it.  Hope all that views this series will enjoy it as I did.
B003OURWUO,kathleen capela,5,World war 2 is one of my favorite time periods and this takes place in England during the war. I wish there were more seasons to watch unfortunately this was the last season only bad thing about British TV the series end
B003OURWUO,KTL,5,This show is very entertaining and full of history. The mystery is full of twists and turns and are difficult to solve like many programs that are easy to predict.
B003OURWUO,michael kallal,5,I love all the Foyle/s War programs.  Michael Kitchen is the best.  I was disappointed that season 7 only had 3 episodes as does season 8.  Tell them not to rest so much and get back to work giving us a full season of episodes.
B003OURWUO,Rebecca Lee,5,My husband and I love Foyle's War.  The characters are wonderful and the stories are so real and relavant.  We're learning more about the British point of view during WW11.
B003OURWUO,sharon kemm,5,every episode in the series keeps you interested and you want more. by the way- will there be more?? i'd like to see more of foyle's war.
B003OURWUO,Sudsy,5,Television at its best!. Quality show&#8230;actors are top notched and scripts are well written.A very different look  at such a sad time in the history of England. Hope the remaining seasons will be on air soon. Only negative is there are no subtitles.
B003P8ZZVI,Adrianne M. Callahan "3kmom",4,The parents were very crazy. They are like stage moms and the kids are very cocky about themselves but I did enjoy the kids performances and the way they performed.
B003P8ZZVI,Ma'am "Ma'am",4,I enjoy the crazy moms who really aren't aware as to who this child is they are raising. If you like to see bizarreBehavior this is the show for you.
B003P8ZZVI,Mary paushel,5,I love being able to go back and watch my favorite episodes over and over.  The sound and quality is excellent.
B003P8ZZVI,r. laver,5,this show is a good show and i love it so much i this it a funny to watch this kids on this show.thank you
B003PDL346,Chris's Review,5,I just love leverage.  it's one of my favorite shows. each season was better than the next season. to bad it was cancelled after just five seasons.
B003PDL346,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,As the cast gets more and more into character the quirks each character has really add to the story.  I think the funniest piece to date is when a couple of inept bad guys spill Eliot's coffee.As usual picture and sound on the disks is perfect.
B003PDL346,L,4,This season caused me to start watching Leverage - now I am hooked.  This season had some good episodes but Season 4 had great episodes and Season 1 had some tearjerkers.
B003PDL346,lremick,5,The team is really good at the con to help them get the bad people who are always up to no good.
B003PDL346,Steven T. "Steve",5,I really enjoy this series.  I have purchase all the films.  Great series.  They are a lot of fun. Thumbs up.
B003PDL346,Susan Harris,5,What a great premise righting wrongs done by the rich and powerful.  To bad there is no one around know to do this with our rich and powerful.
B003PDL346,T. Brady "Tom",4,I love watching the 5 seasons of this.  Characters play their roles right to the letter.  There is diversity which makes for quite an entertaining series.
B003PDL346,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",4,Leverage Season 3 is a program that my wife likes. I find the plots a bit far fetched. She rates it as 4 stars.
B003PDL346,wc1001,5,I love this show - period!  Each season they have a new set of unique plots and I really enjoy watching the cons unfold. LOVE  Christian Kane!!!
B003PDL346,W. Simons "Wendi8",5,This show started out two season ago on a high note and never lets you down.  Characters are fascinating yet believable and very human.  The "bad guys" really are the best guys and gals on TV.
B003Q97D48,D. R. Roberts,5,Love these books!I was hooked on them really quick and vey addictive!!I got up early to get the newest release as soon as it come out!!Easy read and four friends characters are intriguing and very sexy.
B003Q97D48,Gabriella W.,3,Coffee!! The characters are either making coffee or drinking coffee...all of the time. If there is such a thing as a Columbian Coffee Bean Grower's Association? I am sure they are behind it. :)
B003QH7E94,Ajith Joseph,5,My 6 and 2 yr old are both equally excited about the adventures and mystery solving abilities of Blue and his friend.
B003QH7E94,Christine Vogelsang,5,Blue's Clues is a great show for kids. It makes them think and covers all educational areas such as math and science. My preschool grandchildren love it!
B003QH7E94,C. McKay "jewelry godess",5,Great show for kids of all ages!  My 7 year old and 4 year old still watch it and really enjoy it!
B003QH7E94,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,My grandson watches Blue's Clues often. I was at the airport watching another toddler watching it. It's warm and gentle yet stretches the thinking.
B003QH7E94,gregory,5,Who doesn't love to watch blues clues.  My kids have yet to see an episode that they didn't like with steve or with joe
B003QH7E94,Jane Zachary,5,my two year old loves the show and is learning lots! i especially enjoy how excited she gets about the clues!
B003QH7E94,Jeffrey A. Hensley "Hensley's Bluegrass Music",5,Blue's Clues is one of our favorites.  It teaches simple lessons that children can usually pick up on pretty easily.  It's also entertaining enough that parents can sit through an episode without feeling tortured!  We are happy that Amazon is streaming this series.
B003QH7E94,moptop64,5,My son Irving loves Blues clues. He talks to Steve and Joe and loves to find clues. Netflix no longer has blues clues. So it's Amazon for us!
B003QH7E94,Sheree "Shar",5,My children enjoyed these video very much.  The videos are very entertaining and educational.  The lenght of the videos is perfect.
B003QMJJCY,Charlotte Puderbaugh,5,This show is very kid friendly. My 4 yr old granddaughter just loves it. I  like that there is no violence and that it teaches life lessons.
B003QMJJCY,Daizy72,5,We limit television viewing in our home. It's important to us that programs the children watch have value beyond entertainment. Blue's Clues certainly fits this criteria! I'm glad to have it available on Amazon Prime.
B003QMJJCY,EBeeH,4,Blue's Clues is a classic Nick Jr. show and my preschool age kiddos love it. The animation is cute and Steve speaks on their level without patronizing (which is important to me).
B003QMJJCY,g.hilary,5,This one seems to be my 4 year old grand-daughters favorite Magenta is a very cute addiction !Thank you so much
B003QMJJCY,gregory,5,Whether it was many years ago or today or yesterday blues clues is a show that's always watched in our house!
B003QMJJCY,HannahLynn,5,Watch this with my daughter all the time. keeps her interested. she calls every dog 'blue'added all the seasons to watchlist!
B003QMJJCY,Kerry,5,What can I say the kids love love love this show. I'm glad it's on prime for them!!!! We watch it all the time.
B003QMJJCY,Kindle Customer,5,When this show was first aired my children love loved it.  I even had to find the &#34;clue&#34; writing book.  Now my youngest grandson at 2 yrs is just as fascinated by the energy and colors that is shown.  He gets just as involved looking for Blue's clues as his mom did.  I would recommend this high energy positive presentation of the joy of learning and solving puzzles.
B003QMJJCY,N. R. "Handy Mandy",5,A wonderfully done cartoon. The imagery and artwork is beautifully done. The pace is exciting without being too overstimulating and frazzling like many of the other kids shows on today. Clues keep the kids guessing and playing the game of catch with nice scenario and allot of excitement for the little ones. Good informative show that will keep the kids happy.
B003QMJJCY,Sheree "Shar",5,My son (who is 3 years old) and daughter (who is 5 years old ) really enjoyed this season of Blue's Clues.
B003QMJJCY,Tabitha,5,Great!! I grew up on blue and now my child can do the same and loves it. Classic. Educational. Good family time
B003R7R1ZK,Annamarie Lubow "Anna",5,I love Betty White in this series and seeing &#34;Daphne&#34; from the old Frasier series as a caustic middle aged woman is a hoot.  Good dialogue and great characters.
B003R7R1ZK,Book worm,4,This is a great new show that is not just like every other sitcom out there.  This was only half a season and I wished it was longer.
B003R7R1ZK,charles ackley,5,Its great watching a show that is funny and clean to watch with whole family and Betty white is funnier than ever
B003R7R1ZK,K'ann Strohl,5,Never watched the show before. Really enjoying the show so far.all 4 women are funny and click. So happy I can watch from the beginning.
B003R7R1ZK,Marilyn M. Green,4,I have missed many episodes of this show when it is on TV so I just open my Kindle and watch at my convenience. The show is a comedy but it does focus on the lives of middle aged woman. It's just fun to see them entertain us.
B003R7R1ZK,mayzey "d.littin",4,I can watch this. I think a sense of humor is the most important thing you can give yourself in life. This is sarcastic - humor the way I like it.
B003R7R1ZK,M. Naidas,5,Great series
B003R7R1ZK,Robert C. Wieland "MUSIC LOVER",3,Not nearly as funny as it could be with the great cast that they have.. A well thought out punch line here and there do not make for a great show. Maybe some new writers might the help the show. And it only got an It's okay because of the actors otherwise it would have been one less star
B003R7R1ZK,S. Guerin,5,Hot in Cleveland is my daily treat of good humor.  The ladies represent the every woman in the most humorous way! Great writing and acting make this a show to share with any adult.  Not for children.
B003R7R1ZK,S. Mansfield,5,It's the characters who make a show enjoyable and these four are wonderful.  The plots are rather mundane at times but the actors make it worthwhile.
B003R7R1ZK,S. Marsh,5,Lots of fun and comedy. The main actresses are people I have either watched growing up or I grew up watching them. The writing and acting are great.
B003R7R1ZK,Sophie,5,Great set of characters.  Never laughed so much!  Would recommend to all women and a few men with a sense of humor.
B003R7R1ZK,Stacie M Guy,5,Decided to watch Season One one night as my husband watched football.  This series is laugh out loud funny.  Enjoyed it immensely.
B003R7R1ZK,The ROK,5,are SO damn funny! And I love Valerie and the English girl...so hot! Well in Cleveland that is! Love the show!
B003RG3ND0,glacierbear,4,one of the more realistic survival shows. From my knowledge of primitive survival These guys are the most realistic. The knowledge that Cody demonstrates and the calmness in which he goes about his day to day survival is amazing.
B003RRW3BC,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,4,Policy makers and politicians versus the real source of power as symbolized by a four leaf clover. Watch the season and come to your own conclusions. The 1% are powerful because...
B003RRW3BC,B's Mom,5,Too bad the show was cancelled.  I really enjoyed watching it.  The character development and the plot twists kept me engaged.  I would love to have seen a second season.
B003RRW3BC,Carole M,5,Riveting. Wish there'd been a second season but glad for the ending. One of the most satisfying single season shows ever.
B003RRW3BC,DD "DD",2,This series just drags and drags____ i lost interest and have not watched the rest of the season. I got about 3/4 of the way through the season waiting for a big moment of some sort to happen. It never happened. I may try to finish watching it
B003RRW3BC,djr311,5,The story line is so intense you can't wait until the next episode.  Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?  You think you have it figured out and then there is a new twist.  It is great mind candy for the mystery/thriller junkie.  I can't believe it was only filmed for one season.  How did we let that happen?  Bring back Rubicon season 2.
B003RRW3BC,Frank,4,It was a pretty good show. If it had gone on longer I would have watched it to the end.
B003RRW3BC,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,The acting and the story line is great!  It keeps you intrigued.  You will enjoy this series which we highly recommend.
B003RRW3BC,Gerold Ransom "G Mon'e",3,I was watching this at work and got a little hooked it is a good season but not a full 5
B003RRW3BC,grand,5,Rubicon is well written and acted. I am sorry there is only one season. Many questions are unanswered and left in limbo.
B003RRW3BC,John Winner "JHW",5,I enjoyed watching this recently for the first time. Important relevance to current situation in both the UK (with all the camera tracking of persons and cars in London) and especially to the US - with all the information about NSA and other government agencies collecting and sharing data on innocent individuals. Dramatic and interesting.
B003RRW3BC,Julia Brown "naples4kids",4,I really enjoyed watching this series.  The acting and writing is great and the story line was interesting and believable. Unfortunately it was not renewed for a second season and the last episode did not tie up the story line.
B003RRW3BC,Kindle Customer,5,This is one of the best of its type.  The plot is very complex and it would be difficult to outguess the writers.  I highly recommend this series.
B003RRW3BC,KOBAM,5,Rubicon is straight out of the conspiracy theories held by those who are our most fearful and perhaps least logical citizens. It makes for sad commentary but also for greatly enjoyable viewing. So suspend disbelief and wade in you will not regret it.  Is there going to be a season two? I hope so.
B003RRW3BC,Leah,4,This was different than an average show. You will probably have a lot of it worked out before the main character because it shows you more. It is still worth watching.
B003RRW3BC,Lee Lyte,2,I like these kinds of programs. This one disappointed.Confusing and slow. No build of like for any characters except Richardson and ..... Why didn't he pick up the CD? I should stop here.
B003RRW3BC,luvsminis "mini horse lover",4,i chose this rating because i enjoyed it. i dont like profanity so like movies without it. i would recommend this series.
B003RRW3BC,Nana C,5,Had to watch the season to figure out what was going on but very intriguing.  It still left unanswered questions though.
B003RRW3BC,New2This,5,I had never heard of this program before but I must say that I enjoyed itimmensely.  This program is very well written and acted.
B003RRW3BC,Nick Kaspar,5,Too bad it didn't get picked up for additional seasons.  &#34;Rubicon&#34; had great potential.  It was like &#34;X-Files&#34; but without the aliens and supernatural. The twists and turns this series takes are just enough to keep you intrigued but not enough to give you whiplash (like &#34;The Following&#34; does).  The entire cast are amazing in their roles.  James Badge Dale carries the show without getting in the way of the other actors' performances.  Dallas Roberts is perfect as the comic relief of the team.  The great Miranda Richardson turns in an excellent performance as the tortured widow trying to figure out why her husband committed suicide.  Even Arliss Howard shows that a gay character can be the moral center of a show whose target audience is straight men.  I enjoyed watching &#34;Rubicon&#34; and recommend this series to anyone.
B003RRW3BC,Phyllis,3,Haven't finished the season yet - it's fun - getting a bit thin - but fun. For some reason it's just not out first choice
B003RRW3BC,P. Tibbs "Pat Tibbs",4,This series is intense and exciting. The acting and writing are very good. I can't understand why it wasn't renewed.
B003RRW3BC,Rburch,5,Best government conspiracy show in a decade. Cannot believe they shut it down after one season . Wish it would continue
B003RRW3BC,Richardao,5,This was started as a very good show. It was on for only one season.It could have been a great show but you decide.
B003RRW3BC,Robert Fischer "Alone At the Alter",3,The plot moves slowly and the characters aren't that compelling. I go back to this series from time to time to &#34;cleanse my palate&#34; so to say.
B003RRW3BC,Scott,5,This is a deep thriller so you'll need patience with the storyline as it eeks out clues bit by bit. To bad AMC didn't think it was worthy of a 2nd season.
B003RRW3BC,Scotty,5,Great show only one season though so don't get excited no ending just leaves you hanging but still worth the watch for us conspiracy nuts :)
B003RRW3BC,S. McDonald,3,I want to give this series 3.75.. I found the series by accident. I'm glad I did. There is intrigue around every corner- it has a Canadian feel to the film quality
B003RRW3BC,southerntothecore "richard",4,The movies and TV shows usually follow the agent in the field as they go about saving the world from doom. This one takes the viewer deep in-house to &#34;fly on the wall&#34; with a team on &#34;intel analysts&#34; that look and act nothing like the James Bond.. BUT... manage to follow the disjointed clues t unravel the a sinister Gordian knot of clues to deal with the bad guys. It kept my interest all the way through..
B003RRW3BC,Steve,5,This is an exceptionally well done program. The actors and plot lines fit together into an intense and absorbing show.
B003RRW3BC,Ted,4,If you like being strung along with multiple mysteries on many episodes this is for you.  I do like the cast and the ability to watch an episode every other day so the story line is fresh in my mind.
B003RRW3BC,Terri,5,Enjoyed the characters immensely; well developed personalities.  The season kept me interested and excited for the next episode. Love it that it is on Prime to watch streaming.
B003RRW3BC,troutpaws "troutpaws",5,Compelling story. Is a bit slow at times but Excellentry writing. Thoughtful acting. You like these people. Another well done series by AMC
B003S7JPSU,Andrew A,5,Great DVD. Contains the latest episodes from the most recent run of Futurama from Comedy Central. The episodes are hilarious and includes bonus content. A true Futurama fan will not be disappointed!
B003T0M4U2,A. Thompson "marie michael gabriel raphael",5,i have continued my anti-aging studies because of Morgan Freeman's insight into the aging process and how soon we are going to lick it for good.  This was the best in the series along with the others which is just as well done and informative as the anti aging segment.
B003T0M4U2,Kat Kay "Kat Kay",5,I'm am really enjoying this program.  There is lots of science and lots of questions about possibilities.  This is a great purchase.
B003T0M4U2,Small Town Blues "jf",5,I have always loved sci-fi stuff but real science intimidated me a LOT. I went back to college in my 40s and found out not only did I like science I was pretty good at it. This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!
B003TJKRXY,Amazon Customer,5,If you value some time for your kids to wind down and they are just not up for a story. Little Bear takes children on an adventure using Little Bear's fun and wholesome imagination.
B003TJKRXY,gregory,1,I REALLY HATE IT BECASUE I DON'T LIKE IT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY AND WE DO NOT LIKE IT THAT WAS OK
B003TJKRXY,Kelley Forrester,5,My kids love this show and I love that it's safe for them to watch. I feel confident that they can watch it and I don't have to worry that they will see something they shouldn't.
B003TJKRXY,L. Wickline,5,Great wee stories and great morals. Highly recommend! My 2 year old and 7 year old and I all agree :)
B003TJKRXY,Mark and Lindsay,5,This imaginative program offers beautiful animation mixed with fun adventures. My kids love anything that involves imagination and there is plenty of it in this program.
B003TJUEOQ,Amazon Customer "Renaissance Man",5,Little Bear is sweet and a great way for kids to wind down.  Good music and imagination.  I would highly recommend.
B003TJUEOQ,Chefgrandma,5,Little Bear is always entertaining and fun! My little ones love every episode and so do I. They even learn some things by watching!
B003TJUEOQ,gregory,1,I don't like it all it was very great that was for adults and was not beautiful and that is not pretty
B003TJUEOQ,Rose ASL,5,Little Bear is such a long-time favorite of mine. They just don't make decent kids' shows any more. I can't wait for the other seasons to go up on Prime.
B003TVS3JC,Mix-in-it,5,One of my favorite shows on SNICK.  Had to re-live the moment.  Oh where oh where did my youth go?  Come back.  JK.
B003TVS3JC,Mpr90,5,My favorite cartoon from when I was a kid! I've been waiting a LONG TIME for these DVD. Thank GOD!! I'm all for Ickis! He's my favorite!!! I'm glad these are back. Check em out! You'll love these little guys!
B003TVS5C2,Judith E. Oakland,2,I loved Kevin Kline in Dave.  It's one of my favorite movies.  I also loved him in the Cole Porter movie.  I writing that to soften my criticism; I feel disloyal when I say he is wasted in this stupid movie.  He is usually wonderful in everything he does.  Just my opinion.
B003TVS5C2,Michael Harbour "mharbour",3,It's all about eccentricity. But eccentricity played mostly for charm and amusement by actors who accomplish this sort of thing well. It's a fun trifle.
B003U6OTK8,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",3,Talk about actors that can do deadpan. I like it but man I don't know if I can watch more than one. On the other hand I want to see what happens next.
B003U6OTK8,Consumer 45,5,It is pure fun. Nonsense at its best. Not in the league of Archer or the Venture Brothers but holds its own against other more animated stuff from the East.Will watch more should Amazon offer it on Prime.
B003U6OTK8,Kenny G,4,This is a unique production and I found very comicly done.  Although there is a lot of cursing and I don't approve it for the very young.  Late teens on who are hooked on HALO and have a vivid imagination will find this production series enjoyable to watch.
B003ULUF9W,juan,5,This is a beautiful video show.  I love nature.  I enjoy watching this series because these landscapes and animal are on the verge of extinction.  This is a good documentary.
B003ULUF9W,Lawrence Rivett Jr. "Elvis Mercury",4,Stunning photography and lots of information on the wildlife and geographic features of South America.  If you love geography and learning about the native animals and plants of South America it is a great watch.
B003UMJTPW,AMason,4,My little ones figured out how to purchase videos and shows on our kindles and this one happened by accident! Fortunately its a good one and they love it.
B003UMJTPW,Cathy,5,My 3 yr old son loves George! AND I do believe he learned a word or concept 1 out of 2 episodes :)
B003UMJTPW,Claudine,5,We love Curious George. He is the cutest little monkey and always fixes his mistakes. All you need is love to make a family. And George proves that.
B003UMJTPW,John Johnson,5,We all watch Curious George in my family. I sometimes find myself watching it even after my kids have left the room...good fun for everyone in the family and you can surprisingly learn from it even at a later age...
B003UMJTPW,Monica,5,Hilarious and fun. Curious George does not disappoint! I thoroughly enjoy watching this with my two year old over and over again.
B003UOHP92,Lyns the cook,5,This show is too good. I can't help but put this one all the time. The set is nice n small in size so it doesn't take a lot of room on the self.
B003UOHP92,Michael Dobey,5,I have yet to see a bad 'futurama' show. Some are great and some are decent. But this show was consistantly great. In fact it won awards. The animation is top notch like usual and the blu ray version tops the dvd by miles. In fact this show is popular enough to release all the seasons on blu ray.
B003UPE4WC,Birder Girl,1,Elijah Wood is repugnant in the sex scenes. He should stick to playing elfs.  The script and plot are boring and badly executed. There are some fine actors stuck in this awful mess. Don't waste your time.
B003UPE4WC,Book Lover,2,Wish I could say the same for the acting. Elijah Wood sounded like he was in a high school production. His lameness colored the entire production.
B003UPE4WC,Donna L. Sako,5,Good acting and interesting story line and plot. Keeps you guessing throughout. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in mysteries.
B003UPE4WC,Evie "book weaver",2,I did not enjoy this movie at all.  It was boring from beginning to end.  Not worth watching.  Pass it up.
B003UPE4WC,gregg dunn,3,All I can remember about this movie is the love scenes. The young lady preparing the spaghetti was so DELICIOUS !!Tobey Maguire is the not very convincing in this role.
B003UPE4WC,jean h.,2,Did not care for the story line.  The series was too far out to be realistic.  Just not my kind of movie.
B003UPE4WC,L. Grueneberg,4,At first I struggled with the story but as it continued my interest improved and I had to watch it to the end.  Give it s try.  The acting was good.
B003UPE4WC,Verna Metzger,5,Kept moving and was a great mystery
B003UU1UTC,Babbs,5,I loved this show and wish it were on a local network.  I loved the action and intrigue..bring on more like this!
B003UU1UTC,David Murphy "Nalvage",5,I find this show uplifting. All the characters are perfect. Hope this show continues on. Of course the main character is great.
B003UU1UTC,EGOlsen,5,I watched this once out of boredom and felt only slightly less bored when I was done. Haven't seen it enough to get a feel for the actors.
B003UU1UTC,E. Lillian Creveling,4,I enjoyed this series.  She is another &#34;wonder woman hero&#34;. But the show is interesting and charming. You will like it too.
B003UU1UTC,jasper,5,The characters are excellent actors and this is an exciting series to watch.  I always look forward to the next episode.
B003UU1UTC,John T. foster,4,It is nice to see a fresh new show with some interesting stories. Good actors having fun with some interesting twists.
B003UU1UTC,Joycyln Kessler,4,At first I didn't think I would like it because the main female actress didn't seem to be strong enough for her part but I changed my mind after the first couple of shows.  It is something I am watching now and enjoying it.  Time well spent!
B003UU1UTC,Lauri Mannikko,3,There is something to say about a series that highlights the star with sex appeal and an ability to escape violent situations without any real chance to escape. I say it's okay as entertainment.
B003UU1UTC,N. Foley,5,Really enjoying this show. It is better than we expected and we look forward to each new season as it is added.
B003UU1UTC,Oscar E,5,This is a really good show. There is great character building and the writers have created good story lines. Can't wait to watch more!
B003UU1UTC,Pamela "pvs",5,I love Annie and I love Auggie. The rest of the cast is awesome too. This show is just so engaging and fun to following/ I love spy shows anyway. I can really picture myself going in on a case with these people. I love how much they care about each other. It is an uncommonly brilliant show.
B003UU1UTC,Richard Newton,1,I never made it to the first commercial break. This is a stupid vapid show. You can easily skip this one.
B003UU1UTC,Scott Dyer,4,I really like watching shows like this one after the other and not week after week.  I really like most of the characters and the star is gorgeous!
B003UU1UTC,Shannon J.,1,Way too cutesy and not very intelligent. Not believable. I guess I need some grit in my tv watching. Watch Alias instead.
B003UU1UTC,TL in SB,4,This show involves very appealing characters involved in entirely unrealistic spy adventures.  But it's really fun to watch each assignment progress.  When bad things happen the edge is taken off so the entire family can watch.  I would recommend this show to anyone.
B003UU1UTC,Tony,3,Nothing good or bad to say about this series.  It is just an average show.  If you are in to real drama go somewhere else
B003UU1UTC,Tumbleweed,4,My wife and I both watch it. It has some fairly decent writers. They leave a few holes in the logic but it is certainly entertaining.
B003UU1UTC,Value Shopper Pensacola,4,My husband and I both enjoy this program.  It has a good story line and a lot of action.  We are looking forward to watching more.
B003UU1UTC,William R. Smith "Bill Smith",4,The plots are interesting and entertaining but not rigorously believable and the cast is very likable. Sometimes the lead is too much of an airhead to be seriously CIA.
B003V61JUK,azloree,3,My husband enjoys the eye candy and this is an easy watch with minimal violence and some humor.  Don't have to think too hard or pay that close attention to it.
B003V61JUK,Bob,4,IT'S a basic detective story with a twist . THE hero's Quote &#34; people say I DON't play with people very well&#34; sets the tone of the show. His smart mouth and deduction skills makes the typical untypical. IT IS A FUN WATCH.
B003V61JUK,carl,4,we watched #1 and #2 and wanted to buy #3 but there was no available discs.  maybe you will have some later.
B003V61JUK,Carolyn Skinner08,4,I like the people and the story. I miss Florida so good to see it again.  Good looking guy too
B003V61JUK,Christine A. Rushbrook,5,This is a great cop show! The main character is quirky and fun. The co-stars play off the main character. I love this show
B003V61JUK,CO GIRL,5,I doubt that this show will win any critical acclaim but it sure is fun to watch.  I'm going to continue to watch all seasons.Sometimes all you want from a TV show is a TV show.  There's plenty of hard shows and hard news out there if you prefer more depressing
B003V61JUK,DEEZEE,5,A little humor with a good mystery. The characters are interesting and so far it has not become a total soap opera.
B003V61JUK,Dennis F. Elwell,5,I really enjoyed the great story line and he development of characters. The movie kept you interested. I highly ecommend the whole series to murder mystery buffs.
B003V61JUK,Donna,4,I like The Glades: The Complete First Season DVD.  It was nice to watch it again expecially with out commercials.
B003V61JUK,eaglegrafix,3,Glades is an enjoyable watch because the actors play interesting characters and do it well. The surprising thing is that after watching 4 shows I now know how to fully predict each story. The writer's formula is overly simplistic and repetitive.  Humor saves most scenes and in the middle of a weak thread we get to like the main characters and actually care about them. There just needs to be a bit more intrigue and mystery than currently exists.  We'll see how the seasons develop.
B003V61JUK,j,3,I like this show though it does mimic other shows in the genre and location. Once settled into the story it is entertaining and believable.
B003V61JUK,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,I think this is a very good show.  Love the main character.  I was so disappointed when A&E cancelled the series.  I am very pleased to be able to watch the series on Amazon Prime.
B003V61JUK,Katycaboose "Katty",3,Not too exited about this one.  Usual fair - chases and fights and gun shootings.  Feel .like have been there done that.
B003V61JUK,L Daughtridge,5,I just so enjoy the Glades series and am happy to have the beginnings. Now I can watch the new episodes coming up.
B003V61JUK,Leah,5,THE MAIN CHARACTER  IS GREAT. HE ALONE MAKES THIS SERIES WORTH WATCHING. INTERESTING TOPICS.
B003V61JUK,libbylab,5,This is one of my favorites and I was very glad to find it as an Amazon Prime offering.  My bias includes the fact that I spent my H.S. years in Ft. Lauderdale and was always fascinated by the Everglades.  Now I'm living in Florida again and still love the glades.  I really like this series even though many of the episodes are not set in the Glades at all.
B003V61JUK,LisserpieFamily,2,Sometimes a little slow on the stroy-- cant always &#34;like&#34; the charactersThe story lines are sometime slow & then predictable
B003V61JUK,Lizs Home Made,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this season. It is a good show. It does not have a lot of unsavory language or behavior.I  highly recommend this show!
B003V61JUK,mrs natural,5,This is a great series. We just decided to check it out and glad we did. It has a good story line and it entertaining. Working on the second season right now.
B003V61JUK,Peggy Carey,4,These are great shows to give yourself a good rest!  You'll find out you can't keep your eyes off and you always want more
B003V61JUK,Philip Logiudice,4,I have greatly enjoyed this series. In spite of the serious nature of the plot lines there is a lot of humor. I expect the next seasons (I have yet to watch) will show some improvements. Sometimes the Calle character is not too believable but hopefully that will change.
B003V61JUK,Phyllis DeSio,5,At first I did not know how I would like this program - however this really awesome show - can't wait until I see Season 2
B003V61JUK,Rebecca McCord,5,This is a fun show to watch at the end of the day. Lightweight and humorous .Good clean show.
B003V61JUK,Rene L. Hogan "R.L.Hogan",5,Great story line. Writers did not have to kill the program with a lot of gore to make the show believable.
B003V61JUK,Richard C. Anderson,5,Started watching this and got hooked on the characters.  Star-crossed lovers -- you know there is no way for something good to come of this.
B003V61JUK,Russell S,5,What can I say about this show. Matt Passmore is a genius..his timing is impeccable. I just love how his character is. He is a cross between Nate Filion and Columbo. Very handsome man.
B003V61JUK,S. Cowan,5,Great series. Police work with some twists and a lot of humor. I have really enjoyed this season and am looking forward to more.
B003V61JUK,Susan Crow,5,I enjoy most detective and police shows and this is no exception.  The characters and the story are both great.  I stay up at night to watch as many episodes as possible.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of show.
B003V61JUK,Virginia Yank,4,I like the characters.  A police drama mixed with some humor.  The plots are better than most. This series is well worth a look.
B003VDX6MW,ablatt123,5,Love this series!  Its suspenseful and full of surprises cant wait for the next ones to come out love it
B003VDX6MW,Book worm,5,This is a fresh new show.  It does not have a lot of filth in it that so many new shows have.
B003VDX6MW,Charity1230 "Charity",5,Love it. Glad it's available on Amazon.  Love the storylines and expecially think Lucas Bryant is an awesome and gorgeous actor!
B003VDX6MW,Christina Enness "Christina Cat",5,Haven is one of the best SyFy shows ever created and has such a constant theme going on. One of the best things about this show is that Agent Audrey Parker shows up and is not immediately accepted; she has to work her way into the community's heart and she does. This tv show is for anyone who likes a bit of mystery in their lives and enjoys being led on a merry chase.
B003VDX6MW,Diane S,5,Purchased season 2 & 3 because I loved the first season so much.  Was able to catch season 4 on TV sure hope there is going to be a season 5.
B003VDX6MW,Kathy Miller,5,I miss watching all seasons as I had to work in the evenings.  I bought all seasons so I can catch up.
B003VDX6MW,KELLY MCCRADIC,5,From the beginning this weird mysterious town caught my attention but once I learned more with each episode each story line had me hooked! Hoping for season 4 of the troubles.
B003VDX6MW,Kendyle McDaniel,5,I just recently bought and viewed this series and it is great.  Each episode is a treat itself with a strange mystery occuring and there is an underlying mystery in the town and for the lead female agent. I could not stop watching once I started.
B003VDX6MW,Larry McAuley,5,In all truth I started out not liking this show and I couldn't tell you why.  It was certainly right up my alley as far as the kind of shows I like goes.  But as I got further into the series I have found that the story lines have gotten better and better which is unusual for a TV show.  Usually they start weakening by the third season.  So I wanted to go back and rewatch fron the beginning.  Thanks to Amazon I am able to do that.
B003VDX6MW,Laura Fletcher "WOLF Women",5,I love Haven. The people are very interesting. I am just waiting for season 2 to come out on DVD so I can buy it.
B003VDX6MW,Lynn McBee,4,Not bad for a scifi series. Prefer Fringe due to character development and less predictable. It did finally improve the last couple of shows.
B003VDX6MW,Mary Ceparano,5,Haven is a awesome series. Stephen King is awesome. I love anything and everything Stephen King. I have all three seasons and they are all awesome.
B003VDX6MW,raisinets38,5,I happened upon this show and wow I was hooked.  Great characters and fun theme. I would like to see more.
B003VDX6MW,ROY,5,This is one show you will want to watch each week.. The first season quickly lead me into the second season and now awaiting to see if they will have a third season..
B003VKMZI6,B. E. Harkins "Billy in South Ga",2,I could only some much stand the commentary and then decided to turn it off. The cast of Mystery Science Fiction Theatre is good to a point but then ruined the movie.
B003VPM6TO,Deborah Branson "DB",4,Jam and Jerusalem is totally entertaining!  I smile and laugh the whole show.  I would reccomend this show to all womem over 40  :)  It is priceless.
B003VSTVC6,Derek Lowe "twerking the jalopy",1,I bought this once 2 years ago and will never buy again I can only watch on amazon or with amazon software and could never burn this is not buying or owning this is rentingAnd I'm not falling for it again this also why I don't buy from iTunes
B003VXMFY2,Holly Kubaskie,3,The series appears to end before much of anything is explained. It has its appeal. I figure it could have been better.
B003VXMFY2,M. A. Griffin,4,Enjoyed the first season and I hope there is a second.  I like the premises and hope a second season will explore more of that question. I also liked the actors as they portray the investigators who have to figure out &#34;what's going on&#34;.  This having been made more complex with the loss of one of the characters. Hmmm.....
B003WSA0TI,Lauren Michele,5,They don't receive nearly as much initial equipment and food.  Feels much more like living a true post apoc situation.
B003WSA0TI,Necrosis "Necrosis",5,Very interesting show that demonstrates valuable skills in a simulated emergency setting.  I really enjoyed watching both seasons and recommend them to others!
B003X1FPQM,Dickinson lover "Lit. nut",2,Just a little too dark to continue to watch.  The first one was okay but then the 2nd and 3rd one were just too depressing.  Too much psycho babble and know why it's called touching evil
B003X1FPQM,muddyboots,5,I found season 2 just as good as 1 and enjoyed all of the series.  The stories were gruesom and in some places hard to watch but I liked everything about the series.
B003X1FPQM,Rainyj,4,It was interesting to watch t.v. shows from Europe & how far shows have come from that time until now.
B003X1FPQM,Readerease,4,The characters in this drama are very well written and easy to relate to. I am watching British TV drama right now and this is one of the better of the new ones. Robson Green the actor who plays the main character is a bit over the top but after all he has been shot in the head and did die. Now is back on the job. I like the progression of each session. It is addictive.
B003XLHT1G,ChefRon,5,Good production and editing in the following of compelling true crime stories. Viewers follow the trail of evidentiary leads as law enforcement teams track murderers attempting to elude being identified and brought to justice.
B003XLHT1G,combs,5,I love to watch and see how they figure out who did it. It is amazing what gives the bad guy away.
B003XLHT1G,Gary D. Groves,4,This series uses a combination of reenactments and real recordings of criminal cases.  The actors really are similar looking to the criminals.  Real footage of trials are used.  Wish there was more than two years of it.
B003XLHT1G,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",4,my husband and I like true crime and mystery series and this one is good. We would love to see more new episodes of this. We might be in our 60s but we love the action packed drama/mystery scenario!
B003XLHT1G,Toby De La Pena,3,I enjoyed watching this program but would like to know if you will be adding more season? I really like watching these
B003XQK60W,C E Matthews,5,All my kids love this show. It is funny without being too over the top. Even though the series is over - they still like to watch past seasons!
B003XU02QG,A. R. St Jean "ARS",3,Highly fictionalized but entertaining if you enjoy this type of film. Not recommended for serious history buffs. Lots of action with the usual bad guys.
B003XU02QG,Barbara E. Blanco,5,It says 'guy movie' all over....great acting and story all together. will not disappoint for action. I suggest to the hubby for movie night every couple of months
B003XU02QG,Donkey,4,Great movie if you are into the Roman rule of times. Roman soldiers are trapped in an ambush and there is a traitor amongst them. Very harsh weather conditions push them back and the lone survivors end up being on the run hunted down by the enemy. The Romans are off to kill the last Knight because he could be a threat to Roman rule and he has nowhere to go.....almost! Pretty gory battles!
B003XU02QG,Dreamcat,3,It was entertaining enough to keep me hooked throughout the movie. I love history so I watched the for the historical aspect of it. The movies accurate in it's portrayal of brutal times of the Roman conquest and of its losses in that conquest.
B003XU02QG,Ron Baker,4,Surviving Roman battles was easier than surviving Roman politics. A betrayed Roman Centurion is betrayed by his superiors and must escape to survive after his Legion is destroyed. Entertaining for those entertained by the Roman era.
B003XU02QG,Stuart Miller,5,I am so glad I came across this movie! There was pretty much  non-stop action from beginning to end. This movie is definitely my favorite list.
B003XU02QG,TomSkirrett "Captain",2,After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising.  It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing.  It's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running.  There's really not much of a plot.  If you're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives.  This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short.  Don't waste your money.
B003Y5QRJ6,Donkey,4,This movie kept my interest up. It had a lot of action in it and to find out who are really the bad guys wasn't too hard at all until near the end. I was totally wrong on  who was in on stealing the money. Worth a look at. Acting is OK but not great.
B003Y5QRJ6,Kathleen,2,I watched it to the end. Who ever wrote this had no insite into human behavior. The blond was good looking had a presence. And beat Hilary in acting but that was not saying much. the story line was extremely weak. The blond should have knowin his big mouth friend was talking. there was no other way they would know about him. I mean there are a hell of a lot of blond men with pony tails. lol And he had a big mouth. I also noticed that he had no gun shot wound in the pool scean > Bad writing Bad directing. And the minute a bad guy came on the scean you knew he was bad. The only knowen people where the bad guys as usual in a bad movie.
B003Y5QRJ6,Michael Cooper,4,This was actually a pretty good movie and it has some mysterious qualities to it that become more apparent towards the middle.
B003Y5QRJ6,Roger Heumann,3,This movie is about bad guys (and girls). It ends. The plot is so thin that you know who the bad guys are from the beginning.
B003YDOYVG,Flannel Quilter,5,Everyday when I got home from school I watched schoolhouse rock. It amazes me how many of the songs I remember. Kids today should have a look at these.
B003YDOYVG,gustavo a lopez,5,If you were a kid in the 70's then you should rememeber these classics. I still have them ingrained in my head and actually come in handy once in a while. Also love the great vocals by Jack Shelton and Bob Durough. Both Jazz stars of their own. ABC should bring them back
B003YDOYVG,Kelly Carlton,5,I always like these when I was a child and can even remember most of the words! and they are educational.
B003YF84MY,Alvin Oliver,5,It took my wife and I quite awhile to decide if the team was composed of good cops or bad cops.  The decision was difficult to make so I believe that added a uniqueness to the series that we really enjoyed.As opposed to a lot of cop shows this one kept a thread going for several episodes and that made us hungry for the next one which was different from a cliff hanger.We put this series as #1 on our top 10 all time cop shows.
B003YF84MY,D. Campbell,5,Too bad they didn't keep this series going. Good acting and very intense. I suppose it's too late to bring on season 3.
B003YF84MY,Happy Flamingo,5,I really enjoyed this series and would recommend to anyone who likes dramas. It is a Cia with in the Police department. sorta like real day cowboys. I did not realize i watched the second season first and it did not matter. all the story lines were very good.
B003YF84MY,Mike,5,This show is entertaining great cast over all great stories and always leaves you wanting more and Irish it still came on television.
B003YF84MY,mlstillman,5,This was a wonderful series with talented actors and awesome storylines.  I hate when a show is cancelled after a clifhanger season ending. I wish they would have at least done one or two more episodes to give us closure.
B003YF84MY,victoria,4,This is a more realistic series. We enjoy tuning in to see what will happen next. I like Dean he's a perfect undercover guy. His accent his body language and his street wise attitude.
B003YKC4BG,Boulder Mike,4,Stumbled into this movie after watching Hansel and Gretel. I thought Gretel is a great and sexy actress and wanted to check out other movies. She is definitely hot in this movie..the story and other actors are somewhat lame and it takes dedication to watch the movie to the end. Still great scenes with Gretel..reason for the 4 stars.
B003YUGS6S,E. Yeager,3,This is a silly cartoon that teaches nothing. Why does the bull have udders and no horns? However the grandkids like it. Therefore the three stars instead of one.
B003YUGS6S,Howard Roberson,4,Alittle corny but it held their attention to the end.
B003YUGS6S,L. Greene,5,This is one of the few shows that we enjoy watching with our toddler.  He loves it and always wants the &#34;cow&#34; show!
B003YUGS6S,@margaret,5,I like this cartoon series. I laughed out loud a lot. I also watched the second season and it was good also.
B003YUGS6S,thomas marcelain,5,I love this show and the movie and to be able to watch lots of episodes with my son i even enjoy watching it with him.
B003ZHOWFY,dulcibell "dulcibell",5,So sorry there are no more seasons. Especially love Nessa and Pam! Excellent acting and clever scripts... Can't ask for more. Loved it!
B003ZHOWFY,L J Johnston,4,This is a very funny series! So many quirky personalities & great interaction between  them. I will be watching it again.
B003ZHOWFY,MargyL "MargyL",4,This series gets better and better with each season.  The creators have wicked funny senses of humor and the characters are so well cast
B003ZHOWFY,Spalmer,5,This show continues to be one of the freshest shows ever--Gavin and Stacey are great--but Smithy and 'Nessa are priceless.
B003ZHOWFY,techie mike,5,Not a bad banana in the bunch... this is a fantastic show and excellent actors doing a magnificent job... Entertainment at it's best!
B003ZVO6JW,B. Seymour "Kudzuman",4,John Cleese makes the show. He is brilliant in his delivery of comedic and acerbic wit! He makes the show in my opinion. What a great actor and comedian!
B003ZVO6JW,Carolyn Skinner08,5,The comedy is very slap stick and the character are very interesting  I really think I have said enough thanks
B003ZVO6JW,Darlene,5,There has never been a funnier sitcom in the history of television!  Basil cannot help but to dig himself deeper and deeper.  He says what he means and means what he says.  Too funny!  I wish he had made more episodes!
B003ZVO6JW,Duffer513,4,Zany British comedy at its best.  John Cleese  direct from Monty Python is a slapstick master! Too bad there are so few episodes!
B003ZVO6JW,G. Higley,4,Solid four star entertainment for comedy lovers.  Great cast and good writing.  One of the all time classic series.  What a pity it only lasted two seasons.
B003ZVO6JW,mary,2,the show is to noisey and each episode is really the same if you have seen one show you have basicly seen them all
B003ZVO6JW,Mary Spangler,5,Faulty Towers is an awesome PBS show. John Cleese and the rest of the bumbling staff at the Hotel Faulty Towers are great for some laughs. The things He is always trying to hide from his wife to no avail. She always catches on and he is left trying to get out of his own predicaments... awesome show. great laughs.
B003ZVO6JW,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",4,Hilarious classis British comedy.  Cleese is great but I enjoy all the characters.  I wish there were many more seasons!
B003ZVO6JW,Michael L. Lowenstein,5,What could I say a crazy british comedy about a hotel with a great cast.  Most of shows are very funny. Fawity's wife is something else to behold.
B003ZVO6JW,mompantero,5,One of my favorite British comedies even though a bit dated. A very funny series that we enjoy a lot.
B003ZVO6JW,Steve1290,4,John Cleese is one of the funniest people on earth.  I wonder whether there were actual scripts for this old show.
B003ZVO6JW,Tom,5,They don't make shows like this anymore; they stand the test of time and they never get old no matter how may times you watch them. Great fun!
B003ZVO6JW,Winfred crowe,5,The whole cast and guest's create a program that it's hard imigaine that they only had two seasons. Not enough.
B00406OXAI,Book Lover "CYN",5,I love the Agatha Christie's Poirot Series for season 11. David Suchet is such a marvelous actor and his portrayal of Poirot is wonderful. I love to be able to stream the series whenever I am ready to watch it. I highly recommend this series and streaming video.
B00406OXAI,CO GIRL,5,I'm crazy about Poirot.  I watch any I can and will continue to do so.  I was sorry to see that some of the seasons are pay per view but I watch all that are included in Prime.
B00406OXAI,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",4,What's not to like about these stories and characters. Well if Capt Hastings and Inspector Jepp were in them it would get 5 stars.And these episodes are longer than the original series. Worth watching -- I hope Amazon switches some more of the later series to PRIME.
B00406OXAI,galaxy1,5,the actor playing  Poirot is the best ever!..plays the part with such freshness..one always enjoys watching every episode..Agatha Christie's writing is always perfect..timeless..
B00406OXAI,Joan,5,Season 11 only has 4 stories as well as Season 6 but again they are some of her best works. Each story lasts close to two hours and will keep you guessing &#34;Who done it&#34; until the very end.
B00406OXAI,kindlelover,5,If you love Hercules Poirot you will  love Season 11. Costumes and period accuracy amazing and Poirot in fine form as always.
B00406OXAI,L. Grueneberg,5,I am saddened to realize that this is the last season available through Prime.  I would wish that all seasons produced were available.  What an enjoyable series.  Wished also that I had realized that at the time it was available on tv.  Mr Poirot continues his solving ways that amaze me.  I love the locations which add to the story. Thank you!
B00406OXAI,Michael L. Lowenstein,5,This season featured some longer shows . These were well done with very interesting plots with a fine cast of actors.
B00406OXAI,Millicent Washington "Mickey",5,He makes every case suspenseful and see's what no other's take for granted. I wish there were more episodes available - in the meantime I'll keep watching what's available. :)
B00406OXAI,M. Webster "None",5,I have enjoyed this series for many years.
B00406OXAI,Pat Choate,5,These later seasons of Poirot are really the best of the run.  Poirot is portrayed as the author intended and the filmography is excellent.
B00406OXAI,Patricia A. Jones "Bookworm",5,Most entertaining Poirot around.  Longtime fan of Agatha Christie in print or tv presentations.  My favorite detective of 20th century.
B00406OXAI,REGRETFUL,5,Poirot is at once amusing and ingenious in his handling of the various mysteries that engage him. beautifully filmed andthe vintage locations are alone worth watching.
B00406OXAI,shirley,5,I rate this all the way because H.P. is a legend of his own when it comes to detectives.  This series was too short. I see he is aging and no longer requires his associate Mr. Hastings but he still solves the cases in his unique way. I recommend this to all who love a good mystery solved in only ways Poirot can.
B00406OXAI,S. Lee "waterwoman39",5,I don't think I can be objective.  I love Christies stories and David Suchet is the perfect Poirot.  If you know what all that means you will enjoy this series.
B0040H8FBU,Jessica L Meyer,5,This show has the perfect amount of fun and drama. The characters all have good chemistry. I think it has an appeal for several types of viewers. Great characters. Excellent female leads.
B0040H8FBU,N. Rude,5,Awesome show!! Makes you want to watch one episode right after the other! I highly recommend this show and season to everyone!
B0040HNZTW,&#34;The Book Crone&#34;,4,Lark Rise to Candleford  is tame and the pace is definitely not rapid.  It is a leisurely walk through the late 1800's where small problems of two towns and their inhabitants (with an emphasis on class) are reviewed.  The people's lives and issues can be taken as an allegory about how the world at large was changing.
B0040HNZTW,Amazon Customer,5,If Victorian chick flicks are your cup of tea then this is a good one. These stupid reviews have a minimum word requirement so this content was added.
B0040HNZTW,Anne,3,Interesting to see how people lived in small English town years ago. Characters are real with everyday & sometimes petty problems. Warm & easy to watch
B0040HNZTW,Barbara,4,My husband and I enjoyed watching these shows after my daughter-in- law and granddaughter recommended them. I think they are watch worthy.
B0040HNZTW,Bekka "Bekka",5,Very good family show. Fun characters and interesting story plots. Seems to be fairly period correct for anyone looking for that  sort of thing. Love it!!!
B0040HNZTW,beth holman,5,I enjoyed the 40 part show the people all were interesting.  New show each time.  I wish it would of gone liner.  I recommend it to all.
B0040HNZTW,Blue isle #3,4,The characters were believable and drew me into each quest they set forth in doing. I wanted to watch more just to see how they were going to end. At the end of each episode there seemed to have a surprise...and I could not wait to see what was next.
B0040HNZTW,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",5,Lark Rise to Candleford is worth a look see.  I quickly became engrossed in this wonderful period dramas. Only Downton Abbey can rivel it's quality.
B0040HNZTW,Bonnie Chinnick,5,This series reminds me of a British version of Little House on the Prairie.  I really enjoy the portrayal of the class system and how hard it was to break out of the structure.
B0040HNZTW,B's Mom,5,I really enjoy watching period dramas.  This one is especially nice with the colorful costumes and equally colorful characters.  Love it!
B0040HNZTW,Carolyn D. Smith,4,Really good character development.  Makes you want to be a part of their lives.  The stories will warm you to the bone and tug at your heartstrings.  If you like heartwarming period pieces this is it.
B0040HNZTW,Cathy,5,All the characters are so well developed thru out the episodes. You want to come back and see the next installment. I am a big fan of this kind of series.
B0040HNZTW,Chip,4,I give it a four because I am new to series and don't yet know about it's staying power to keep me interested. It does have some great characters and extremely talented actors.
B0040HNZTW,Colleen Gregory,5,I am enjoying this series and look forward to seeing how their lives unfold from show to show. Thankful for good shows to entertain that have good morals.
B0040HNZTW,CornDawg,5,Good wholesome watching; ideal for family. The show develops its characters to the point you can't help but falling in love with all of them. Beautiful setting. Please consider watching....really worth it!
B0040HNZTW,CTM,5,This series is soothing; if you want a relaxing enjoyable down to earth country style living this is a great desires to watch. It also is very entertaining. If you  are an older person an lived in times of simple living this is for you!!!
B0040HNZTW,DMT,5,I LOVE THIS SERIES AND WISH THEY WOULD BRING IT BACK - JUST WENT YOU GET INTO IT THERE ARE NO MORE EPISODES
B0040HNZTW,Elizabeth D. Janz,5,Another great BBC series.  I was sad to see it come to an end.  I would recommend if you liked Little House on the Prairie type shows.
B0040HNZTW,Ellyn M. Renken,5,There is no better entertainment that can be had than that made in England.  I am now on Season 2 of this series and love every minute of it!  Pure entertainment and not the constant physical conflicts of American films.  Give me more like this!
B0040HNZTW,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,We loved this series.  The acting was outstanding.  Each actor/actress was so well-cast for their roll.  The writing for this series is exceptional.  We couldn't wait to watch each episode.
B0040HNZTW,Gale A. Cleaves,5,This is a charming story with wonderful characters and the delictdful Dorcas is beautifully done. I can't wait tk see where the story takes me in each episode. I hope BBC will continue thF story.
B0040HNZTW,HFC,5,This a wonderful BBC series.  I am enjoying watching every episode.  It's about a time when communities functioned together in real support of one another.  Mrs. HFC
B0040HNZTW,Hrothgar,2,While a  pretty period piece the pace is so slow interest fades fast. Can't figure out how this could have run for two seasons.
B0040HNZTW,IMHO "IMHO",4,This show reminds me of little house on the prairie.It's a very high quality period comedy with some great writing.
B0040HNZTW,Inter Axion Inc. "Word Smith",2,This series follows the tradition of off-setting the less appealing consequences of the modernization of rural towns and villages with copious drafts of traditional &#34;wisdom&#34; and &#34;old-fashioned common sense.&#34; And there is no villager more &#34;saintly&#34; in imparting both the latter than the yeoman played by Brendan Coyle. Unfortunately the tensions created by modernity are all too familiar to most viewers hence the series struggles to maintain sufficient tension for us to care about the outcomes.
B0040HNZTW,JCraul,5,only one season made but it was a good story line and i enjoyed it.  The last episode ended well.... no cliff hanger.
B0040HNZTW,Jenny,4,As always this show is well acted...It is what you would think real life was back then of the poor and well of people
B0040HNZTW,J. lavine "suzl",4,this is a fun series to watch and relax to. the story line is interesting and each chapter is fun
B0040HNZTW,Joan M. Poole,5,Truly enjoyed this series and watched it up to the 4th but was left hanging.  Wish the TV stations wouldn't do this all the time.
B0040HNZTW,Karin Foglesong Moody,4,Watching this production is like taking a lovely vacation to a different place and time where the struggles are real but they are different than those we face today.
B0040HNZTW,Kindle Customer,4,This is a charming portrait  of  ordinary people in England - Lark Rise and Candleford.  Lark Rise is not as forward thinking as Candleford during this time period.  The story is gentle and  compelling and moves quietly along developing the personalities and character traits of the stations in life of the various people.
B0040HNZTW,Lois Langston,5,This is one of the best series I've seen. I could hardly wait to see the next episode. The characters are truly believable in their portrayals of the country way of living in the beautiful English countryside. Perfectly cast are each and everyone of the characters. I highly recommend seeing all the seasons.
B0040HNZTW,lorrie lennon,1,I've not been able to watch this as  I keep getting error messages from Amazon! I don't have problems with any other movie subscriptions except for the Prime free. Very disappointing :(
B0040HNZTW,Margaret L. Albright,5,I love English tv programs this is know exception it was very enjoyable. Will probably watch the whole season again.
B0040HNZTW,Maximilian K. Biltz,5,One of the better small-town 19th century dramas which BBC has produced. It is akin to Downton Abbey though looking at a whole village rather than one family.
B0040HNZTW,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,i love costume dramas especially English ones.  They are a gentle reminder of how life was back in the day and how people lived life and loved and had fun while doing it.
B0040HNZTW,Paula Jankowski,5,Never heard of it and watch the whole thing in one nightDid not go to sleepcould not quite watching gave a great message
B0040HNZTW,Ruth in Salt Lake City,4,Very well written. Its' fun to see whats going to happen in these small related towns in England. All of the interpersonal relationships are well executed and the acting is top notch.
B0040HNZTW,sao,4,I did not read the books but this is an interesting story so far. I watch it from time to time. Not addicting but good
B0040HNZTW,Savannah,4,This series has an abundance of interesting characters and the stories are varied and interesting.  They people of Lark Rise and Candleford quickly become your friends.  An interesting  and entertaining glimpse of the past.
B0040HNZTW,shelly,5,I find this series very refreshing I love it ! and watch it over and over  very family friendly viewing!
B0040HNZTW,Suzanne Fisher,5,Enjoyed it immensely. And I would highly recommend it to my friends and family. It was well done and very entertaining. The actors were marvelous.
B0040HNZTW,swims2me,4,This is a great family show. The cast is wonderful. You'll recognize actors from your favorite BBC series past and present.
B0040HNZTW,tin man,4,Interesting story line. The characters are real-life and shows good and bad of persons actions. Hope this show will continue for sometime.
B0040XE8KG,combs,5,Wow you have to wonder do people like this really exist? It is crazy how strange some people can be.
B0040XE8KG,muddyboots,2,I thought this was a series and didn't realize it was a reality show.  For some this might be entertainment but not for me.
B004126A1G,Amazon Customer "Hooked",5,This was an excellent show! why was it cancelled? All the best shows are taken off. Too bad...I can name several shows still on the  air that could be taken off. I wish there had been more episodes. The nudity was almost non existent.Excellent Show! Too bad it didn't make it.
B004126A1G,A. M. Bonito,4,I'm only into the first 4 shows so far but it's moving along pretty well and worth watching. I would recommend it.
B004126A1G,barb dellesky,5,So many twists and turns.  Love the lead characters.  How they succeed is inspiring. Beware.  The good guys may be bad and vice-versa.or are they?
B004126A1G,bdeath,5,Was entertaining to me. Good characters and interaction between them. Ranks right up there with Grim. Lots of shows don't get my attention. This one was worth the watch. Also so is falling skies and defiance.
B004126A1G,beth holman,5,A very good show about aliens.  A recommend. It to all adults.  Amazon you need to buy more seasons.the actors are top notch.
B004126A1G,BK Perea,5,Like reading a book. Can't wait to get to the next chapter.  Wish there was a season two.  Ended way too soon.
B004126A1G,Captain Caption,3,Would easily get four stars if they hadn't cut it off after one season. Talented cast and a suspense filled plot line made it exciting. Another poor decision at the 'suits' level of network television. Remember &#34;Flash Forward?&#34;
B004126A1G,Dancy Girl,4,Very fast paced and out of this world.  Liked the characters.  Look forward to season 2 with all its twists and turns of outer space aliens.
B004126A1G,Debra Brodersen,5,I wish they had further seasons.  Disappointed when I can't finish watching the show to its conclusion.  Sometimes the streaming is so slow that it stops every 5 minutes.
B004126A1G,Dennis P. Reap,5,It was a great beginning with a lot of potential. That the series was not granted more than one season is unfortunate.
B004126A1G,designer,5,This story has allot of plots and twists and turns.  You never know what is coming next.The president is put in a most difficult position.....don't want to give it away......  :-)
B004126A1G,diane,5,The Event was an on the edge of your seat movie.  I enjoyed the entire cast. At first I was sorry there was only one season but looking back it feels complete.
B004126A1G,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",4,Haven't figured out where it is going. Hope I find more. Ends with the idea that disaster is looming. What?
B004126A1G,flyfish,4,Story line is a grabber once you get into it....Always want to know what is next....I think it is suitable viewing for most..Unless you just think aliens are bunk altogether...
B004126A1G,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Great show!  We really enjoyed watching it!  Thought the acting and story was fascinating.  Looking forward to watching Season 2!
B004126A1G,greg,1,It was mind numing. It had no draw for my atention atr all. sad really. blah blah blah blahza. did n't care for it.
B004126A1G,jim jones,5,Loved it can not wait to watch season 2 I hope their is a next one!!!!!!!!!I If not thanks AMAZON great show
B004126A1G,Jim Martin,5,Apparently they never told the writers that there was not going to be a second season so they ended the program with a whole lot of unanswered questions which would have been answered had there been a second season. The network killed this show by starting it on a certain night in a certain time slot then give it a three week break and when they restarted it they put it on a different night in a different time slot and then justify cancelling the program due to its small viewing audience even though it had a fairly large viewing audience originally.
B004126A1G,J. N. McCarthy,5,I was captivated and my interest kept on.  I am looking forward to the new season and hope it is available soon.
B004126A1G,Ken,4,This is an interesting twist on the alien invasion story.  Was looking to see what the next season was going to have.It does wrap it up but leaves it open to so much more.
B004126A1G,Mgriffin2312,5,Loved it! Really sucky that theirs only one season and a HUGE cliffhanger! Would love a continuation of some kind!
B004126A1G,NC. movie man,3,To many back flashes to suit me. The story line is very good but just get on with the show.
B004126A1G,neko712,5,I watched The Event while running on my treadmill.  It was so enthralling that I hardly noticed the work.  I found it hard to stop the video when I finished.
B004126A1G,Rburch,1,Very slow start to whatever plot they are attempting to build?? Acting is sub par. Could not even make it past 30 minutes of the pilot.
B004126A1G,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,This series was originally suggested by a friend.  I found myself hooked after the first episode.  It's a totally unique premise about aliens invading our society and the repercusions associated with both 'good' and 'bad' alien influence.  The action and all around 'feel' of this series is excellent.  I appreciated the character development and interactions of the people starring in this series. I also appreciated the minimal special abilities of the aliens.  I find it to be very believeable.  Highly recommended series.
B004126A1G,Robert Wittenburg "hardbags dot com",5,This show is so well written that I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy it. I recommend it to everyone
B004126A1G,Rock Fossil "wacowayne",4,Sci-fy development is excellent. The temporatory suspension of disbelief is easily accomplished. Some of the writing between the two young lovers leaves a lot to be desired. This program is much better that a lot of the fare launched reciently.
B004126A1G,Rocking Rod,4,Good series although a little over the top scientifically speaking. But that's why it's Sci. Fiction. I enjoyed it and am awaiting the next season.
B004126A1G,salt94,5,I enjoyed the series. It had a good blend of story lines and kept up my interest. To bad it did not continue.
B004126A1G,Sherry A. Mccall,3,so far it has not made much of an inpression on me as a sifi series hope for better soon.
B004126A1G,S. Lee "waterwoman39",3,I found it trite and the characters immature.  12 more words required about something I basically disliked but was able to tolerate.  In truth I left the room a lot.
B004126A1G,Sproutsmom,5,I have a Roku player so I was able to watch this show from beginning to end in one weekend. Awesome.
B004126A1G,Steven Roach,5,good show
B004126A1G,Ted,5,I really liked the series and the cast and the story line and like so many other reviewers I am disappointed that there is no second season.  I wish another network would continue with it.
B004126A1G,Teresa P.,5,I watched this show when it originally came on tv. I loved it! Then they canceled it after one season. We were left hanging. I wish they would have made a movie that at least gave us some closure.
B004126A1G,Timothy J. Gannon,3,like a middle section of the xfiles without the moulder scully chemistry. the young girl is portrayed as too irrational and the young man too lucky.
B004128RXU,Don Montgomery,2,there wasn't anything that made me have any empathy for the victims. just a bunch of whiny people mad because their less than stellar behavior reaped bad results. welcome to the real world---oh and it does rain in southern California.
B0041FW1BG,Divawn,5,My children enjoyed this movie; they played it over and over. They even learned the songs and danced to the music.
B0041FW1BG,marymurban,3,I thought it was the movie. Grandkids were not particularly interested in how the movie was made. They are - twins 5 boy and girl. Plus 3 year old girl.
B0041GKKNG,Amazon Customer "Grumpy",5,I play the Fresh Beat videos for my little 3 year old Granddaughter and she's glued to the screen for minutes on end. She just loves it.
B0041GKKNG,Tiana Kennemur,5,FBB always gets my kids up and dancing!  It has also created a love for music so that they enjoy practicing their instruments now.
B0041H3TQA,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",4,If you have seen them before you will like this special and the characters that they revive. It's not for everybody.
B0041R9PX6,bernie "xyzzy",4,Occasionally somebody comes along and finds unique way to look at life. Some of these people with different types of insights get published. This presentation is based on a popular book by the same name "Freakonomics". The title might be a bit misleading it's really about incentives and misleading statistics.Here Freakonomics takes the discipline down to the individual I have already had several economics courses that showed things such as all world history including wars and even the U.S. Constitution can be boiled down to economic incentives. So the economic concept is not new but applying it to individual cases or other disciplines is what makes this presentation unique.As with all concepts there is no way that you can cram the whole theory from the book into an hour and a half program. So here we get a superficial overview which does not quite live up to the standards. I was really impressed when the program started out with the section on real estate; they showed what I always suspected. The section on cheating was pure statistics and not as impressive but useful. The section on parenting was a little dragged out and not quite as focused; however I did find the part on getting kids names interesting. The section on incentives showed nothing new however I could name a few people that could learn something from this feeling. The section on cause and effect pretty much wraps up the concepts that are trying to be presented here.I suggest you listen to the commentary as it gives some insight as to what is trying to be accomplished in the presentation(s). Why they picked different directors and so forth. Filmmakers will find this interesting.
B0041R9PX6,Daniel Cohen,4,I actually used the portion about housing to get a fair and timely sale on my parents' home. The realtor wanted them to jump at all offers; we waited for fair offers. The segment on Sumo was fascinating. 4 stars because the segment about names was overly drawn out in my opinion.
B0041R9PX6,E J Peak,4,Probably the best bit of research is the drop off in abortions after the demise of the dictator who forced people to have unwanted children in order to create a labor force artificially. There is certainly much one can learn about the intertwining of economics and social research.
B0041R9PX6,Jane Garmon,5,I enjoyed this clip so much I was disappointed it was not longer.  Now I have to read the book after the tease. Excellent information .
B0041R9PX6,Rose Norman,4,Watched this while cooking and found that several episodes made me want to stop and sit down to watch.  The fact that it's divided into episodes makes it good for short viewings.  Have not finished watching it.  Did read the book and like it.
B0041R9PX6,Steve Jameson,5,A wide range of interesting social and societal topics using empirical evidence to support or debunk various 'facts' and myths.Loved watching it and think it should be required for e everyone!
B00426035K,A Everett,5,This is a thinking person's crime thriller.  Helen Mirren is exceptional as Jane Tennyson.  Could take my eyes off this!
B00426035K,Dancy Girl,4,Helen Mirren was especially good in this series.  She is elevated to the position of lead detective after the death of the former.  She is the first female to hold this position and is not accepted as competent to lead by the squad.  She proves them wrong after working the case and solving the murders.This is a show that women will love.  It proves that given a chance. they are as competent as the men and very devoted to getting the job done.The acting is especially good and the suspense builds throughout the episodes.
B00426035K,David,4,This show from the 1990's is still a great show - it lets you see why Helen Mirren is such a great actress - it is much better than the Law and Order shows and the other crime series that are on TV today
B00426035K,Julzweaver "Julzweaver",4,What a treat to watch a great actress portray such a believable and flawed character in a television series. Can't wait to watch more.
B00426035K,Lorraine M. Jessee,4,Good British drama series.  Good Start for Season 1 and I was impressed with Helen Mirren's character both personal and work related.
B00426035K,Max Mustang,5,A look inside the person & organization. Another Masterpiece from the UK.  A most watch series. Gritty at times but realistic. A must Watch for the purist. Recommended W/O reservation.
B00426035K,sharon kemm,5,Helen Mirren is absolutely the best actress. her character is thorough and  professional  the cast is as in real life-sometimes respectful of their bosses and oft times not.
B00426035K,Stacie M Guy,5,Helen Mirren portrays the character of Dectective Jane Tennyson as a conflicted yet dedicated cop in this first installment of Prime Suspect.  Great story line and great character.
B00426035K,William Gustafson,4,Helen Mirren does her usual good acting job.  A crime show where the police do not carry guns.  That is marvelous.
B004263SAM,A Everett,5,Helen Mirren draws us into her character and expands her depth with her extraordinary acting.  Supporting cast keeps pace with her.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ride!
B004263SAM,catthief,5,Tells me the story of the solving of the cases not the life of the detectives themselves.  I am so tired of living in these shows bedrooms and this one just sticks to the facts.  A pleasure to watch the cases being solved.
B004263SAM,David,5,Shows the struggles that went on in the 1990's in the British Police - a real portrayal of a system that was out of dateHelen Mirren is a great actress
B004263SAM,Sadcelticlady,5,Helen murres is a fine actress ! This series never grows old ! Have enjoyed it over and over again .
B004263SAM,Stacie M Guy,5,Helen Mirren continues her fine portrayal of Inspector Jane Tennyson.  This episode provides more glimpses into Jane Tennysons conflicted life.  Still a gripping series.
B0044BY98K,Belinda Roman,5,This is a deceptive film whose real point is how do we live with our southern neighbors. Like the matter of fact attitude.
B0044BY98K,Ekay,2,The storyline & premise had the potential to be really interesting but to me it was a rambling movie that was hard to track the intent of the characters and the bordering countries. Also the monster's seemed to have their own agenda but that wasn't clearly defined. Not a fan of the production values or editing either.
B0044BY98K,Judy B,3,This movie (Monsters) was okay...it kept my interest but too much was unexplained and left up to my limited imagination.
B0044BY98K,Lolo,3,the movie was about monsters that are foreign to us and how the governments  and people decide to react to the situation
B0044BY98K,M S SELIGMAN "pistolera",2,Story had no suspense.  Direction was not entertaining.  A dud.  Don't waste your time.  I couldn't watch it.  A dud.
B0044BY98K,putder53,2,THE MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. TO ME IT WAS MORE  A LOVE STORY.  THERE WAS SOME INTERSTING SIGHTS. BUT ALL IN ALL NOT MY KNID OF A MOVIE.
B004520KTU,Annette Delaney,4,I've only watched the first episode but it definitely caught my interest.  The characters are funny and down to earth.  I especially liked the random ways each family member discovered his/her super power.  I look forward to watching more episodes!
B004520KTU,Borat's Bad Brother,4,It would appear that there's no room for any more sci-fi on television! Really. "V" and "The Event" are gone. All that's left now is "Fringe" and now "Falling Skies"! Falling Skies may not even get a second season let alone a complete first season. We'll see. Same for the comming "Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome".Sci-fi is going the way of veriety shows(extinction) and soon no network will even bother putting out a science fiction product. Not unless we pay for it "directly"!
B004520KTU,CATRYNA,5,I love this show but what in the world was going on in episode 4 with the floppy. Doesn't this corporation have thumb drives or memory cards?
B004520KTU,Julia A. Antoon "shamoonya",5,I was very disappointed that the series was cancelled.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Love the two main characters in this series.Love ordering my favorite TV shows and movies from Amazon.com
B00459EZ7Q,Adam Silvia,5,This show combines drama with sci-fi action that builds a well written plot and storyline. It's a shame that SGU is not coming back for a third season.
B00459EZ7Q,al,5,my brother seems to like this TV series a lot.  He is a big fan.  the condition seemed to be in great condition when it came.
B00459EZ7Q,Amazon Customer,3,I enjoyed the first season until the last episode.  What is it with following the 'GOD' signal through the Universe?  I thought this series was about seeing the 'GODS' as false and that the ancients were the ones really go all this 'GOD' work.  I can see why this series was canceled.  Maybe sense they set the stage for this to be revisited in 2014.  I can see where they talk able the each part of the journey being needed before the next step is taken.  This is a very Buddhist approach to a journey.  I hope the movie where they re-visit this in 2014 improves the story line.
B00459EZ7Q,car992,5,Second season while still dark (seldom anything ever going their way) they still manage to survive.  I'm sure anyone that watched this would have liked to see at least one more show (someone should make a movie) to show them making it back home.
B00459EZ7Q,David J. Riffle "TV dude",5,Like reading a cool SciFi/fantasy novel where the underlying theme is about networks killing off TV shows like mindless drones set in force by some unknown beings from long ago. Maybe there will be a rebirth of this show after the suspended animation wears off.
B00459EZ7Q,David S. Cowan,4,Do sad they stopped production at 2 seasons.  The producers had finally taken the corny and juvenile schlock our of the Star Gate franchise and given us an Adult Show with complex chatacters and then...  And then...  Some doofus pulled the plug!  So sad!  My wife and I really enjoyed binge streaming Sg-U for the second time.  Very enjoyable characters and story line - though rescuing Chloe gets tedious!!!  The other characters remained engaging.  Sorry it ended so abruptly!
B00459EZ7Q,eric matheny,5,The best scifi show since enterprise.For some reason this series really turned out to leave me hanging on the edge .
B00459EZ7Q,Kat Kay "Kat Kay",5,As much as I love this series the buyer should be aware that Amazon is slow in downloading the videos where you buy a season pass.  If you want it fast you should choose ITunes.  They are quicker.
B00459EZ7Q,lremick,5,I really like science fiction especially about space exploration. I wish that one more season had been made showing  they returned to earth or found another planet habital to live.
B00459EZ7Q,Oldsoldier22 "Chief3lw",4,Season 1 was okay this 2d season is more of the same. The character development is over done in my opinion. It takes backstabbing and undermining of leadership to a high level than I can appreciate. The story line is a good one but overload on the character conflicts takes away from the story. I'm stuck watching it myself because the conflicts take away from the story. A Sci-Fi fiend may appreciate the conflict but I didn't.
B00459EZ7Q,setzco,4,I liked the final season better they started to lose the everyone out for themselfs and screw everybody else attitude and started becoming more like the rest of StarGate were almost everyone is really a hero in the end looking to everyone else's interest and putting themselfs after the others.  I found this season much more inline with the StarGate Universe and would have continued watching if they'd have continued the series down this line.
B00459EZ7Q,Stanley Cook,5,This was an outstanding adventure from the Stargate series. It is a shame they never brought it back for series 3. They left it with an ending but in a direction they could have but sense it ended in 2011 I doubt it.
B00459EZ7Q,T.C.,5,This is a VERY high quality SCI-FYI show.  There is no need to have already watched previous Stargate shows to enjoy this one as well. The only sad thing is that MGM went broke during its run and it was shelved years too early.
B00459EZ7Q,Ted Robbins,5,The concepts along with great casting and writing make this one of the best sci-fi series ever presented. I  am a life long sci-fi fan(not easily impressed) and  am currently engaged in watching this series for the second time. It's one for the ages.Don't miss it!
B00459EZ7Q,Theresa Inziello "Tracy2.0",4,There's always a lot of plot twist which makes it very interesting and the characters are believable. Hope they continue to make these.
B0045TGRSG,MARK J. LONG "Martok",3,Don't like scary stuff my kids probably watched it. They love scary movies. I can live without them. They loved it.
B0045TGRSG,Toby De La Pena,5,I really really like to be scarred and this really sit my on the edge!!!!!  I was thinking I was seeing something out of the corner of my view!!!!!  Amazing and also my son and his girlfriend like to watch this also.  The Haunted Season 2 did not let me down with scaring me!
B0045TGRSG,Wellred_2 "Carol",2,I don't like that Amazon charges me a monthly charge and yet I am not able to watch streamed shows that I expected to be able to watch with the my monthly subscription.
B0045TKIRW,Striving4Excellence,5,This is one of the best shows for teaching how things are made.I ended my Netflix subscription because they canceled the show.Amazon picked it up. NOW YOU HAVE DECIDED TO CHARGE FOR IT.This is not a deal in my house.BRING IT BACK ON PRIME FOR FREE!
B0045TKISQ,combs,5,I find it interesting to hear about paranormal or hauntings. I love to get the chance to see them through different streaming channels.
B0045TKISQ,Janet Lynn,5,I am glad Amazon recommened this show because I never heard of it before. I liked a lot of the cases and found it interesting to watch. I did watch the whole season already!
B0045XL3I6,Amazon Customer "Carolyn",5,I loved this show. The premise was just fabulous. it's a shame the show was cancelled by the network. The DVD's are great to be able to watch when I have nothing to watch and need a cerebral-pick-me-up-show..
B0045XL3I6,Avril Sol,5,Better than season 2.
B0045XL3I6,bob,5,Cal Lightman is an enigma sometimes you love him sometimes you hate him but the character is certainly unique and the way he and Jillian interact is great.  Went thru all 3 seasons in a week and wish there were more.
B0045XL3I6,Day Fan,5,He can worm anything out of anyone if given the chance.  This is another TV series I throughly enjoyed and was cancelled.
B0045XL3I6,D Dawg,3,In this season I feel that the writers and producers were trying to hard and focusing way to much on character development.  Personally I believe that character development should be done in the first season of a show and find it tedious to start learning about the characters in season 3.
B0045XL3I6,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Lie to Me Season 3 is great!  We looked forward to seeing each episode.  The story line is different each time and the cast is outstanding.  We highly recommend as good entertainment.
B0045XL3I6,Kathryn A. Helmke "Kathy",5,Good show with no unnecessary sex.  Wish it was still going!!!  Funny characters and varied story lines with interest. Miss
B0045XL3I6,N. Rude,5,Very sad that this was the last season! Should have gone a season more to finish but it is still worth the watch!! Has you guessing through the
B0045XL3I6,red925,5,I loved all 3 seasons of Lie to Me! I have to say the main character got a little goofier in the 3rd season but still a great show! I felt left down that it ended without real closure. I wanted more!I may be imagining it but I notice I watch peoples facial expressions a little closer since viewing Lie to Me. Maybe there really is something to reading lies!
B0045XL3I6,Terrijean,5,Great premise and clever characterizations. The interactions are superb. Story lines are fresh. Hope this series has a Season 4.
B0045XR7O0,Amazon Customer "&#34;Price Shopper&#34;",5,Here you have a cop that understands how to justify doing the wrong to bring about the right.  He tracks down killers and bends the rules to make sure they no longer victimize people.  He's ethical and unethical at the same time and it's interesting to see to what level of insubordination he'll go to right a situation.  Compelling and thought provoking.  You root for Luther as he is consumed with bringing the criminal to justice.  Same for season 2.
B0045XR7O0,Carmen M Colon,5,Whether you are a lover of psychological thrillers or just gritty action packed ones Luther provides enough for both. The character is the epitome of HUMAN and SUPERHUMAN in the same breath. I've not seen a show in a long time that portrays all the cracks and faults of being a human being and yet show the strength and conviction of a super hero in one person.You love him and hate him at times but you root for him every time. Villains are multi-faceted as well. Season 3 won't arrive fast enough.
B0045XR7O0,Eric Barreto "Eric B.",4,Not bad for a BBC production. The story lines are dark and suspensful and the acting is top notch. I highly recommend this if you're into British television.
B0045XR7O0,Hoosier Grandfather,3,This was okay just got a little intense for us.
B0045XR7O0,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,Enjoyable and the cast interaction is great!  Suspend your imagination and check it out.  Season 2 is just as good.  Can't wait for Season 3 to be stream ready.
B0045XR7O0,kindlelover,5,Strong violent content with spellbinding believalble characters. Luther is such a dedicated detective who challenges  his superiors and leads his team to never give up on finding those that prey on London's population.
B0045XR7O0,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",4,The story lines are good with the various episodes in this series.  I enjoyed watching Season 1 and would recommend it to a viewer that likes British mysteries.
B0045XR7O0,LaurenG,5,I think the best part about watching Luther is that you never know which direction  the show is going to take. Best Show Ever.
B0045XR7O0,Loretta Mederos,5,This is one quality show. I wish people I loved would stop dying here though. Great acting. Story line is very suspenseful and keeps you going. I am almost at the end of one of the seasons that I will have to wait for more. Hope more comes.
B0045XR7O0,M. A. Griffin,4,First saw Idris Elba in a US movie and had no idea he was a Brit.  He is a very good actor and the detective series fit him very well. The supporting cast moves the story right along and keeps you guessing.  Very entertaining TV.  Wish there was a season two.
B0045XR7O0,Martha S. Clark,4,Fast paced.  Good acting and interesting characters.  A little difficult to understand some of what they say.  I'm on episode 4.
B0045XR7O0,phcfamily,4,We enjoy this series because it's different and interesting. The addition of the female murderess as his &#34;helper&#34;  makes it more interesting.
B0045XR7O0,S. Marsh,5,This is a wonderful series. You care about the characters and the stories are great! Would llike to watch all the episodes.
B0045XR7O0,Teresa P.,5,Love this series. Just finished watching the wallender series and was looking for something similar. This is just as good but shorter episodes. Reminds me of law and order but with british accents. Looking forward to second season.
B0045XR7O0,violet rose,5,didn't know much about this series but thought what the heck and boy am I so glad I said what the heck LOL....this is an excellent cop drama....love the luther character.....u cant get away with anything with him around....smart character....love him !!!  the whole show is excellent...great stories...great drama....this is a must see show !!!!!
B0045XR7O0,Whomike "Whomike",4,A Good BBC Police procedure drama. I like it- my wife thinks it is a bit &#34;dark&#34;. But she dislikes &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; also. She thinks that series is way too &#34;dark&#34;.This series is much better than &#34;Wallander&#34;. I like the action in &#34;Luther&#34; and I can understand the characters when they speak. It is not too &#34;English&#34;.I think you will like the series!
B0046B2ODA,bike enthusiast "bike enthusiast",4,I've loved myth busters ever since they started broadcasting. This season is as entertaining and informative as any of the others. Highly recommended.
B0046B2ODA,Diatom,5,This is the kind of show you can watch episode after episode and not get bored. That's what my 12 yo son does (if we let him)!
B0046B2ODA,Ken,5,I love the Mythbusters.  They are always testing and getting into the meat of problems.  Sure some of the stuff they do may not be right if you area an expert in that area but the intentions are good and the show is great!
B0046B2ODA,Lurch,5,Taking things that are said or taught through the years and putting them to the test and making it fun.  A great show for the whole family.  Great way to get your mind working and maybe inspire you to test something yourself.
B0046B2ODA,Some Guy,5,I've always loved this show. I guess a lot of people do or it wouldn't still be running this many years. A welcome relief from the typical TV fare. In a TV world full of 90+ percent garbage this show always amuses me.
B0046B2ODA,Wendy Johnson "Imcyked",5,Mythbusters has been around for years but I never get tired of their enthusiasm for busting/confirming myths. The topics are timely and entertaining with a smidgen of science thrown in.
B0046DLPWY,AER,4,Its short and sweet and you want there to be a happy ending. I prefer quirky over cute and predictable.
B0046DLPWY,BarbaraKButler,5,This program is strange in that I can never tell what the real truth is until the very end of the program  Leaves me with my mouth open every time and I would love to see this series go on.
B0046DLPWY,DAE,5,Wish there was MORE! Love the show! are there any more seasons available? I'd love to see them too!  This was great.
B0046DLPWY,Dan,4,Enjoyable entertaining show with clever ending sequence.  I am surprised it got cancelled considering the quality of things that do.  Dan
B0046DLPWY,Debbie Dillon,4,I like this show but it only lasted one season so no reason to get to invested in it. But it was a fairly good show.
B0046DLPWY,D H Leschot,4,Nice interplay between the leading characters keeps this series worth watching.  Law and order fans might enjoy this series with the addition of the humorous sketches that keep the tension between the female ADA and the male defense attorney moving right along.  I had never heard of these until I saw them on Prime but so glad I did.  If there is second year season available I would definitely watch.
B0046DLPWY,Dr. William Costello "Dr. Bill",5,Think of the best combination of Law & Order and NYPD Blue and this is it.  We are cops/mystery fans and loved it.
B0046DLPWY,E. Lillian Creveling,4,A very enjoyable story about lawyers and their relationship. The competition between them is humorous. I wish there were more like this.
B0046DLPWY,grace,2,excellent acting but do not like such fast moving dialogue and switching back and forth between different scenarios.  looked like excellent story line though.
B0046DLPWY,Jacqueline A. Conney-forero "jaqtwo",4,I enjoyed the show but I guess it didn't have enough viewers because I believe it was cancelled after the 1st season
B0046DLPWY,S. M. Lott "MovieMusic",4,Well acted compelling stories.  To bad this series did not last.
B0046DLPWY,Tullynme,4,I watched this when it first aired- at least a couple of episodes and was disappointed when it was cancelled. Both Rob Marrow & Maura Tierney are very good as opposing attorneys and in roles that are different than other series they have been in.When I watched the first episode both originally and now I found the back and forth-prosecution/defense a bit annoying but after the first episode it didn't seem to be an issue. It is nice that most times the actual guilty or innocence (usually guilty) is revealed. Sometimes surprising others not so much.This reminds me of and is of the same caliber as The Good Wife.
B0046XJEXG,combs,5,Again these are mysteries that are amazing how these cases get solved. I hope these types of shows will continue to be streamed for free through amazon.
B0046XJEXG,Diana Strole,5,I thought the series was great. It's hard for me to imagine that two evil minded people manage to find each other and agree to do the horrible things they do!
B0046XJEXG,Gloria Jean Johnston,1,This is a rehash of the dreadful &#34;reality TV&#34; junk.  Just terrible.  Why any published author would participate in such a venture is difficult to conjure.
B0046XJEXG,kathryn,3,I would much rather read or watch fictional mysteries because I find true crime a sordid occupation after a while.  But I liked how the authors explained how their writing was inspired by the true story.
B0046XJEXG,Lois J. Waldron "web devotee",5,I enjoyed hearing the authors explain how they developed their stories. I really enjoyed their insight. Looking forward to more.
B0046XJEXG,Sinohey "scribe",3,Interesting concept of having mystery/thriller writers introduce and narrate episodes of true crimes.I found the editing for streaming to be subpar due to the repetitive interruptions (for placement of ads in the original TV series); it should have been seamless without breaks.
B0047C8BGW,Another opinion,5,Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining.  The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass.  But Season 1 is the very best of all seasons.
B0047C8BGW,Mary paushel,5,So much fun just watching all over again where it all started.  How much Camille has changed from the first season till now.
B0047C8BGW,Pet Wisdom,4,This was one of my favorite episodes. It was nice to actually see people who were actually wealthy. Some of the other housewife  shows have people on there pretending to be rich. This episode actually had people that were actually millionaires on it.
B0047C8BGW,Valerie Tucker,5,This is a good series and it is interesting to go back and watch the beginning now that I know so many things have changed.  My daughter wanted to order it and I watched it with her.  I noticed many things that I missed the first time.  Interesting!
B0047G01H0,Altecian,4,Love love love this show it will shock and amaze you as you meet yet more historical figures with some &#34;unique&#34; backgrounds you would not have learned about in school and some ld friends from the previous seasons return.
B0047G01H0,DIANNA,5,THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SHOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE SCI FI SHOWS. IT HAS SUSPENCE AND MONSTERS IN IT. THE ACTING AND STORY LINE IS GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR A LOW BUDGET SHOW LIKE THIS ONE. TOO BAD IT GOT CANCEL IT ONLY HAS 4 SEASONS
B0047G01H0,Pulpman,4,I have been marathoning all of this show and I have to admit it holds my interest and I look forward to getting to the next episode. Lots happen and the show moves at a good pace. The characters are still developing and they have a new villan and time is catching up with past sins. Well done intricate plotting.Robin Dunne is showing some real acting chops this season. Have to admit this show holds my attention all the way through.
B0047G01H0,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,I am an avid fan of this series.  Storylines are very original and I appreciate the character development of the series stars.  Story revolves around the dedicated people looking to preserve the 'abnormals' living within human societies around the world.  Each weekly episode revolves around a different creature the group attempts to rescue.  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good SiFi story.
B0047G01H0,ROY,5,This is again one of those shows you will want to see each week and more.. The third season was great and added more action stories...
B0047G01H0,setzco,4,This season is in keeping with the show so far definately worth adding to your collection I give it two thumbs up.
B0047L75W4,Beverly Morten,5,I collect all of Project Run Way DVD's I am a fashion Major and they help me in my classes
B0047YXQ10,Kandy Langford,5,A fanciful film - made me I wish I was 20ish/over- educated & could live on whatever I made.  If it were the late '60s...you could survive on very/very little.  Is working in a parking lot any worse then at &#34;Ryder's Pet & Patio&#34;?  I think not.  All the guys were interesting/smart & could laugh at themselves.  Being able to laugh at yourself will get you thru life...
B0047YZISE,Debra Cook,5,This show has a little more of a scientific approach to ghostly investigations.  I would recommend this show to everyone.
B0047YZISE,Leo Hott,5,I enjoyed there approach to the study of the paranormal. I feel that shows like this are very entertaining & are fun to watch.
B0047YZISE,SteelJan,4,I love a good Ghost Hunting show and the Klinge brothers know how to bring it.  Lots of excitement here.
B0047YZISE,Teresa Pietersen,5,This team are led by the two Kling brothers who are entertaining while still using science based theories for the paranormal.Excellent viewing for anyone interested in ghost investigations. Some thinking outside the box and interesting locations.
B0048ZXXIO,Amazon Customer,5,My daughter absolutely loves this show. 2 years old and probably the show she asks for the most. If your child likes Dora and Bubble guppies they may like this one two
B0048ZXXIO,Belizelovely,5,I love Team Umizoomi as much as my 3 year old. We have watched season 1 over and over again and the other seasons you have to pay for. Well they finally gave us a break and made Team Umizoomi Season 2 available for Prime to view for free. We are definitely enjoying continuing to see what the team has been up to.
B0048ZXXIO,beth and chris,4,no really we can't get enough i wish more seasons were available for instant. we just keep re-watching the same season
B0048ZXXIO,B. J. Mitchell,5,This is a new one for the grand kids and it seems to take a little more interaction.  They like this one though the music is not as stimulating for them.
B0048ZXXIO,bobbi,4,This was great entertainment for my young grandson. This 2nd season was very good. I recommend it for young children. I may not be as entertaining for older children. My grandson is 2 and a half. I hope this helps. Very cute program.
B0048ZXXIO,Charlene Perdue,5,Love this show and it is very educational.  My grandson has learned a lot from watching.  Thanks and continue the success
B0048ZXXIO,Christine Vogelsang,5,Great show that teaches early math concepts in a fun way.  Great to see girls in the show being experts in math.
B0048ZXXIO,Debbifaye,5,My little on loves Team Umizoomis.  We watch the videos together and she learns numbers and shapes and memorizes the song.
B0048ZXXIO,EBeeH,4,I like that TU addresses early math skills in each episode and the animation is cute and colorful. I also enjoy that the show incorporates real child actors in the vein of Blue's Clues. My five year old and two year old really enjoy watching the show.
B0048ZXXIO,Gigi123,5,My son loves this between this and bubble guppies he can't get enough and is actually learning from watching the different shoes.  Hope the other seasons are offered as prime soon!
B0048ZXXIO,Jennifer DeBoin,5,Very cute show for kids. I have twin 2yr olds and a 5 year old and they all love it.
B0048ZXXIO,Jon O "Health Care Worker",4,Great Learning Experience For My 2 Year Old. Loaded With Math Content And A Fun Learning Environment. Highly Recommend it.
B0048ZXXIO,Judith Church,5,My grandson is a budding math genius. I have had to revise how we learn things mathematical and loves doing math with the team.
B0048ZXXIO,Kirk,4,My 4 year old loves watching the show. He said he would give it 4 out 5 stars. Glad amazon has it in the library.
B0048ZXXIO,Lisa M Wiley,5,My girls love Team Umizoomi!  Every episode has something for them to learn that involves math and patterns.  Cute and educational.
B0048ZXXIO,M.G.,5,My granddaughter adores this show. The characters are so cute and colorful. That Umizoomi team has saved us several times when we needed a distraction.  It's a hit!
B0048ZXXIO,Michael Hayes,5,This is one of my sons favorite shows along with Bubble Guppies.It teaches him while he watches and doesn't realize it.Great show for kids
B0048ZXXIO,mom12,3,I don't like umizoomi but the kids like it. I don't think its creative and the songs are corny and the tasks take forever to complete. I like the idea of being task oriented but they take so long to go through each step that it feels as if they are trying to force learning.
B0048ZXXIO,Rebecca Lee,5,What can I say? My 4 year old grandson likes it.  It must be good.
B0048ZXXIO,r. laver,5,my sister watches this all day long ever tho i don't remember buying this my sister loves it and i think i know who bought it my silly sister.thank you
B0048ZXXIO,Stephen C. Rankin,4,My sons favorite show perhaps and hen likes counting along with it and solving the problems out loud. Great for a 2 year old.
B0049AFWKK,Cynthia Robutka,5,like seeing boss doing the actual work and finding they cant do it so the series is good. cut the cable and never watched the show before but it is something different.
B0049AFWKK,Lurch,4,The show has some great parts but is very easy to see that it is all set up before hand.  Will keep you entertained but not well produced.  Many other shows out there are much better.
B0049AFWKK,M. Grant "minimum wage extravagance",5,the story arcs are very touching but i really do hope the 'changes' last longer than a 1 year review on camera
B0049AFWKK,Steven Roach,5,if the ceos are held to their word and keep the changes they have made to make their companies more friendly and profitable the yes i would suggest watching this show.
B0049QKX6W,bruce,5,It's amazing how much these people go through to try to get away with it. If they put half their minds to a lawful existance they would be much better off
B0049QKX6W,Camilla Stradley,5,If you like COPS or any of the other criminal shows you will love this.  You get to see the criminal and hear their stories of how they eluded the police for so long.  On the run but the good guys win.
B0049QKX6W,movieluvr,4,I can just pick any ID show and get sucked right in. With this particular show I find myself most times rooting for the guy to get away - although not for the crazy murderers.
B004AJ1CKE,Bryan,5,Classic nicktoon I almost forgot about. Now my son is a fan. He loves the classic shows like catdog and angry beavers
B004AJ1CKE,Pamala Pickard,5,I like the detail  in the artwork. I wish I could converse with animals. I liked that they moved around the world. It is for everyone.
B004AJ36NA,Belizelovely,5,This is the cutest show. Too bad they only made about 4-5 episodes. I like all the characters and my son is really enjoying it as well.
B004AJ36NA,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,Both my grandsons love this show.  They watch it one our Kindles and my iPad.  The streaming is perfect so the picture and sound quality is great.
B004AJ36NA,Rebecca Snell "boulder50",5,My grandson loves the Blues Clue song and Joe is in these episodes singing along  so he loves it even more
B004AJ36NA,Toran Dax,2,I often have to watch what my child is watching and usually its entertaining but this was like torture.  It was so boring I was very glad it stopped after 4 episodes.
B004ATLR9K,C. G. Porcaro "drivec",5,The staple of the b-rate sci-fi horror film? Spiders. Giant Radioactive Spiders. The MST3K crew riffs this one quite well.
B004ATLR9K,JohnS,4,A truly bad movie in the finest tradition of MST 3K.  My only disappointment was that Mike & Co. didn't add more comments during the movie
B004ATLR9K,Louis Diana,4,Not one of Michael J. Nelson's best but a very funny episode indeed. The Observer/Pearl story line was weak. Crow is awesome as always
B004AUIJ04,New2This,5,Excellent recap of the development of weapons and applications and howmany modern products were affected by use during warfare.
B004AUIJ04,pd,5,What a great overview of the weapons and people in war history.  This is best I have seen in some time. Explains the evolution of each subject clearly and graphically. Well Done!
B004AZ5QG4,cindyszy,1,This was more of a comical depiction than a more serious show regarding the people that were portrayed in it.  I really don't have any more to say about this as I was disappointed with the series.
B004AZ5QG4,Geneva,5,i live in a haunted house and these stories are very similar to what I experience on a daily basis.
B004AZ5QG4,Jimmy Don Johnson,4,The stories seemed real and kept me interested.  There are so many ghost stories that it is hard to find good ones.  These were very good.  I would watch another season.
B004AZ5QG4,JLH4,3,It's an okay show to enjoy the stories of other persons that may have experienced what they have experienced at that time
B004AZ5QG4,Journey "Journey",5,I expected not to like this (not sure why) but I am hooked. The one nice thing about this series vs other programs like this....it has multiple stories in each episode. So I know if I only have about 15 minutes or so of &#34;free time&#34; I can squeeze in at least one story before I have to head out. The stories are good & believable. I also highly recommend &#34;A Haunting&#34; & &#34;The Haunted&#34;
B004AZ5QG4,K. Hopkins "K Hopkins",4,It was interesting; fairly typical of this type of show but enjoyable.  I liked that the story was told by the people involved.
B004AZ5QG4,Mary Jaeger "Mary",5,I love watching stories of the paranormal!
B004AZ5QG4,Nicole McDowell,5,I love paranormal shows.  This is one of the better ones.  Hope they add more seasons to Amazon prime soon.
B004AZ5QG4,readinglarge,5,This is all ghost stories backed up by some wild no holds barred evidence by regular people like you and me.you will love it if not you can tell me all about it but I am not worried because it's great.
B004AZ5QG4,Tech Ed "Tech Ed",3,To this point I have viewed all but one of the first session's episodes and I cannot say that I find the evidence convincing. That may not be the goal of the program; perhaps it is intended to entertain or stir up frisson in its viewers. No differences from ghost sightings from the 20th century except now we have digital cameras and video and audio recorders. Most sightings happen in poor lighting and on camera or video only--no one sees them at the time the photo is taken or the recording is made. Any speech attributed to the ghosts is garbled and at the level of the background noise. Growing up with Casper has spoiled it for me: he was visible (when he wanted to be) and transparent and spoke clearly (and sometimes softly).
B004AZ5QG4,The Working Dead,4,I really like this series. Full of eyewitness interviews and reenactments that create an enjoyable show. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.
B004AZ5QG4,Z. J. Garcia "snozwanger",4,I am a fan. The show is fairly compelling and holds my interest. It seems to be more truth than the other ghost &#34;hunting&#34; shows that some networks put on.
B004B8O9GI,Bryan,5,At first my son did not want to watch it but once it started playing and showing kids all the fun games they could do outside without toys he got into it. Now he wants to go outside and play here we go looped de loop. Also it does a very good job at showing kids about Africa's culture.
B004B8O9GI,gregory,5,we watched this show when it was first aired on nickelodeon.  We loved it then and still just as much now
B004B8O9GI,HannahLynn,5,I used to watch this as a kid! I was so excited when I found it on prime for my daughter! It's so unique and has great music!!
B004B8O9GI,Rebecca Snell "boulder50",5,Gullah has familiar songs kids sing in school.  The mother father figure are very personable. The mother and father interact with the kids in song and dance
B004B8O9GI,Ty's Tiny Tip,5,Gullah Gullah Island was one of my faves as a kid. I always sing the songs to my daughter and had mentioned to a friend that they don't make quality children's TV anymore and that I wish they had Gullah Gullah Island around still. Then one day I was browsing children's show on my Prime acct and saw it. I played an episode for my daughter and she's been hooked since.
B004BGQA8A,Becky,5,I love to watch this show with my mom. It is so funny.  I feel like they ab live a lot on the show.
B004BGQA8A,B. J. Mitchell,5,I watched it years ago and it was delightful to watch and enjoy the first season of this all over again.
B004BGQA8A,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",5,All time best comedy series I've ever seen. I enjoy watching it over & over. All the acting is good & Judy is just the best. The writing is super. Definitely a classic.
B004BGQA8A,DebB,5,I'm so glad Amazon included this with Prime. I use to watch it years ago on APT and now enjoy it even more since I'm a bit older!
B004BGQA8A,Ellyn M. Renken,3,I only watched 1-1/2 episodes of this show.  I did not find it interesting or entertaining.  I don't recommend it.
B004BGQA8A,Jacqueline Garrett "jackie g",5,This show never disappoints I watch it over and over and will continue to do so down to the years
B004BGQA8A,Jane Ford,5,This whole series is a favorite of mine. I love it and watch episodes over and over - and I wish the anniversary episodes would be shown on Prime.
B004BGQA8A,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",5,I love this show.  It's a great program to watch if you want to relax and unwind.  Too bad there are not more shows like this these days.
B004BGQA8A,Mrs. W,5,Love the dry humor!  Judi Dench is fantastic!  Saw later episodes on tv a few years ago.  Now I understand how it all evolved!
B004BGQA8A,Rebecca McCord,5,This is really a good series & we are very much enjoying it. We plan to watch all of them and catch up!
B004BGQA8A,Robert J. Maceri "mongoose41",4,This British program is very enjoyable.  The actors do their job very well.  British humor is always fun for me.
B004BGQA8A,shirley,5,I have been watching As Time Goes By for many years. I never tire of watching them. It is English humor and sitcom but entertaining .  The characters all have a special part in the episodes. I love Judy Dench in anything she does. It is a favorite of mine.
B004BGS3C6,Alice Dee,4,With homage to Woody Allen for defining a &#34;dead shark relationship.&#34;  Judy and Alistair have a &#34;dead shark relationship.&#34;  They could use some help from &#34;Le Fea Mas Bella.&#34;
B004BGS3C6,Amazon Customer,5,Love this series.  It is very humorous and stories stay true to the delightful and sometimes quarky characters.  Its a timeless series for adults of any age.
B004BGS3C6,barbibobu,4,This pleasant british sitcom is enjoyable for seeing the actors (particularly the veteran leads) trade quips. The witty repartee is funny and the show takes its time letting the situation develop modestly.
B004BGS3C6,BestDayofMyLife "Great Shopper",5,Sometimes it's just lovely to sit and watch something lighthearted you don't have to think about. Just sit and enjoy. :)
B004BGS3C6,Donna M. Dluehosh,5,I just stumbled on this series and since Judi Dench was in it I knew it had to be good.  I have really enjoyed it for the most part. Looking forward to catching the other seasons.
B004BGS3C6,Guy Portland Oregon "Guy Portland Oregon",4,the credits with the song are just great have to pull up jimmy durante singing it oftem on the web. Lionel is such a stodgy pickle you just want to swat him some
B004BGS3C6,Jane Ford,5,I love this series - season 2 as with all the seasons is so heartfelt and a feel-good story all the way around. So real.
B004BGS3C6,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",5,I love watching this show when I need to unwind after a long day.  The characters are very endearing.  I can watch it over and over.
B004BGS3C6,Nelda Woolverton,4,Recommend this series to anyone who enjoys British comedy. Judy Dench is so witty and droll. Keeps me laughing throughout every episode.
B004BGS3C6,rmb7500,4,I remember watching some episodes of this show on PBS some years ago and liked it then.  I only saw a small percentage of the total.  When I found it on Amazon Prime I started watching it from the beginning and have gotten hooked on it this time.  It helps seeing the episodes from the beginning.  You get a better understanding of the relationship.  It is well worth watching.
B004BGS3C6,Robert J. Maceri "mongoose41",5,If you like offbeat British humor this is a good program for you.  This program is believeable and down to earth.
B004BGS3C6,Sophie,5,This show is great.  All the players are funny and  great actors.  Wish there were more shows off this quality!
B004BGS3C6,William Clem,5,My wife and I have spent hours watching. The chemistry is great between all the characters especially Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench.
B004BHEC8O,Aud,5,I love the characters and watching them develop throughout the series. I never laughed so much! Loved this series! Highly recommend!
B004BHEC8O,Jane Ford,5,This is my favorite series and I wish they had continued to make more - and I wish you were offering the reunion specials on streaming - how about it? Thanks!
B004BHEC8O,Kathy,5,wonderful to be able to rewatch this great series season by season and see the characters change.  Thanks so much
B004BHEC8O,Kim,5,For anyone with grown kids you will see the humor in this show.  I enjoy watching poor Lionel having to deal with three women in one house.  Lionel does not have it in his nature to discuss certain topics and the women in the house sometimes enjoy putting him on the spot.  This show can be humorous.  Enjoy it.  I plan on watching it all again.
B004BHEC8O,Sylvia Evans,5,I love the series - love the story line - love the actors - love this type of humor.  Probably I am such a fan because I am 70 years old and can relate to it very well
B004BHGDYK,Amazon Customer "EAJ",5,It's so well written and so droll. Extra stars for Judi Dench!  It's nice to see something aimed at people older than 20 something.
B004BHGDYK,B. J. Mitchell,5,I have watched all of the seasons of this series that I can find and love them all.  Dame Judi Dench  is always wonderful.
B004BHGDYK,Jane Ford,5,I love the premise of As Time Goes By - so warm and fuzzy and comfortable even when Aunt Penny is in the episode.
B004BHGDYK,John P. Bradford "Angelophile",5,&#34;As time goes By has been a long running series on PBS here in the States.  Seen often on Saturday nights it never has grown old or tiresome.  Lionel and Jean have met after being separated while he was in Korea during the war.  A lost letter has resulted in their having lost much time.  Reunited they live a good life together in London.  Not the atypical situation comedy is low key but still funny.
B004BHGDYK,Love Amazon,5,I love British television and this to me is as good as it gets. There is never a bad episode. The characters are so realistic I feel like I know them. They don't come any better than Judi Dench.
B004BHGDYK,Queenwilliams,5,Always humerous and all age groups can enjoy this show. It's no wonder it was so popular for so long.
B004BHISOI,Aud,5,This season was way too short. Only 4 episodes! I couldn't believe it! Loved the happy ending for all. My sister called to say how sad she was also to see it end. Loved this show!
B004BHISOI,Becky,5,Awesome series. My 84 year old mom and I watch it together.
B004BHISOI,B. J. Mitchell,5,I have watched all the seasons of this series and I love the writing as well as the crew. I hope this wasn't the last i will see of them.
B004BHISOI,MaxJ,5,I have watched this series for years on PBS and never tire of it.  To have access to it any time I like is  just iceing on the cake.
B004BHISOI,MtnMysteryReader,5,Always a sweet story with lots of English humor.  Has been a fav for many years.  And the girls finally got married.
B004BHISOI,Paja,5,Really like this show it is so nice to get the seasons that I missed earlier.  Thank you Amazon
B004BN7CGW,I. Tauber,5,I love this science show.  They have a variety of topics in each show and explain them in a easy to understand and entertaining way.  This is my go-to show for evening relaxation.
B004BN7CGW,L. Hossler "LSH",4,My children and I like watching this together.  We all are into science at some level.  My wish is that they be more diverse in adding more opinions than just the standard evolutionary development that most science shows are going with currently.  They should be more opened minded to include all audience members possible view points.
B004BN7CGW,Maynez,5,This shows is full of good scientific information. They come with a formula that make complex topics easy to understand. They present all kind of topics in the show from animal intelligence to the universe. I highly recommend the show.
B004BN7CGW,Melanie,5,It was interesting but the delivery is definitely geared toward a young (10 - 16) audience.  A great show to get young people more involved in science.
B004BTR8JW,Kim,5,I can so relate to the show.  As a parent I so enjoy watching this show.  Its just another enjoyable show from BBC.
B004BTR8JW,Lisa Ilie Dodwell "lisad1",5,Very entertaining with everyday humor we can all relate to. The actors are fantastic and very much in character. Sad to see it end.
B004BTR8JW,Nelda Woolverton,5,I give season five five stars because it is my favorite British comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who likes British comedy.
B004BTR8JW,Tanesha L. Barkley,5,A beautiful love story that begin years ago yet as many couples do sometimes go their separate ways. After time both marriages ended Lionel and Jean has reunited after many years.  This heart warming comedy will bring you much enjoyment and look at people after so much time has past somehow find they way back into each others hearts.
B004CAGDQO,phcfamily,3,The support characters add more to the story than the &#34;star&#34;. I don't recommend because the episodes are too similar.
B004CD4J44,Kindle Customer,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE The Vicar of Dibley!!! Will watch this show over and over epsecially when im in need to a good laugh..amazing show
B004CD4J44,LR,5,This show is full of great British humor with an excellent cast and exception writers. I return to this series often and the humor never subsides.  Don't turn it off while the credits are running because it isn't over.  There is one list bit you need to see at the very end.  I wish this show could have gone on for many more seasons.
B004CTBG1W,Amazon Customer,5,My Daughter loves Caillou. It's one of the few programs I let her watch. When the weather turns nice we'll spend as much time as possible outside but till then this is a winner for young children.
B004CTBG1W,Christa Douglas,5,My 3 yr olds love this show. Caillou is cute he is always interested in learning and trying out new ideas. The shows are always teaching your children an important lesson or valuable moral all while being entertained!
B004CTBG1W,Jacqueline S Mihalik,5,This is a cute show that has lots of good lessons for kids. Very educational for the younger 4/5 year olds.
B004CTBG1W,Jane,5,Normally I avoid having the television on in the background when my grandchild is here but anything with Caillou and his family is welcome!
B004CTBG1W,Jo Ann Winternheimer,5,5 year old granddaughter loves it on TV.  How great to be able to let her watch it on a portable device...my Kindle Fire.
B004CTBG1W,K. A. Morgan "book relisher",5,My grand niece loves this show.  She says she likes when he learns stuff.  I like that he loves his adventures in the world.  And I love that he is not afraid to try new things.
B004CTBG1W,Kindle Customer,5,I like for  my grandson to watch Cailou because there is parent interaction with the child.  So many of these children shows have and understood parent influence but you never see the parent.
B004CTBG1W,Kristin L. Weiner,5,All my kids love Caillou. He's educational and fun. Something my 7 and 3 year old can agree to watch together.
B004CTBG1W,Manismi,5,my kids loved it
B004CTBG1W,Mark and Lindsay,5,My kids love this program. They like the way Caillou interacts with his little sister and love to watch his adventures. They can't get enough!
B004CTBG1W,mongiesgirl,5,My grandson is almost 2 and he loves Caillou. I was a little concerned at 1st because Caillou seems to be somewhat Whiny  and I didn't want him to copy him but there are lots of lessons to learn and that makes up for it. There are only a few shows where there is a lot of whining and I just avoid those.
B004CTBG1W,surgidude,5,my great grandson absolutely loved it. the quality of the picture and audio is terrific.  I was truly impressed with it.
B004CTBG1W,Susan D'Alessandro,5,What's not to like about Caillou?  It really holds the kids attention and they can idenity with his &#34;issues&#34; & I think they intently watch how he solves the same thing they feel.
B004CTUECE,alicia myers,5,their GREAT such different lives. Its unimaginable living WITH alligators!! keeps me glued every time I watch them.WISH they will have swamp people 4 on prime free crossing my fingers!!!!
B004CTUECE,chai,5,The whole family loves watching this series. Looking forward to watching the next season. We didn't know what it took to catch them gaters.
B004CTUECE,E. Yeager,5,This is an interesting way of living! So different from most people. But so honest and real. An enjoyable way to earn history. This is real reality tv.
B004CTUECE,Judith Pritchard,4,You really don't want to like the people however you cant help root for them as they go after huge gators.
B004CTUP28,Gizmo "ctwin60",4,If you like true crime then this is the show for you. These are real cases where the detectives don't always solve the crime in a day or ever. Shows you how little life is valued by some.
B004CTUP28,Jacob Crampton,5,I have always enjoyed this show. Real life murder investigations tha you get to tag along on and watch as the detectives solve them.
B004CTUP28,Jeni,5,the First 48 shows you that crimes aren't solved like that in CSI. I love how real the show is - you follow the detectives on each case from start to finish. It's dramatic and emotional. I wish they would offer all of the seasons on Prime. do not watch if you have a weak stomach!
B004CTUP28,Penelope Penworthy,5,I've been a fan of police/crime dramas for over 50 years.  First 48 is as close as you can get to actually riding along in person with police detectives from many cities in the country.
B004CTUP28,Richee,5,It's amazing how these scumbags tell on themselves and their &#34;so called friends&#34; !! Wow !! It's great to see these Idiots get put away for LIFE !!!!!!!
B004D0733A,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,They are not afraid to do a program that is controversial either.  There are few programs I can compare NOVA because it is a standard of excellence that I associate with NOVA.  I have to laugh when I hear about funding cuts to public broadcasting. NOVA is proof of how programming like this is some of the best way to spend education dollars. If you do not like or agree with an episode in this format skip to a different one that is why on demand works
B004D0733A,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,this is simply a quality production and very interesting subject matter.PBS does it again. I can't wait for what is next.Dr George Tomes
B004D0733A,Larry Parker,5,I've never watched a Nova I didn't enjoy. The best Science program around. I'll be watching Nova again cause it does not get old.
B004D0733A,loveinthemist,5,nova presents learning new things in an interesting media presentation. With nice visualas well as great speakers etc.Just is interesting to watch and learn.The topics are so varied and wide that makes everyone happy.
B004D0733A,Ruth C. Bullock,5,The subjects are unusual and the content is outstanding.  I enjoy every minute of each episode.  I have a PhD and still love to learn.  I have also enrolled my college daughter as many of the subjects are relevant to her academic assignments.
B004D1VQU0,Amber R Burkhart,5,My 5 month old loves this tv show. So do I. It's extremely educational. It's one of her favorite shows to watch.
B004D1VQU0,Chrystal,5,This is a favorite show of my 3 yr old. It is amazing to me how he has learned so much from this show. He pretends that he is on t he Dinosaur Train all the time.
B004D1VQU0,E B Fricks,5,I love the theme song and sing it with my son. Dinosaur Train is a pleasant little show about dinosaurs that visit previous and future periods of time when various different types of dinosaurs roamed or even swam on the earth. It got Trains and Dinosaurs how can it fail to please!!!!!
B004D1VQU0,PDJ,5,This is such a cute show for kids that love trains and dinosaurs - genius! My son loves this show
B004D1VQU0,surgidude,5,The grandson absolutely loves this video.  We play it quite often and never tire of it. It is well done and the quality is exceptional
B004D1VQU0,thomas marcelain,5,I never heard of this  show till i was going throw kids shows on xbox 360 with the amazon app and now me and boys watch it all the time.
B004D24SZ4,George Herman "More or less retired",3,As one who knew some Yakusa in Hawaii. This is the code they live by. It is not a film for the squeamish.
B004D8JQ4Q,C. G. Porcaro "drivec",5,There are some pretty dark elements to this film that make perfect riffing material. B-rate horror at its finest makes for some good jokes.
B004D8JQ4Q,gator,4,A freaky movie that's perfect for the Mystery Science cast to poke fun at. I never get tirted of their commentary.
B004D8JQ4Q,JohnS,5,This is one of those great MST3K shows where the movie is so bad and the commentary is so ripe that it all meshes together to produce the perfect storm.I always have this inner conflict going between the Joel Hodgson shows and the Mike Nelson shows.  But this one is a classic in either category.
B004DMOJLW,camdonella,5,I'm not sure exactly why but I have always really liked this show for my kids.  It is calm and doesn't have any annoying songs.  The characters are funny if a but odd.  And my kids have always really liked it too.  And the voice of Oswald is Fred Savage!  That was what first drew me to the show.
B004DMOJLW,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",4,The stories are all positive and the friends all help each other get through life. My son loves it and I can bear it.
B004DMOJLW,Daizy72,5,This is such a nice mellow show. There are fun lessons to be learned as the characters solve small every day problems and questions.
B004DMOJLW,ddrevia,5,I love to watch Oswald especially when I'm trying to calm a rowdy bunch. Call able lessons are learned in a peaceful way and I love how the Grands look both ways and say bleep at each head turn like they do on the show.
B004DMOJLW,EBeeH,4,My 5 year old and 2 year old love this series. The pace is a little slow but that's appropriate for the age group this show is made for.
B004DMOJLW,Joe   L. "Joe L.",3,Keeps my one year old entertained but not much more. There could be a little more education to the show.
B004DMOJLW,K. Turner,4,My daughter loves Oswald and keeps returning to it. It's a nice slow-paced cartoon that is visually appealing. Oswald is kind and interacts with all other characters with a level of respect that is refreshing. This was not originally one of my favorites but it has grown on me.
B004DMOJLW,Louis Diana,5,I like Oswald. Both my 7 year old and my 1 year old enjoy the music and the friendly characters. 10 out of 10.
B004DMOJLW,Melanie C Wiitanen,4,I haven't watched this show with my kids. But they both love it (boy 7 and girl 5). It's cute and colorful.
B004DMOJLW,Rubydoo67,5,Simple and entertaining. New love for the octopus. My dd has &#34;learned&#34; a new love for the sea. Recommend it
B004DMOJLW,SavvyShopper,5,Our four pre-schoolers and we love Oswald!  It's a calming show with no violence that really holds their attention. I'm so glad we found it among the other great kids shows on Amazon Instant Video.
B004DMOJLW,Venna,5,My son loves this show and it is so awesome to have it at my fingertips. The download is clean and starts right up.
B004E2BY8W,Amazon Customer,5,Its an enjoyable BBC tv series showing Tom andBarbara Good learning to be self-sufficent in the middle of an urban city.  Very funny with an excellent cast.
B004EKF0QQ,Amazon Customer,3,Worth one watch and that is about it.  It is has a few good moments but not much more.  could have been a good flick.
B004EKF0QQ,Li,5,This was super cute with n unexpected twist.  This is not a typical chick flick.  My husband actually like it.  From what I remember it was pretty sweet and clean.
B004EKF0QQ,SuperDad "SuperDad",3,I enjoyed the twist at the end.  Almost lost interest until that but it recovered a bit.  Alyssa Milano is always enjoyable to watch but I'm surprised she doesn't do better movies.
B004F87GI2,926 Daytripper "926daytripper",5,Brad Meltzers Decoded Season 1 is very nicely done.  All of the episodes are well researched. They give you plenty of things to think about.
B004F87GI2,BrendaMarie,4,I love this show and these personalities that make their way through &#34;history&#34;.  They seek to uncover truth and get justice in knowing the truth.  It shows what people can bring to this need and it shows how far they will go or where they will draw their lines.  It is full of energy and acknowledgement of human frailties and courageous strength of mind and character.
B004F87GI2,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,You think you know what they have in Fort Knox? Do you think congress of the President knows for sure? Would you be surprised to find out that the builder and designer of the faces on Mount Rushmore  had a political agenda that many Americas would not embrace? There is part of the White House that is missing and no one knows where it is. Not even the president? Secret and mystery out in plain site..
B004F87GI2,mbyers,5,Interesting information that the whole family can watch. They research information about different topics leaving (most of the time) to your own conclusion.
B004F87GI2,Nancy Johnson,4,I like this series because of the historical information provided.  The subject matter is very interesting and fun to follow along as they track down the various &#34;mysteries&#34;.
B004F87GI2,Powerhouse,4,I really enjoy this series. I hope I can catch up on the episodes soon. I have liked every episode I have seen thus far.
B004FEJCKQ,Debra Cook,4,It's neat to watch things change from old to new again and what it takes to refurbish so many different things.
B004FEJCKQ,Jannieknows "Jannie",5,I love this show. Then I wonder...how is it that at so many of these auctions there are so many people at the beginning and then it ends up being a showdown between the four silly stars.  Where did all the other people go?  I like treasure hunting...so I get excited when any one gets a great find in a locker.  This is a rough business....I can only imagine.  The best thing about watching this was not have have to wait SO LONG between commercials.  Loved it.  I am on to Season Two very soon.
B004FEJCKQ,jose viveros,3,Liked the show but was expecting a little more.hope next season has more to offer.Will give it one more try.
B004FEJCKQ,Ms. Ruth Levinton,1,Not much to say except this is proof of the dumbing down of our country.  I didn't finish the program.
B004FEJCKQ,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",4,I DO NOT HAVE CABLE TV IN MY HOUSE &  HAVE WATCHED THIS AT A FRIENDS HOUSE ....BUT IM TOO CHEAP TO SPRING 4  CABLE WHEN TV IS FREE....SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED ON MY KINDLE FIRE ON AMAZON PRIME FREE APP... I JUMPED AT  IT....LOVE THIS & THERE ARE NO ADVERSTISEMENTS.......LOVE IT
B004FEJCKQ,RustyShoemaker,5,I love storage wars but I've already watched them all. Just wish I had more seasons to watch although I watch every season more than once they do get old.
B004FEJCKQ,S. S. "Super",4,And pretty funny. Real people are hard to imitate.  Funny idea for a show but I am on thesecond season now.
B004FEJCKQ,Todd Becker,5,My favorite is Barry. I wish this guy was my neighbor. I would be asking him if I could borrow one of his cars to run to the store all the time ... lol
B004FEJCKQ,Veronica V.,5,I enjoy watching this show and watching how the 'pros' do it. The features are also fun to go through.
B004FEJCKQ,Victor1896 "movie addict",5,I'm hooked on this show.  What a bunch of characters.  Very interesting line of work for these people.  I really enjoy it when they take things checked out.
B004FK9CTQ,Adam,5,I recently watched this with my wife who had started watching gold rush on season 2.  I had originally skipped it thinking it would be boring watching it again.  Boy was I wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and seeing how the different miners of season 2 and beyond joined the crew.  It was great seeing Parker as a young quiet kid.  Totally worth the rewatch.
B004FK9CTQ,debby,5,actually liked this alot got me and my husband going if U have adventure in UR Blood then watch this NO GUTS NO GLORY  yea!!!
B004FK9CTQ,D. Owen,4,I only started watching Gold Rush this season - the Hoffmans in Guyana.  I didn't even know who the Hoffmans and their crew were.  They are an interesting group of men.  Now some of their antics make sense after looking at Season 1.
B004FK9CTQ,Eloise Sites,5,I gave the first season of Gold Rush Alaska Season l 5 stars. I believe they spent too much time fixing cabins etc.instead of mining. Everyone seemed to be doing their own thing. There was no organization and no leadership. Despite all of this I found the show to be very interesting and I keep coming back for more.
B004FTMNN4,Ron Baker,3,Well done documentary on a serial child killer and card carrying creepy dude. Andre Rand is manipulative with the filmmakers and shows glimpses of his dark disturbed side. Being from the west coast I never heard of these crimes but they were quite infamous.
B004G7CRUY,Consumer 45,5,History Channel offerings always held my attention. Never found any of them boring. It might be light on some subjects but I enjoy the way it makes my young niece and nephews to ask pertinent questions or inspired them to look up certain subjects the series has bought to their attention.Will certainly watch should time permit.
B004G7CRUY,Cyn,5,It's nice to be able to load these on my kindle and enjoy the series from push back to deboard.
B004G7CRUY,Paul Aguirre,5,Good shows I liked this one good UFO special I would recommend it I love the History channel lots of good stuff here
B004G7CRUY,Teresa Pietersen,4,Fascinating look at several well known magic tricks that practitioners have kept secret.Takes an indepth look at famous magicians and their most notorious performances.Anyone interested in magic shows and magicians will thoroughly enjoy this show.
B004G7CRUY,Terry Draper,2,It's been a while since I viewed the program but it is deceptive in that a family was supposed to have found these documents in an attic and there is no info on what they thought or who they gave the docs to except for a very short mention somewhere in the program. I think the story was with this family; did they lose any family members to the death camps?  A repeat of what went on in the death camps is really getting to be old stuff.  The story needs to be redefined so the young generation of people we have now on the planet know what really happened.
B004GEYL9M,Alex Ross,3,It was nice to see some new content & i did enjoy  watching it.But it was not a fun as last year x-mass story. but still workth watching.Not appropiate for little kids.. teh snomen woudl be too scary for them.-Alex
B004GEYL9M,Amazon Customer "&#34;Insert snazzy catchphra...,4,What more really needs to be said? You either love the series or hate it. I think these specials give Matt Smith an opportunity to show some emotion they've all but been forbidding him to portray as the Doctor so far. I *know* the actor can do it (seen him outside Dr. Who)...so I wish the writers/directors would allow him.
B004GEYL9M,Amazon Customer,5,I don't understand why Amazon asks people to rate prequal I mean it's like listening to a song for 30 seconds and then deciding whether you like it or not.
B004GEYL9M,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",5,I couldn't wait for this Christmas special and I was thrilled to see that Moffat was back on his game...A great Doctor Who!
B004GEYL9M,Calkate,4,I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who...I'd give the show 5 stars...and this episode was pretty great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't like the new intro and the new interior of the Tardis is going to take some getting used to.
B004GEYL9M,David Keith "Mr. Keith",5,Terrific beginning for Clara in a very unusual Dr Who Christmas special. The BBC has really outdone themselves with a special that turns the special conventions on it's head. A most unusual companion introduction that's like none you've ever seen.  Can't believe we'll have to wait until autumn until we find out what happens next!
B004GEYL9M,David Smith,1,$1.99 for this a 2 minute trailer of the 2011 Christmas episode!!. What up with that!! charged for a two minute preview for the episode.
B004GEYL9M,Dennis Maloney,5,Let me start by saying I like all the Doctors but Matt Smith &#34;had me&#34; from the moment his head popped out of the TARDIS in Amelia's backyard.  Smith's specials have been entertaining with The Snowmen being the best of the bunch in my opinion
B004GEYL9M,DesignerDiva72,5,We finally get to meet Clara...the Impossible girl!Great episodes - The Christmas Carol (Though the CG was pretty cheesy)The Snowmen - Awesome!!!
B004GEYL9M,D. M. She,1,I don't know.  Scary snowmen?  I suppose after all these years it is difficult to come up with new stories.  I paid to watch this one and wish I hadn't.  Really miss the writing of the first couple of seasons of the 'new' Dr. Who.
B004GEYL9M,Fillionista,1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!This is NOT the episode.It is the under 2 minute "prequel" that is available FREE at the BBC America website.Someone at Amazon is either incompetent (at best) or greedy (at worst).I OFFICIALLY ****PROTEST**** BEING CHARGED FOR THIS.
B004GEYL9M,Jacqueline "ys diva",4,This special had it's high points and it's low points but Matt Smith was amazing all the way through. Not to mention the fantastic Ian McKellen added his amazing voice to yet another sci-fi franchise. Defiantly worth a watch for fans new and old.
B004GEYL9M,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Really enjoyed the episode..did leave questions but I am thinking answers are coming in upcoming season. Would have loved a bot more snowmen but it was a great episode.
B004GEYL9M,KWACK12,5,Doctor Who is an awesome show!  I always love the Christmas specials and this one was no different.  It even leads into the Doctor's new companion!  LOVE IT!!  WATCH IT!!
B004GEYL9M,LAgirl,4,So far season 7 of Doctor Who has been mediocre at best but the latest episode hopefully is a sign that this season is getting more intense. And with the 50th anniversary coming up. Steve needs to blow all of us fans away! Can't wait to see what's in store for 2013:)!
B004GEYL9M,Leeanne,5,I have watched Dr. Who since the beginning.  When I became housebound and found it on my tablet I watched it again from the beginning.  It just gets better and better.
B004GEYL9M,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",5,Dr Who has become a real favorite for me and I love these specials as they add so much to the series.
B004GEYL9M,Lil'Dove,5,Awesome!What away to get the Doctor back in the groove of saving the world.A must see for every Who Fan.
B004GEYL9M,mommymarly "mommymarly",5,Best way to watch Dr. Who... and really looking forward to the rest of the season! (Easy to set up and watch over and over!)
B004GEYL9M,notwing,5,am almost a fanatic when it comes to viewing DOCTOR WHO.will enjoy all issues of the doctor. watching season 3 now
B004GEYL9M,Pippi La Pue "&#34;Pippi&#34;",5,Love the Christmas specials. And the Christmas Carol has become a yearly favorite in our home. It is just such a wonderfully different telling of the old classic.
B004GEYL9M,R. Young "LORD's Servant",5,This is good as all the rest. If you are a Dr. Who fan then you don't want to miss this one.
B004GEYL9M,splash "splashjam",5,Another fantastic season for Doctor Who. My son and I enjoyed this episode thoroughly.
B004GEYL9M,The Doctor,5,Matt Smith is awesome as The Doctor.  The Doctor is such a great character and Matt Smith performs excellently in the role.  The plots are well written and clever and the action unfolds in a fun and enticing manner that draws the viewer in and makes them want to see what's next.
B004GEYL9M,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,5,There's nothing like sitting down to watch this show.  Doctor Who continues to keep this crowd entertained.  BBC has done an outstanding job casting and producing this show!!
B004GLTK2I,Seven,5,This series was dropped before it had a chance to grow. The potential was there. I dare say it would have been as great as Arrow had it been given half the chance. Worth getting.
B004GTOKM0,Amazon Customer,5,This series was very well done and the actors were believable as their characters.  The series inspired me to read the book which also was enjoyable.
B004GTOKM0,Aud,5,I enjoyed seeing characters from other series I have watch in a different role. I really enjoyed this series. I like there was no swearing and could watch it with children in the room.
B004GTOKM0,Bonnie Chinnick,3,Slow getting started but it picked up.  Waitung for season 2 to become available for Prime members.  You will love it.
B004GTOKM0,B's Mom,5,This is another great period show similar to Lark Rise to Candleford.  There were several episodes so the character development was sufficient.  Was hoping for more episodes but no luck.
B004GTOKM0,chai,5,I have been  watching Downton Abbey and thought this would be similar. Loved the characters and the story line. I highly suggest it.
B004GTOKM0,cindylou,5,This series was so heartwarming.  The setting was very beautiful and authentic to the time period.  The stories were very interesting and uplifting even though some one died in every episode.  The series made me laugh and cry.  It was a series that my husband and I watched marathon style....We couldn't quit watching.!!!!
B004GTOKM0,C. Perez "c. perez",3,I couldn't get into this and I love Judi Dench. I'll give it another try and rating. When I started watching it I may have wanted something that grabbed me from the start and it fell short.
B004GTOKM0,Don Montgomery,5,While this is the best story around to demonstrate the strength of womenin a restrictive society some of my favorite scenes like the reaction of the women themselves to Matty's store were missing. That scene alone was the best in demonstrating friendship over social mores.Don't mess with original film just to save space Amazon---it's not fair!!!Would love to see the original again.
B004GTOKM0,G. Higley,5,Fantastic cast.  Very well written.  Wonderful mix of comedy and drama.  My only criticism is that it was way too short.
B004GTOKM0,G. Montour "GEM",5,If you love Judi Dench or Downton Abbey or any of the pastoral early to mid 19th century stories give this a try. You'll find lots of famliar faces from similar light dramas.
B004GTOKM0,HFC,5,This type entertainment is exactly what I enjoy--it's clean as well as interesting and has a very talented cast.of actors and actresses.
B004GTOKM0,Jadeda "grma_p",3,I didn't really care for the show. The only reason I watched it was because I think Judi Dench is fabulous. But don't really care to watch much more of this show.
B004GTOKM0,John,5,I really enjoyed this movie.  Dame Judi Dench is one of my favorite movie stars.  She is fantastic in all of her movies and she always picks the movie she wishes to be in as an actor.
B004GTOKM0,Kindle Customer "Mex Lover",3,I really can't write an accurate review as i only watched the first episode of the first season and it couldn't hold my attention..(but then i had just finished watching all the seasons of 'Downton Abbey) and maybe it biased me as i enjoyed the latter so so much.
B004GTOKM0,Kyle W. Doan,3,nice look back at diffeent time but a little slow. Worth a watch and at times very entertaining. put on the b list and hope for a winner
B004GTOKM0,Lurch,5,BBC stars at the best.  An all star cast that is worth the watch.  BBC brings the best to your tv and the stars in this show know how to get the best or a great script to make it even better.  It is a night of great entertainment.
B004GTOKM0,Margaret L. Albright,5,I enjoy all of the acters and actresses in Cranford and enjoy the English shows and this was as good as any I have seen.
B004GTOKM0,Max Mustang,5,Judy Dench carries this exceptional BBC costume drama to new heights. Along with Upstairs & Dowton this is a keeper.  Highly recommended.
B004GTOKM0,Melanie,5,This is a great period piece.  The acting is outstanding.  I have watched the first three episodes and am looking forward to watching the rest of them.  Characters are believable and it doesn't take long to get involved.  Judy Dench is a favorite and she doesn't disappoint.
B004GTOKM0,Mona,3,I watched a bit of this...and stopped.  I will get back to it..but thus far it really didn't grab my interest.  I will watch it through though.  Eventually.  What I've seen just didn't interest me.  It might be different for someone else.  It's always a gamble when you buy a film if you aren't familiar with it.  I bought it because I usually love films from that period.
B004GTOKM0,Nanners "Music Mom",5,I so enjoyed this series.  The costumes were awesome!  The main theme behind the story is the cost of progress and how it affects the lives of a town.  I loved every single character and loved the surprise ending.  I haven't read the books but now I am going to.
B004GTOKM0,O. Mallard,5,If you love Judi Dench and/or British shows you'll love Cranford. I enjoyed every mintue. Looking for all the other I can find.
B004GTOKM0,opirty "opirty",4,Well acted Engish period series.Interesting subjects.Acting & interesting scripts moved the series along nicely.Hope it maintains the quality in the future season.
B004GTOKM0,Patricia Maierson,5,Beautifully written and acted by a phenomenal cast!  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical dramas.  There is a fair amount of humor as well.
B004GTOKM0,Rebecca McCord,5,My husband and I loved this! Judi Dench is fantastic and all of the actors are superior....I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this!
B004GTOKM0,Sandy Nicholson,5,This is another winner as far as I'm concerned.  Well acted and good story line and continuity.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show.  Judi Dench is fantastic!  Can't wait to see more.
B004GTOKM0,Suzanne Fisher,5,This is a great story and the actors are wonderful. Judi Dench is such  a wonderful actress. I enjoyed this very much
B004GTOKM0,Suzanne,5,Cranford is totally charming from the first moment.  I found myself watching 2 shows in an evening... and searching for the second season.  Please tell me there IS a second season???
B004GTOKM0,tin man,4,Why did it end? I saw a few episodes and then no more. I was getting into it and there were none to be seen. I hope Amazon will get more. The ladies are intriguing.
B004GTOKM0,T. L. Smith,4,I enjoyed it but it is not even close to &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; or &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34;. It is okay to watch but it didn't wow me.
B004GTOKM0,WTO,3,This was kind of sad as some old maids were stuck on old customs and unreasonable principles.  Thankfully it ended on a positive note.
B004H20ST0,curlygirrl,3,I really enjoyed the story but could not get past these characters continually smoking around a seriously asthmatic child. Who does that? Certainly not a mother who rushes home to her ill child's bedside.
B004H20ST0,Vyctorya,2,I don't think this film is worth the cost.  It moved too slowly and never captured my attention or interest.  Something was lacking in this film.  I don't think it is worth the cost.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B004H3H270,Christopher J. Cowen,4,[Featurette] Salt - The Ultimate Female Action Hero was a great video that had some  very good behind the scenes features.  I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie and Liev Schreiber so any chance I get to see more of them is a good thing.  I enjoyed this Video Featurette and would recommend it to others.Thank you for reading my review.
B004H3H270,Deena L Gilbert,5,Suspenseful with high energy following the unfolding of this story is worth it.  You will be as surprised at the ending as I was
B004H3H270,Kemosabe,5,Fun to watch.  As a fan of Angelina Jolie it was nice to hear cast and crew praise her for her professionalism.
B004H3H270,microsoft is not monop,1,First of all angelina never was hot and this mvoie needs a plot.  Totally lame done over a weekend hunk of crap shown in big theaters.  LAme lame leaaamee
B004H3H270,shaz,2,i love anjelina jolie- she is a great actress and she was in the movie- i didnt read the whole description and its not the movie salt so really disappointed
B004H3H270,the Commish!!!,2,that it was the movie it was only a clip an run for only a few seconds and ended quick
B004H3N6DO,Alice,3,Very entertaining.  Sometimes thought provoking.  Too much opinion and conjecture. The graphics are very good.  Wish it had more academic evidence.
B004H3N6DO,Amazon Customer,5,Put together well. I use it to sleep =) Very informative but how are you supposed to know what's true and what's made up?
B004H3N6DO,B. Seymour "Kudzuman",2,I feel compelled to watch it because it is so bad. The theories have more holes than swiss cheese and the &#34;authorities&#34; have no credentials whatsoever. It is like the campiest thing ever filmed.
B004H3N6DO,C. Cameron,4,Program is put together well. Covers various topics and how alien contact could possible be an interactive part. Each show is well put together and easy to follow and understand.
B004H3N6DO,Greg,5,Gets the mind thinking about the what if. Are we the only ones? Helps to come up theories as to how and why some of the unexplained still doesn't have answers.
B004H3N6DO,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,It may be that aliens are making this show to mis direct us :) but it is a lot of fun :)
B004H3N6DO,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",4,This show has been everything and more that I expected.  I'd like to see constant updates and new information all the time.  Keep it interesting.
B004H3N6DO,Leo Hott,5,I love all shows dealing with Cryptozoology & unexplained phenomenon's.  I think that whether you agree or disagree it definitely provides you with a lot of information about wonders that exists on our planet.
B004H3N6DO,Mary,4,I enjoy watching this show in all seasons.  I don't agree with all the theories they are proposing but it gives me food for thought.
B004H3N6DO,Shelly Iniguez,5,I like watching ancient aliens because of all the facts that are given to you.  Even if you don't believe in aliens this is great to watch because it opens your mind to other possibilites that are all around us!  If you want to have something to think about watch this series!
B004H3N6DO,Skipster "I'm just saying ...",5,Season 2 picks up where season 1 left off. The usual suspects and gang are all back again with their perspectives and takes on a multitude of history's and antiquities best unanswered or unexplained events locations and stories.
B004H3N6DO,Toby De La Pena,5,I really find ALL the series interesting and my son and his girlfriend are watching the series!!!!!  I will be view all the rest of series shortly! Thanks
B004HBOLJY,Fergy Dog,4,A very solid Doctor Who story with outstanding characterization in the voice work which almost overcomes the very poor to the point of distraction animation! It was still a solid lead and one has to wonder why they did not go forward with more as all they really need do to make this a top notch production was find people who could animate rather than run schematics. Worth your time if you love the TARDIS.
B004HBOLJY,Lil'Dove,5,This Animated story is very well done. It expands the interesting cover ups of governments in all nations to hide the truth about aliens from the people. No wonder the Doctor has to come and help us so much as a people.
B004HBOLJY,The Doctor,5,This was a well made animated episode of Doctor Who.  David Tennant delightfully reprises his role and does the voiceover for The Doctor.  I highly recommend this to you if you are a fan of Doctor Who!
B004HTAGOK,Agramma,5,My granddaughter and I love the mystery of this program and have watched it since the very first airing.  Love it.
B004HTAGOK,David Asensio,5,i like this show there are not many enjoyable family shows for kids i watch this with my niece and nephew after school nickelodeon is the channel they watch the most im glad to see to it has long following of seasons when you like to have some family time with kids try it they might like it
B004HTAGOK,M,4,I really Enjoyed the series. I hated that some of the characters went away but the new ones were good too
B004HTAGOK,Pamala Pickard,5,It was hard to stop watching.  I saw it once or twice on TV then couldn't find it. It was greate to  see the whole story.
B004HY87C8,Diana Strole,5,I love true crime shows and find them interesting. It is unbelievable how many people in this country disappear and are never found!
B004HY87C8,Jeffrey T. Kane,5,This is just one of the best true crime shows I have ever watched.  I love every episode.  No wild speculations or weirdo psychic frauds just straight facts about interesting missing persons cases.
B004HY87C8,Kindle Customer,5,I love these true stories on missing persons.  It's so interesting to hear what has happened to these people.  I can't stop watching...
B004I0C0QK,D,2,I just cannot get into this! I thought it would be as funny as the Simpsons and Family Guy but I just couldn't get into it.
B004I0C0QK,Lyns the cook,5,This show is something else. I would have it on loop if I could. I think my family would hate it after a while. But bob is hilarious. Linda is hilarious. The kids are hilarious. Everyone in the show plays a specific part that is not seen in other movies or shows. It just so good you have to see it to understand.
B004I0C0QK,Scarlet,5,I love that H. Jon Benjamin is part of this project. The episodes are funny & the extras are quirky.
B004I1I914,Denn,5,Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.Great series and worth watching if you like cop shows.
B004I1I914,Duncan Brown,5,We have a friend in the force and he told us things were just like the show presents. I found the acting gritty and the flawed characters real. You love and hate them at the same time but I was always rooting for them.
B004I1I914,Moonbiter,5,Great show.  The acting is so good it makes it really easy to get lost in the show.  Definitely worth the time.
B004I1I914,sam,5,It's about time we had a television show that really tells it like it is.  It is great entertainment and I could not stop watching it once I started watching.
B004I90IW4,David "Black Widow 2014",5,this movie was pretty good. i like the story and the actors were great. this was a pretty intense film. it was a very good movie. the director's insight on how the world might end was pretty good. this was a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004I90IW4,nythawk,2,This movie could have been great if they had more production money. The actors probably took 80 % of the budget. They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that. Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive? Was this the end or the beginning of the end? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck(it bombed worldwide) without much substance? Was this a waste of 92 minutes? Tune in for the sequel. OK folks you can breathe now there is no sequel planned..at least not yet!!!
B004I90IW4,Robert Pylant,5,Normally I dont like movies produced by Magnet - lousy acting etc.... But this little Gem is one of Magnet's better films...The shadows are closing in!!  and in the dark people just disappear and their garments drop down - who is taking them?  for what reason??  and why??  This film will never give you an answer  which is what makes it so creepy...I give this one five stars and recommend it to everybody to see.... oh not to be a spoiler but two people to make it outside the city...
B004I90IW4,seetheartsoftly,5,got it really early love it satisfied customer great dvd just like I remember the movie to be. now I am a happy camper
B004I90IW4,violet rose,3,i didnt think this movie was as bad as some as the reviews.........i thought it was a solid nice sci fi movie......the idea was eerie & maybe it was some  kind of a re boot of society idea type of movie......i did find it odd the animals were able to survive the dark shadows....hmmm maybe cuz the animals are pure & didnt need re-booting & unlike humans who have been so jaded & corrupted etc they needed a fresh start.............maybe thats why the ending was the way it was.........the people left were the "purest" choice.......my only complaint was it was so dark for most of the watch but i still enjoyed it................
B004IJQ792,Carol J. Wooldridge,5,THIS WAS A REALLY CUTE SHOW.  I ENJOYED THE SEASON AND NOW I CAN  WATCH IT ALL AGAIN WJEMEVER O WANT.
B004IJQ792,Page 2,5,This is funny and I can almost believe the actors are real. Very entertaining. I would watch this series and recommend it to all my friends
B004IJQ792,Patricia Appelquist,3,You can imagine my disappointment when I realized that the series is film in Vancouver and the SF skyline and city shots are CGI in and aside from the CGI they must spend a ton of money on the main charaters wardrobe.That being said the believability of the bending of the law makes this show fun to watch all the while you are studying for the bar exam you have to be grounded in reality somehow because this show does take some liberties.None civil of course.
B004IY9DQQ,Christine,5,We find him to be extremely amusing but I can see how people are offended.  Watch at your own risk.
B004IY9DQQ,Donett Murphy,1,Raw...not what I expected. I was surprised this was accessible by anyone. I am not a prude but was offended.
B004IY9DQQ,James Westervelt,3,his shows are edgy but he sometimes gets a little too gross for me. A couple of the shows were extreemly funny
B004IY9DQQ,Rod,5,Daniel has a very unique sense of humor. He can be very rude and very racist at times but that is part of the act. Comedians all have their own material that should not be censored. I have hear a lot of people dissaprove with his style but for those that don't mind someone blunt it is pretty darn hilarious.
B004IZ1V1A,Foster,3,The unusual use of the victim's voice is the only thing that saves this show from the dull normal level of story telling in most of the reality TV shows out now.  It is still maddening to spend most of the show recycling a few scenes from different angles although editing does seem a bit better than average.  Not worth my effort to see again.
B004JM9BXM,CrimsonKannon,3,Daydreaming of being human or longing for humanity while having to be condemned to live as something to fear is interesting.
B004JM9BXM,Ma'am "Ma'am",3,Something for fans of horror.  This takes it to another level where you more than sympathies with the lead characters.  I got board with their situations after awhile and stopped watching.
B004JM9BXM,Necie,5,I really enjoyed the series I wish there were more epiosdes to watch I got really interested in the story.
B004JM9BXM,Pulpman,4,I really enjoyed this show it is a lot better than I thought it would be.It follows but does not copy the story line from the BBC version. There are distinct differences. It is the differences that make the show worth viewing. I like the characters as well as the arc story lines. The actors are very good and believable in their characters. the writing is very solid and the stories move along at a brisk pace. You will enjoy this show even if you are into the BBC version. I own both shows and we like them both at my house!
B004JM9BXM,Roxanne,3,I like Sam Witwer (Aidan) but Aidan Turner (Mitchell) plays the tortured vampire much better in the U.K. version (original) of Being Human. Sam Huntington (Josh) isn't the whiny werewolf that Russell Tovey (George) is and I much prefer Russell's version as it makes him more interesting. Meaghan Rath (Sally) just isn't the bubbly ghost that Lenora Crichlow (Annie) is and Lenora's version is just adorable.I'm not sure if I'll continue to watch this series past the free episode but I bought both seasons of the U.K. version as the British actors give so much more depth to the characters making the series a must watch.
B004JM9BXM,Stephanie Lynn Moore,5,You never know what to expect when the series starts.  Edge of your seat thrills.  This opens the mind and makes you think.
B004JM9BXM,Wolfar,5,One of the best Television Series out today. The combination of the three really mixes well and different for a change.
B004K0HGIU,Carolyn,5,This is a HILARIOUS SHOW!  Each actor has been perfectly picked for their role. I love Betty White. I think this is the best series she's ever starred in. They all have great chemistry with each other. You can tell they genuinely live working together. Great guest stars too.
B004K0HGIU,charles ackley,5,Season two leaves off as funny or even funnier than the first season Valerie and Betty white are a riot
B004K0HGIU,Janet Lynn,4,Hot in Cleveland is laugh out loud funny. I really like Betty  White and the whole cast is great and has talent!
B004K0HGIU,K'ann Strohl,5,All 4 women are AWESOME!!!They click!!! One of the best comedy shows I have seen. Keep up the  wonderful shows.
B004K0HGIU,M. Engel,5,Supper funny and entertaining.Character Elka makes the show be funny with her old lady eccentricity.  The other lady's just add the topping to an overall witty show. Light and easy to follow
B004KCIO52,IMHO "IMHO",3,Hmmmmm......the show is getting kind of boring.....I think this is the last one we're going to rent.Good try though.
B004KK77FC,Bob K,4,I like this show.  ERA airline owners seem like a nice family and the show gives a lot of insight into life in rural Alaska and how essential planes are to keeping the small towns and the bush pilot lifestyle alive.
B004KK77FC,Colleen Gregory,5,Having once lived in Unalakleet this show is extra special. It shows the wild side of Alaska and the great people that live there. Its a show my husband and I can enjoy together. Keep them coming.
B004KK77FC,Leo 1171,4,I'm a pilot and I love to see what these guys do.  Esp. When I feel the same way in the little guys I fly too!
B004KK9C3M,ed schreiber,3,Mr. James Elroy's voice is rather monotonous.Very repetitive in speaking about the murder cases in most scenarios.Good locations
B004KK9C3M,Kathleen,2,The egg and I would have done better. here is a nerd who obviously wants to be a murder dog. ( give me a break) With his ingrating voice and his nerdy ways giving us a blow by blow of his own mother? How sick can you get??? A voice man might have made this fly. Did this man view this before putting it out? Did anyone advice him to hire an actor with a good voice to do the narration? Guess not or he thought he was this sexy detective type . Grand elushions an't the word.
B004KKA0YC,readinglarge,4,It's like a wreck you can't quit gawking at.it's informative as how they got that way but omg the homes make you gag and its just sad these people think they are helping these animals and sadder when they go so if you do watch this series grab a handle and maybe a barf bucket and be thankful it's not you.
B004KPX56C,beth and chris,5,outside! outside! everybody outside!line up! line up! everybody line up!and i'm starting to understand that when they are telling stories they are still underwater but are subject to the laws of nature and physics that would be in place if they were in the place where the story is being told. when they are not acting out the story they are really underwater and for the most part the environment reacts the way you would expect to to react. sometimes i still get frustrated when they swim up ladders or spray water or drink from glasses.
B004KPX56C,Britney,5,My daughter started watching this when it first came out and it is now my 2 year . old sons favorite show.  the songs are very catchy and there is a lot to learn and interAct with.  this show saves me when I need to get something done. My 6 year old will still watch it along with my 3 year old and soon to be 2 year old.
B004KPX56C,Debbifaye,5,Little ones love anything to do with the Bubble Guppies. She knows all their names and Bubble Puppy too.  Hope there are more soon.
B004KPX56C,Erin "sneimraej",5,My child is finally loving specific shows and is showing strong preferences and requesting this one above the rest.  I like that this show is not annoying and the songs are super cute and we can dance around the house to them.  Highly recommend!
B004KPX56C,Eyelin Serena Huerta Guizar "BigMommy",4,I just give them 4 stars because c'mon people! They are under water and have trees and airplanes? My daughter likes the songs and they show an interesting way to learn.
B004KPX56C,Gennes Council III,3,I'm not particularly fond of this cartoon but my son seems to love it.  He has since he first was introduced to it.  It's ok
B004KPX56C,gregory,5,This show is a hit in our house.  We just love watching this all the time.  Plan to purchase all seasons
B004KPX56C,HannahLynn,5,Great show. Colorful. Good songs! But we need more than season one one prime! My daughter loves it & we've watched all of season one 374924729 times!! Add the other seasons please!!!!
B004KPX56C,JC,5,My child loves this show and is learning from it too.  Definitely worth checking out for your toddlers if  you have any.
B004KPX56C,JCraul,5,My 2 yr old daughter just loves them.  The songs are catchey.  Both my husband and I find ourselves singing along.  It is an educational show that is easy to get into with them.
B004KPX56C,J-Squared,5,infant son loves the show. it's not so bad I can sit and watch with him without wanting to kill myself.
B004KPX56C,Kristin L. Weiner,5,My kids love this show. It's one of my 3 year olds favorites. I just wish amazon had more prime seasons.
B004KPX56C,Libby Bryer,4,This cute little series is all about singing and my 4 yr old granddaugter sings her heart out with these little guppies.  I find myself singing with her and it brings a lot of joy into the kitchen while we're baking cookies.  I like the segment about bones and it gave us an opportunity to explore bones on our bodies together. Cute harmonies while learning.
B004KPX56C,Lisa M Wiley,5,I have two young girls and this is one of their favorite shows.  I always appreciate a children's show that encourages learning!
B004KPX56C,Michael Hayes,5,This is one of my sons favorite shows along with Team UmiZoomiIt teaches him while he watches and doesn't realize it.Great show for kids
B004KPX56C,Mo.C,4,My three year old daughter really enjoys this show. The songs are pretty catchy and its fun to sing them to prepare her for what's next in our day!
B004KPX56C,Nikki,5,My three year old loves the Bubble Guppies.  We watch far too many shows yet I am particular about what shows.  Bubble Guppies and Oswald and Fresh Beat Band are currently the top three.  I just opened my email to find a receipt for season 1.  Apparently I need to change the purchasing settings on the computer so that my three year old cannot buy them herself.  :)
B004KPX56C,Nukumach,5,I'm giving this five stars because not only does my daughter loves it but both my husband and I love it too. We love the music in it.
B004KPX56C,Nycgirl,5,Love the bubble guppies. My kids have learned so much from this show and the songs are catchy but not irritating.
B004KPX56C,RayInLV,5,They just love these shows that used to be on Cable TV.  We use services like this instead of cable.
B004KPX56C,TIna Cubero,5,My youngest son was in amazon prime video section on my Kindle Fire and found the guppies and played the first episode and was hooked. Now he likes to watch them every day.
B004L3OAAS,colleen,5,I enjoy these true story episodes and this one rates right there at the top for me.  If you are into this kind of thing you're going to enjoy these shows.
B004L3OAAS,JCook,4,This series holds your interest. The series chronicles stalking laws and the development of stalking laws among the states of the U.S.
B004L3OAAS,Lady Raven RAVE!,5,Another good show on Discovery ID. This is and was an eye opener for me. This show cases people who were stalked and I was surprise at the little things that would trigger stalking and how hard at time it is to get the police to do something ( because of their guide lines). The stalker has to to something for them to do something about it. Its so scary how far someone will go to stalk you.
B004L3OAAS,Rating My Best Pick,1,I thought this was a series of movies not the actual show. This was a mistake I was expecting a movie.
B004LK8K66,Diana Strole,5,I love watching these episodes and it is uplifting that these kids change their attitudes after visiting the prison.  I think this would be beneficial in all states where kids are just starting to make bad choices.
B004LK8K66,george lopez,3,Really enjoyed watching this. The female prisons are far worse than the male ones.Some of the kids never change and end up in prison.
B004LK8K66,Jo-Rell "The Word",3,the show like many others seems fake at times. i don't know if it is but it seems very fake. i just watched the first EPs. on prime but have seen it on TV so i can say some other EPs are good. you just have to give it a try if you like keep on watching ..
B004LK8K66,Louis J MaSCITELLO,4,I saw an article about this from a few years ago in a leading psych. magazine.  They said it &#34;doesn't help&#34;.  ALL of the programs believe that they're a success &#34;if they help one kid&#34;.  They do.It's amazing to see the differences from program to program and from batch to batch in the same institution's program.  Some of it is so heartwarming to see..but some is just plain funny!  Look for the little kid towered over by the BIG guy!
B004LK8K66,Nursesarah001,5,It's an interesting show. We enjoyed watching it. Seeing the progress at the end if each episode sort of restores your faith in humanity.
B004LK8K66,readinglarge,5,A chilling look at prison life through the eyes of trouble bound teens and what a wakeup call it is.something that should be viewed by all kids headed down the wrong path.
B004LK8K66,Richee,4,I wish I could have went to one of these when I was a kid. Maybe I would have stayed out of trouble and away from the scumbags I hung out with.
B004LXIPAO,BrendaMarie,2,I think there may be some value here.  I didn't watch it to the end because of the strength of the tension in the show.... not for me.
B004LXIPAO,D'arcy L. Mcgreer,1,There are other movies you can waste your time and this one would still be a looser.  A typical end of humanity world that is based on some distant future to our own.  Gets convoluted.
B004LXIPAO,Tunist,1,I've really got nothing good to say but since I have to fill this space with something I'll just reiterate that I have nothing good to say about this at all. Good luck to those of you that partake.
B004M1UERW,Cathy Hale,5,Good informative series. In you like to take things apart. You will love this show. Kids can learn a lit
B004M1UERW,Larry R. Rhude,5,A learning experience that otherwise I would not have known. Too bad you can not give your reason for your rating in a short concise manner!
B004M1UERW,Lurch,5,Here is a show that lets you see things you may not even know exists.  I love to learn new things and to see wonders that you may not have any reason to even know was created to make a job easier.  It may inspire you to creat something new give it a try
B004ML1HY6,Charlotte Puderbaugh,5,This is good wholesome viewing for a child. There is lots of teaching and no violence. Holds a childs attention and makes learningfun.
B004ML1HY6,Debbifaye,3,Liked original best. Like the format better in the older ones.
B004ML1HY6,E B Fricks,5,My son loves baby Jaguar! Good story Diego is for kids a little older than the Dora group. A happy show teaching children a little bit about Hispanic culture while Diego has his adventures.
B004ML1HY6,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,Diego draws the young ones in a wholesome way. My grandson (aged 3) enjoys and learns prereading skills through watching Diego and his many adventures.
B004ML1HY6,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,My almost 3 yo granddaughter every now and again orders new episodes :) try to be angry with an adorable little red head. These programs are her favorites and super interactive and educational!  I don't even mind watching a few.
B004ML1HY6,Kristin L. Weiner,5,My boys age 3 and 5 absolutely love Diego. It's an educational show that teaches them all about Animals. I love that all the season are available on Prime.
B004ML1HY6,Prentice House "LEE",5,Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in.
B004MPCIMC,Booker,4,Thumbs up for CC well acted well produced well directed. An overall good product and consumed well by me ok
B004MPCIMC,Dlpearman,4,Chicago code was a short lived network police drama. It features excellent acting and interesting interwoven story lines.Once you view the first two episodes you will be hooked for the series. It is time well spent.
B004MPCIMC,Ethel K. Robinson,5,This was a great series. I have only one complaint--it did not run long enough.  I would have loved to see what that devil did next.  I would have enjoyed knowing what the final outcome of his fate.  Whether he continued to spin &#34;his&#34; version of good and evil the way he saw it.  I am surprised this series did not run for many seasons.
B004MPCIMC,Jim,5,I liked the people in the show and the plots were different and exciting. It was a good show right up to the end.
B004MPCIMC,nurse_judith,4,The crime runs rampid in Chicago internally and externally and the top cops want to clean it up.  That isn't so easy when the all mighty powerful make it seem impossible.  Who will pay with their blood for not going along with the scum running the city?  Great Chicago sights and great acting go hand in hand in this very good adult police drama.
B004MPCIMC,Philip Logiudice,5,I have always heard that Chicago has been a very corrupt city. This series focuses on some of the corrupt practices. I keep wondering what the current situation is in the windy city? Can be any where as bad as the show portrays? I am assuming the show has overdone this. It is still very entertaining.
B004MPCIMC,P. Lafayette "revalois",5,I loved this cause it was so different. I get a little bored with all the killings and blood. This show keeps your interest up. As always all the actors were superb!!  I HATED to put it down.  It's too bad they discontinued it.
B004MPCIMC,Raymond J. Brunner,4,I love watching this show. It is gripping and just down right exiting to watch. This is a real winner
B004MPCIMC,Robert W. Evans,5,I really like the show it shows what cops can do to try to make Chicago safe and I  love every epasode
B004MPCIMC,Roy A Nelson Jr.,3,So this is another show that was canceled before it's time.  I have not watched all of the 1st and only season yet but I'm enjoying it.  I do love cop shows.  My all time favorite is probably Southland.  So the grittier the better.
B004MPCIMC,Steve Lawrence,5,I have really gotten into this series. It's very intense at times and shows the corruption that Chicago is famous for. It really gives you some insights into Obama and his minions.
B004MPCIMC,TomG "CW Junkie",3,Needs a little more &#34;Law and Order&#34; style polish. Moved too slow for me and my family after years of L&O.
B004MSP04C,debra marrero,5,I watched the whole series with these characters absolutely loved it... did not even know about it and glad I found it.
B004MSP04C,Joan,5,Love this program.  The actors are great and the story line is good.  I was glad to see Season 4 coming.
B004MSP04C,Theodor Black "Theo Black",3,Why does the cover show them at the super market? They never all go shopping once in the whole show.  Anyway this season is the death of the show in my opinion.  In season two they made Mitchell do something so horrible it killed the character. What they are doing with the big bad is silly and they are even introducing new characters to replace the ones they destroyed.  Of course the only problem is they don't have the chemistry of the original group and you can tell.  I loved this show so much when I saw season one.  I don't know why they made the decisions they made in two but three seemed like an attempt to patch the holes created in two and in the end they did something big.  &#34;Spoiler&#34;  They kill Mitchell and Nina but Nina lives but is dead at the start of season sour so everything is just depressing.  Oh and there is a Vamp/Human world war.  Joy.
B004MWZLYC,Alicia Yates,5,Watch this you will not be disappointed at all & the eye candy is nice too! Great show!! Can't wait for next season
B004MWZLYC,Amanda C.,4,Same review as I gave season 1.  No mystery as to what will happen but I like the characters.
B004MWZLYC,Amazon Customer,4,A worthwhile series about a US Marshall who is an amiable gunslinger in Kentucky. I am enjoying it and would recommend it to others.
B004MWZLYC,Amazon Customer,4,I'd give this a 4 Star.  It is a bit more intense than the Rockford Files and a step ahead of The Glades. Seasons 2 and 3 are what I'd call Better TV.
B004MWZLYC,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,Sparks fly between enemies of this quiet spoken Marshal who confronts all situations with his own sense of right and wrong with a wry sense of humor. Interesting and sometimes outright scary characters populate the story. Lively interaction with this deputy Marshall's ex wife lend a sweeter flavor to this second season.
B004MWZLYC,awilderirishrose,5,Got hooked on this series during season one.  You have to be able to watch a lot of violence to view this show.  There s also a lot of great humor.
B004MWZLYC,azloree,5,This series has some excellent writers which make it as much about comedy as they do about crime and violence.
B004MWZLYC,Beverly Johnson,4,Many of the shows are similar in story but the story continues to evolve. I enjoy watching the characters. Well done.
B004MWZLYC,BILLB,5,Very Good TV !The Show maintains the quality of the Elmore Leonard created characters. Plot development is uniquely Leonard and always fun and challenging.
B004MWZLYC,Bill E. Bissett,5,Modern day gunfighter surrounded by very articulate hillbillys with great wit and barbs between vey beleivable people.  Great fun!!! Highly entertaining
B004MWZLYC,Brabass,5,This series has it all! Every episode will leave you wanting more. If you enjoy explosive action scenes mixed in with some humor. Then you will love this series.
B004MWZLYC,Brian,5,This show is not slowing down. This is the modern cowboy without doing it cheaply. One might not believe Kentucky hillbilly crime would have more than one season's expression but this show finds a way.
B004MWZLYC,Bruce,5,what a great show. very macho though. my wife says too much violence. i says plenty of action. great writing.
B004MWZLYC,C. A. Neal,5,I thought there might be a story letdown after season 1. This did not happen. Season 2 has a great storyline and the characters become more interesting. This is a wonderful tv show. Watch it!
B004MWZLYC,Carol B. Johnson "Sasha's mama",3,I didn't like season 2 quite as well as season 1. I felt like it got progressively more violent instead of more interesting. Perhaps  that's to be expected as he becomes more and more involved in the lives of various citizens. Some of these families are like the Hatfields and McCoys; there is bad blood between them and you just know there is bound to be violence in the picture.
B004MWZLYC,Catheter "animal lover",5,More excellent lawman shoot 'em ups in Season 2.  We love this series....for anyone who loves modern cowboys who are smart and dead-on shots...this is for you.
B004MWZLYC,C. Gifford "CCChris",5,Anyone from a small town can relate to something in the show.I like that he is a badass and speaks his mind
B004MWZLYC,Chris St Pierre,5,We love this show and the characters are all developing quite nicely. It is indeed a hit in our house.
B004MWZLYC,Christoph Forbes "AlabamaFanLouisianaMan",4,Am waiting for the final series to be available on Prime.  I have enjoyed this series very much.  Timothy Olifant is the perfect fit for the lead.
B004MWZLYC,Clark A. Lucas II,5,Ralan stays true to his code even in the face of defying his criminal father.  Shows all others that crossing the &#34;line&#34; has consequences they can't afford.  Ralan becomes aware of how corrupt Harlan county has become with presence of 3 gangs including Limehouse.  Great scripts with awesome writers makes this one of the best shows and entertainment is at the highest level.
B004MWZLYC,Craig Miller,5,I enjoy the writing and acting.. I can watch  this series all t he time. It looks as though the actors really enjoy their work.
B004MWZLYC,Crashconklin,5,Reminds me of the good old boys I hanged out with in hot lanta in the 70sThat I went to high school with
B004MWZLYC,Crystal Jackson,5,It was action packed.  Full of drama from cases to case.  The family dynamic that seems to surface in one way or another adds more suspense and action to the whole storyline.
B004MWZLYC,Cub,5,I am really going to miss Justified when it goes off the air following the sixth season. It is absolutely the best show of it's time.
B004MWZLYC,CVB,5,Couldn't wait to get into season 2 since the first season was definitely not enough. Of course the BEST thing about Justified is Timothy Oliphant and Raylan is such an interesting character. Backed up by even more great characters and the actors who play them. It bothers me that a place like Harlan and the stuff that occurs there might exist but the show is great entertainment.
B004MWZLYC,Dancy Girl,5,Loved watching each episode of Justified.  Am looking forward to the next season.  Will be watching and waiting for the coming episodes.
B004MWZLYC,Danny L. Abernathy,4,pure escapeis  sponly flaw is all the cursing and references to JESUS and GODwhy don't the writers ever use mohammad
B004MWZLYC,Darrell Irvin "Darrell druidwriter",5,Always something going on. Dealing with the moonshiners put the U.S. Marshal's office on high alert. The writers have woven a great believable tale.
B004MWZLYC,Debra D. Thiele,5,I very much enjoy watching Justified it is not only a riveting  and entertaining story line; but it also is an adult themed story line of good verses evil and has spots of comedy for relief of the drama.  I rank it up there with NCIS  and Law and Order except the story line does not stop at the end of the hour but continues threading itself till the end of the season.  This is NOT a show for children to watch due to content. in my opinion.  I love the depth of the personalities of the characters in the show  A must watch program for adults who seek out  mature entertainment.
B004MWZLYC,Debra J. Meyer,5,Love this show.  Great writing. Great acting. Never a disappointment.  The wind up to the climactic finale was first rate all four seasons.  Can't wait for Season 5.  Right up with there with The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad.
B004MWZLYC,DEEZEE,4,It is an ongoing story. Like a soap opera without too much soap and no aliens so far. I'll watch season 3.
B004MWZLYC,Denise Spors,5,Great series I didn't want it to end. Good themes and plots for everyday episode.  I believe it was the casting that made it perfect.  They certainly have me waiting for more.
B004MWZLYC,Dennis Charpentier,5,I give this series five stars in all categories. The program is well written with good story lines. The acting is great and the continuity of characters is well done.
B004MWZLYC,donna l. krause,5,The most consistently entertaining series I've seen. Love the cast and the story lines . Witty dialog funny situations. I've seen all 4 seasons and am waiting for the 5th.
B004MWZLYC,Douglas Tyler,5,The screen writing and the actors.  We are very fond of the lead in Justified and enjoyed his performances in Deadwood.
B004MWZLYC,Dr. in Pasadena,5,This is a great story told about a flawed man who is just trying to do what's right (most of the time).
B004MWZLYC,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",5,This is the way to watch TV. Interesting take on a very back holler community and a no frills gun slinging US Marshal that just keeps the good stories rolling.
B004MWZLYC,Dr. William Costello "Dr. Bill",5,Brilliant script and top-rate performances; will remind you of Faulkner or Shakespeare.You will not be disappointed; try it !
B004MWZLYC,D. Walters "Florida Boy",5,This a great series -- interesting and always something new. Plenty of action and always plenty of great one liners that keep it light and enjoyable. The hero and the villain are both likable and the interaction is realistic with twists that keep you on your toes. Definitely one of the few really outstanding programs on TV today!
B004MWZLYC,frugalcrafter,5,It is enjoyable to see the U.S marshal get himself into and out of some fun predicaments. I will watch and see where the story goes next.
B004MWZLYC,gary blakely,5,yep more than season one...cant wait for season 3.........who else can gert shot who will die and who wont the next seasongrab your shotgun
B004MWZLYC,Gary D. Groves,4,Walton Goggins is also great.  He was the number 1 costar of the shield.  Hooray for Amazon prime with all of these series I missed are available free on a smart TV
B004MWZLYC,Geoff Masci,5,A good series. Season's one and two are terrific. I've now watched through into season 5. Watch it - it's a great cinematic novel !
B004MWZLYC,gizzy,5,I really enjoy this series. Especially the way each episode links to the other and is finally resolved somewhere along the way or at the end. Extremely good writing. Love Timothy Olyphant and the rest of the cast. I'm already watching season 3.
B004MWZLYC,grandma,5,I have to keep watching one after another they keep you so interested.  I love the funny things that just pop in every once or so
B004MWZLYC,Guy Portland Oregon "Guy Portland Oregon",5,very very good show lots of violence tho like the actors winona boyd arlo and the chief marshall watch if you can
B004MWZLYC,Happy Flamingo,5,Each season gets better and better. I think it helps to see the episodes as a marathon to get the feel for all the characters. Timothy Olyphant is so georgous with those teddy bear brown eyes.
B004MWZLYC,Helen J Powers,5,Unpredictable..and so entertaining. The characters are so different than any other show. Fx shows are not mondane. Love this show!
B004MWZLYC,Ira,5,I watched him as the sherrif in dead wood and he is a great actor and justified is a really well produced show.
B004MWZLYC,Isaac N Hoagland,5,I enjoyed the first season of this series but the writing got better in the second season.  You could also tell the actors had more fun with their roles.
B004MWZLYC,jasper,4,This is a series that I intend to continue watching as i see Season 3 is available.  The characters and the story liine are well-devloped since the beginning.
B004MWZLYC,J. C. Miller,5,the acting is great-i am from the south and i feel very at home with the way the characters are depicted and the dialogue is  rings true
B004MWZLYC,Jean Capps,5,The acting is great and the characters are well developed. My husband and I both enjoy the stories and Tim Olyphant is adorable! I think we'll be seeing more of him as a leading man.
B004MWZLYC,Jeff Riley,4,This is a great show if you like a continuing story. It's got plenty of interesting characters and lots of action. Every show is filled with excitment and never a dull moment.
B004MWZLYC,J. N. McCarthy,4,IT is an enjoyable series and the leading man is a different kind of law enforcement character.  If you like different twists and turns you will enjoy Justified
B004MWZLYC,Joanne,5,Timothy Olyphant....what more is there to say!  The plots are fun and the dialog is great with many lines that make you chuckle.I love the verbal sparring between &#34;Boyd Crowder&#34; and &#34;Marshall Raylan Givens&#34; & Timothy Olyphant!
B004MWZLYC,john Dinger,5,I have been following this show ever since it came available on TV.I enjoy every episode as well as Seasons and look forward to this tv show as it becomes available.
B004MWZLYC,Joseph J Mallory,5,I like the stories. Its refreshing to have some entertainment on TV. I am tired of seeing programs and then wondering at the end what was that about. Most don't have stories that makes any sense.
B004MWZLYC,jpwhel,5,I really like the developement of the characters in this show. The US Marshall with his screwed up family and personal life is portrayed in a very human context.  Raylan Givens is a very quirky guy.  I hope they can continue the series for a long time (this is questionable ginven the number of characters that wind up being killed each season).
B004MWZLYC,Julia A. Antoon "shamoonya",5,My friend suggested I watch Justified.  Well let me tell you I am hooked on this series.  It really is well written and the actors are supurb.  I am on season 3 right now and am still enthralled in it.
B004MWZLYC,JULIE DONALD,5,I have really enjoyed this series. Great actors and story line. I keep wanting to watch just to see what will happen next!
B004MWZLYC,Karen P,5,I am totally hooked - just love this show - just the right amount of good and bad guys -add more seasons amazon :)
B004MWZLYC,LacrosseD "LacrosseD",5,Found Justified on Amazon Streaming 2 weeks ago and have been addicted ever since.  I quickly tore through season one and I am enjoying season 2.  Keep an eye open for those Deadwood cameos!
B004MWZLYC,leo clark "bob",3,kind of stays the seem plots are not imaginative. I think the first sixepisodes were pretty good then it kind of got stagnant and neverwent back to where it was.
B004MWZLYC,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,5,This was ..is  a great show the story line was spot on .Love  all of the story plots keeps on you toes. great show thanks amazon for the chance to watch all 5 series
B004MWZLYC,magicboo2u,5,I already rated season one and of course this is just as good. Give yourself a treat and watch it!
B004MWZLYC,Mazie101,5,Every category that you expect to see in a series on TV  - This surpasses all.  The writing is &#34;new&#34; - the actors are justgreat and the characters in this are - interesting is an understatement.  Appreciate this delivery of a great show in this day and age.  Keep on with the work at hand.
B004MWZLYC,M. Blackledge "Everyday user",4,It is definitely different and from life experiences fairly accurate in some regions.  Timothy O. is one of my favorite actors and pulls it off with a sense of realism.
B004MWZLYC,Michael J. Scott,5,Each season adds a new plot twist while satisfying the older ones. Outstanding television series designed for the discriminating thinker with a taste for violence done well.  Highly recommended.
B004MWZLYC,Michael L. Lowenstein,3,I found the show to be intriguing with a group of charters to follow the story line . I think there is just too much violence for my taste .
B004MWZLYC,Michael Sullivan,5,It's the wild wild west in modern day kentucky. Great characters and lots of action. This show gets better every year. Hope the story continues to be interesting and people bad guys keep getting their &#34;Justified&#34; treatment.
B004MWZLYC,Mike,5,I like the characters in this show and love the setting.  Raylan Givens is a bad man with a good heart who carries a badge.
B004MWZLYC,Miki scott "hippie mom",5,Raylan (sp?) Givens and all the characters are back in this second season and it is really heating up. I'm holding my breath about the middle of each episode to see what is going to happen.  I could watch this series forever. Hope they stay on 10 years at least! The acting is superb.
B004MWZLYC,Millie Lee "Love Southern Fiction",5,...and the episodes with the Bennett family (especially Mags) were the best ones. The whole Bennett clan was incredible in a twisted kind of way.
B004MWZLYC,M. Weber,5,I love Justified and this season I thought was even better! Everything moves quickly and the gritty nature of the show continues in season 2. I have binged watched season 1 and 2 with my wife pretty quickly and we can't wait for Season 3
B004MWZLYC,Nancy L. Burris,5,This was so much fun to watch. Timothy Oliphant does a great job in playing his role. It is about a side of life that many of us thankfully never know about. His references of understanding the nature of the community from being born there are really funny. It is a good guy vs. bad guy film but lots of fun along the way. It is not for children. I enjoyed it all.
B004MWZLYC,Nan,5,I love this series. Can't wait for more. It has a little of eveything. So thankful for not much foul language.
B004MWZLYC,Newbee,3,It was good but they need to make Boyd a permanent good guy!!  He can do what the law cannot!!!!!!!
B004MWZLYC,NLJ,5,But we hate waiting for new episodes! My husband really enjoy this show. We wish there were more episodes quicker. Hurry!!!!
B004MWZLYC,pam gee,5,i absolutely love this show.it is very entertaining . just can't wait for the next episode. now i have to wait for another season
B004MWZLYC,Patricia Duhon "art lover",5,This ongoing series has compelling and interesting characters that are extremely well acted.  It relates to a part of the country that is largely unknown.Well-directed and well-played.  Binge watched all seasons and wanted more.
B004MWZLYC,Paul,5,Love Justified. I don't know how much more you can say. If you like the TV Show it's a winner.
B004MWZLYC,Pauline Norton,5,Excellent series. Glad I'm watching it on my Kindle that way I don't have a week to see the next chapter. ''''''''''''''''finished the series in two weeks. Never thought I'd like the hillbilly scene but i found it spell-bounding. There's action in every chapter. I definitely recommend it .
B004MWZLYC,Philip Logiudice,5,We love this series. The actors are great and the story lines are so interesting. It is very pleasing to see that Elmore Leonard's work has been successfully brought to life in this series.
B004MWZLYC,Phil Levin,5,Outstanding dialog with wit and subtlety.  Season two focuses on charters from the &#34;hallar&#34; and their battle against the big coal mining company come to rape the land.
B004MWZLYC,Phyllis Henkel,5,My son was watching Justified when I came to visit...I watched 2 episodes and became hooked....I am now on season 5!!!
B004MWZLYC,P. K. Nolen,5,We got into this series and just finished the fourth one and waiting until the rest of them come up on prime. Can't wait.
B004MWZLYC,Raymond J. Brunner,4,I think this is a great show and very interesting to watch. My wife and I both enjoy it. Way to go.
B004MWZLYC,Richard L. Depatta,5,Olyphant is just as crazy as he was in Deadwood. So many great Cameos from past actors from other series makes It more interesting.
B004MWZLYC,R. Miller,5,The action continues where season 1 left off. Has all the action of season 1 and I love it. The plot thickens.
B004MWZLYC,Robert J. Curry,5,Well played and acted police series.  Most episodes keep you well.entertained.  Interesting twist to police show.  Worth purchasing to watch the show!
B004MWZLYC,Robert M. Kirwan "World Traveller",4,-I love season 1 and 3 and would like to give them all 5 stars but season 2 had too many character turns for my liking.  Almost every character... it was like they changed writers or something.
B004MWZLYC,Rob Lynn,5,Has an excellent story line with awesome characters. Has that wild west appeal for me. Relaxing to watch but at the same time  puts you on the edge of your seat by the end.
B004MWZLYC,Roger,5,The more I watch Justified the more I like it. Just finished season two and am now onto season three. More and more of the best television series are coming from cable -- I would highly recommend it. I would add that this show is really ONLY suitable for adults as there is some questionable content that quite frankly it doesn't need and would still be a great show without it.
B004MWZLYC,Roger L. Boese "FirstConsultant",4,Rylan Givens shooting bad guys and a girl.  Solid escapism.  Well defined consistent characters.  The plots are simple and reasonably effective.
B004MWZLYC,Sam P. Morgan Jr.,5,Justified is a great story done well by good actors.  You (men) willl identify with Raylan and you will like Wynona.
B004MWZLYC,Sam Rashid,5,This entire series started off quite slowly with respect to any kind of a story line and I almost dropped it after three of four episodes. DON'T MAKE that mistake.  The story simply takes off after six or seven episodes to the point where I'm binge watching it now.
B004MWZLYC,Steve Lawrence,5,I have really enjoyed this series. I like the ability to watch two or three episodes at once. Beats those ridiculous zombie and vampire shows.
B004MWZLYC,Sudsy,5,A great show with a terrific cast. Story lines are well done and true to life.A pleasure to watch.
B004MWZLYC,Susan C Johnson,5,All time favorites.  A continuation of the first season - greater expansion of characters.  It's the bomb. Love love this series.
B004MWZLYC,TJC,5,I love this show. The characters and acting are both excellent. I especially like the relationship between Raylan and Boyd. When they are on screen it is usually some of the shows best moments.
B004MWZLYC,T. L. Smith,4,I really enjoyed this series. I would prefer not to hear all the bad language used. I think it would be just as good without the curse words because the storyline is good.
B004MWZLYC,Tony,5,I have watched it and love the acting.  Some of the story line is a bit over the top but entertaining.
B004MWZLYC,Vicki Butcher,5,We miss seeing Timothy Olyphant in DeadWood. So nice to have a show that is similar with a lot of actors for the HBO season Deadwood.
B004MWZLYC,Vicki Fleming,5,The writing and acting continue to amaze and delight.  We can't wait for the next episode.  Will probably purchase the series.  Amazon streaming is great.
B004MWZLYC,Vulcanicus,5,Its all good! like the main character and all the supporting actors for this. The situations are believable and continue to fascinate me. Every now and then they put some badly needed humor in to lighten up what in some cases is a very dark story line. So far I have through to the 3rd season and can't wait for Amazon to make the fourth and fifth season free as well. Can't seem to find them anywhere else so far...dammit!
B004MWZLYC,webbsb,5,This show just keeps getting better! The twists amd turns keep you guessing and interested. The writing is top notch!
B004MWZLYC,webhawk50,5,Justified continues to be one of my favorite TV shows.  The writing and dialogue is intelligent and authentic; acting is outstanding.
B004MWZLYC,William R. Kolbe,5,I love this Southern noir stuff.  Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins are outstanding adversaries.  One episode just hooks you for the next go round.  Can't wait for the fifth season to be released on Prime.
B004N2LUXM,Cathy Dunican,4,This show was pretty enjoyable.  It shows the journey of 2 obese people in the struggle to lose weight  I watch it as I walk on my ellipitical  If you like reality TV and enjoyed shows like The biggest loser you would like this it is a condensed version of that type of show
B004N2LUXM,Jennifer D. Williams,5,This show was very inspiring! It did not show the participates in a negative way at all.  It simply shows real people with real life struggles.
B004N2LUXM,Joan Richardson,4,love watching people with sever health issues be able to transform their lives and be more healthy.  seems to be honesst and presents their struggles
B004N2LUXM,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,3,I WATCHED IT BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD . THE PEOPLE WERE COMING INTO IT KNOWING THEY WERE TO LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE THERE WAY OF LIVING..!!
B004N2LUXM,nancy,5,I enjoyed this season very much. Thought the people were very real.
B004N8OT0C,Amazon Customer,4,If you like guns & competition shows this is defiantly a show for you as well as seeing some of the most awesome weapons use through the years as well as new and improved. I really enjoy this show
B004N8OT0C,drscot,4,This is a great show for gun enthusiasts and marksmen. I am going to watch more of this program. The historical aspect is fascinating as well.
B004N8OT0C,Dustin Boyd,5,Great show if you are into weapons and even if you aren't. I personally own 0 guns and this is one of my favorite shows. Competitions is always a good thing and this is a competitive show and fun to watch.
B004N8OT0C,Kevin burns "kevin Burns",5,I choose 5 stars because who doesn't like to be competitive and what better than with guns you judge a person by how he look but most of the time your wrong on his skills as the show proves that
B004N8OT0C,Kristy Perkins,5,Great season. Colby does a great job hosting. The competitions are fun to see. You get to see some weapons that are awesome.
B004N8OT0C,Mystery Shopper,5,It's really cool to see all the competition using so many different weapons under so many different conditions.  I much prefer the team competitions where they are paired up while competing...adds another dimension to the enjoyment and you get to see who is a team player vs. lone wolf.
B004P0WM84,glacierbear,5,What if you lost all your supplies? What if you had to exist with out your stuff? What would life be like with out the comforts that you have prepped for? Could you survive? Follow these nine individuals as they start out and see how they do it and watch the mistakes they make. See how many make it to the end.
B004P0WM84,Mike Dougherty,5,wish they get more like it on prime. wife and i really enjoy this type of reality show. season 1 was good too
B004QMESVU,Anne Lee,2,I usual enjoy movies with Uma Thurman but Ceremony tried to be  a romantic comedy yet failed. The tempo was slow and the actors mediocre. Ceremony is simply a movie not worth watching. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money to purchase this movie. I wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B004QMESVU,Barbara E. Blanco,1,Thought I would pull through it but dumb got dumber with the actors and the plot. Once liked the actors now I think they had and off day or off plot
B004QUD8KE,Gizmo "ctwin60",2,This program is ridiculous! Are employees and CEOs really that stupid? I am sure the employees are hand picked to insure they tow the company line. How can that many employees have such sad sob story lives? This program is just an infomercial for businesses that treat their employees poorly.
B004QUD8KE,Kristy Perkins,5,Glad corporate people are doing this. Although I think it is a bit ridiculous to have some do something that could bring harm to themselves or others. If they don't know what they are doing they shouldn't be doing it.
B004QUD8KE,night player,4,Like this show on Tv and like to see the episodes that I have missed. Will watch more later. I like the end where the boss is exposed.
B004QUD8KE,T. and A. Raymond,5,Great show! Good family show! Would recommend to people of all ages for a good watch. Let's you sit back and evaluate some of the things in your own life.
B004RZMQCE,AER,5,the opening episode really got me hooked. I like the character development and all the twists and turns. Lots of double crossing going on in this little town.
B004RZMQCE,Alvin Campbell,3,Keeps my interest.  Good plot line.  Since I have only watched one episode it is difficult to give a very detailed review.
B004RZMQCE,artist in residence "artist in residence",4,I enjoyed this story line until he messed around with his cousins other half but...I enjoy the challenges he faces and the scenes of the country.  Watched both seasons and hated to see it end.
B004RZMQCE,babsd,5,I am still watching this series and look forward to more episodes. The characters are worth the time and interest. The plot lines deviate from the normal police drama.
B004RZMQCE,ChristyB,3,Single Handed is a really good program -- always interested in what the police man's life is like in other countries.  The family can watch this one with you. Only wish there were more seasons.
B004RZMQCE,Cynthia W. Wright,5,Exceptional story line with great leading characters.  A land both beautiful and foreboding in its landscape.  I watched all the episodes and only wish there were many more.  A high quality show with believable story lines.
B004RZMQCE,Daphne,5,Good family British programming sorry the seris ended truly enjoyed it... Keep the seris coming.. Good plot and stories a Must watch
B004RZMQCE,David S. Cowan,3,Very slow moving and without captioning much of the dialog was lost to me due to accents...  But ultimately a very good plot twist and an outcome that made it worth the time...  I will watch more...
B004RZMQCE,D H Leschot,5,These episodes were my first with this series and I could hardly wait to move to season 2.  Had to use the &#34;closed caption:&#34; button but it was worth it.
B004RZMQCE,Donald E. Silva,4,Single-Handed is a detective story that takes place in Ireland I believe. It is full of the stuff of life without the Hollywood theatrics. It is engrossing and worthy of one&#8217;s attention. I highly recommend it.
B004RZMQCE,exwyzee8,4,I really like the charaters in this story and the twist about the half sister was a real surprise. I am excited to see where the story goes next.
B004RZMQCE,G. Higley,3,A nothing special &#34;Police Series&#34; about a young Irish cop returning to work in his home district of rural Ireland.
B004RZMQCE,greenapple,4,We really enjoy watching these shows.  It has good stories that keep you guessing on who did it and why.  We look forward to watching additional episodes.
B004RZMQCE,Jessica Fritz,5,Extremely well done with a great cast. Discovered it by accident and I'm so glad I did. Big fan of mysteries and I would recommend this one highly.
B004RZMQCE,Joan M. Poole,4,This show was rather interesting but once again for $7.99 a show and there's three--I personally wouldn't have paid for it.  If people enjoy watching these type of movies which is possibly BBC pay for a membership of $79.00 for a year---to date between my books and movies I have saved over $600 to watch these type of shows.  Where are you going to get a return on your money like this.  I do have 2 kindles and only permitted one free book that qualifies but the most of this money was saved on movies.
B004RZMQCE,Katherine B. Brewton,4,I enjoyed the 3 part series.  Wondering if there will be more.  First rate acting and story line one I could relate to.
B004RZMQCE,Kathleen Caires,4,Liked seeing the non-tourist view of Ireland.  Also liked seeing the contrast between old Ireland and new Ireland and how they have evolved.
B004RZMQCE,KOBAM,5,The cinematography alone makes Single-Handed worth watching the drama and thrills are along for a very enjoyable ride. I will watch all the seasons.
B004RZMQCE,Lizzie,5,the scenery and colloquialisms common to the Irish was a treat! The continuous story was cleverly devised and very human!
B004RZMQCE,mainer,4,Wasn't sure at 1st. about this series but I soon became hooked. The characters take awhile to unfold & you begin to see how things are not what they seem.
B004RZMQCE,Mark Price "Laborman",4,These are well-acted as most of this British genre are.  The scenery is also beautiful.  But they are pretty heavy.  The main character turns out to be pretty complex.  There are all types of characters who are regulars in the series or appear for at least one episode.  The only trouble is that there are not very many likeable characters.  They all have character flaws.  The stories are good and draw you in.  But by the end of the series you are willing to say good riddance to everyone.
B004RZMQCE,Pam Swope "PSwope",3,I really wanted to like it but just couldn't get into it at all.  I noticed there were several seasons so I may try it again.
B004RZMQCE,Rainyj,3,I watched in all the way through...I just did not think that the acting was that good and the plot or how it progressed was boring...probably won't watch any of the other episodes.
B004RZMQCE,sam,5,Love this show. The friction between the father and son.  The mystery of what would happen after the son figured out he slept with his half sister. Ver very good.
B004RZMQCE,Tom Stevenson,5,here we go again a certain number of words necessary when fewer words would do just fine to give a thumbs up.
B004RZMQCE,Verna Metzger,4,This show was a nice surprise. The story lines are interesting and the characters and story have depth. Very interesting
B004RZMQCE,Wiliam Myers,4,Had never watched this series before and didn't know it even was on line until Amazon Prime -- very good series -- well worth the time and watching
B004SKLP70,Cortney Yonker,5,I love this show! I can't wait for more seasons to come. I love how it keeps u on your toes. I just which they were longer.
B004SKLP70,hidden,5,Enjoy the show.  Nothing more to say.  We'd like to be able to watch every episode with our Prime membership.
B004SKLP70,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,Love this series and was so excited to find the new one. These people have such great personality and work ethics! Would love to see more of this kind.
B004SKLP70,Janet Lynn,4,Stories are good and just the right duration. It is good at the end they let you know if the person was convicted or waiting for trial.
B004SKLP70,Kimberlily,5,I grew up watching Cops as a teenager. Something about catching people that break the law is thrilling go me. Manhunters is the older cousin of Cops. Manhunters catches fugitives that know they have broken the law and are running to avoid recapture. I find myself praying for these officers throughout the show their job is so dangerous! In a nutshell the show is awesome!
B004SKLP70,neon,4,this series shows how much hard work and dedication the Manhunters must have with there job .shows informative job details.
B004SKLP70,Robert W. Evans,5,I really love the show it shows what our law enforment has to do to get the bad people in jail where they belong.I would reccomend this to anyone
B004SKLP70,Success,5,An excellent program! Can't get enough of watching the U.S. Marshal service hunt down and capture wanted felons and murderers. A great show.
B004SKQHYQ,Deanna "Deanna",5,I love watching this show.  The acting is good and the mysteries are always interesting.  For some reason Amazon has discontinued seasons 1-11.  I had only made it up to season 9 before that happened.  I had to skip to what was still available which is seasons 12 and 13.
B004T9BAPC,r. laver,5,this show is the best episode ever and i love it i think it is a must have.thank you
B004TJRCNG,babydoc,3,I Like this show because the story line has a lot of twists. It keeps you guessing and when they finally solve the case it's surprisingly tragic.
B004TJRCNG,Cub,5,Season 1 and 2 of &#34;The Killing&#34; is the best crime thriller since the original &#34;Fugitive&#34;. It is ingeniously written and contains delicately interwoven aspects of the main character's personal lives and battles. I can't count the number of twists and turns in the story. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
B004TJRCNG,Donna Smith,5,I really enjoyed this mystery! Kept you going til the end. The characters are great and the acting is so good!
B004TJRCNG,Encino,3,Good story line. Would have rated it higher but for the excessive soap opera drama.
B004TJRCNG,Frank W.,5,The style of the drama seemed so appealing and bit different from what is mostly on TV?  Why?  Because the writer is Danish and the Danish murder mystery writers are my favorites.  The actors are well chosen and totally excellent.  Luvit.
B004TJRCNG,Lynn,5,I gave this 5 stars because it's suspense! I love a good mystery of trying to figure out who did it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspense and mystery type show.
B004TJRCNG,Marti Ellis,5,This is one of those mysteries that takes so many twists and turns that you stay glued to the screen and try to get sight of the ONE who really did it!! I recommend this to any one who really likes the challenge of a good mystery!! A 5 star @ the least!!
B004TJRCNG,mjordan,5,This is an interesting story that covers the days from a young woman's murder.  It has more twist and turns than a snake.  So if you enjoy good drama watch this.
B004TJRCNG,Paula "Dalmom",5,I love this show.  I couldn't stop watching it once I started.  The end of episode cliff hangers are great!
B004TJRCNG,Wiliam Myers,5,Taking place over a 2 season series - this is an excellent watch --- delving into the personalities of all and their interactions --- great!  looking forward to watching season 3 ----
B004TJRCU4,Cathy Hale,5,Great cast. Interesting detail of a murder investigation. Takes you places that shows usually don't. Plus the main characters all have interesting personality defects. Great show
B004TJRCU4,diamonds,5,first season was great could not wait until the second season came out.  first season was a great whodone it
B004TJRCU4,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",5,I like the loger storyline rather than every episode is another solved crime. They are solving it in a more realistic timeline.
B004TJRCU4,Patricia Doherty,4,Unrelenting rain and gloom gets hard to take but the ACTING is great and  the PLOTS are tight.  A lot of characters to keep track of over time.  A very good episodic mystery.
B004TJRCU4,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,5,The fact that police plant evidence to convict the innocent man of crime is often justified by their personal belief that a suspect is guilty.  Even the guilty get evidence planted against them.  This miniseries would make juries think twice before committing themselves.
B004TPTH56,inspectorudy,3,This is a story about a bunch of samurai warriors who are about to be past by in time into the modern era. They have their loyalties to different Lords whom they are committed to protect and obey. The problem is one of one of the lords is bad and has terrible things in store for the entire country if he is left in power. One of the lower lords decides to stop him but cannot do it openly. He gets his samurai and some others to plan an attack to assassinate this bad leader. That is the crux of the story and the development of the individual characters is part of the fun. It is subtitled but you won't notice it once the action starts.
B004TPTH56,JOSE PEREGRINA DE LA P,4,It is a good movie in some moments slow but it is a good title to pass the time on a weekend.
B004TPTH56,Joseph Marrero "manvscode",5,Wow.  This has to be one of the best samurai movies I have seen in a long time.  It starts out slow but the final battle is awesome!
B004TPTH56,M. J. Perrone Jr.,5,This movie is flat out awesome.  Very similar to Seven Samurai in construction.  They build you up for a long time and it is so worth the wait.  Strongly recommend this to anyone remotely interested.
B004TPTH56,norma jean kringer,5,It's an obvious 7 Samarai remake but it was still pretty good.  Or for those who didn't see 7 Samarai  The Magnificent 7 with Yule Brenner would be the English version.
B004TPTH56,Steve Lawrence,5,This movie is subtitled but don't let that stop you. Takashi Miike is known for intense movies and this is one of his best. It's based on Japanese history and the brutality of the era is vividly portrayed. I recommend this for mature audiences.
B004TPTY3G,AUBREYGAMMON3,5,I Really Enjoy The Movie It Was Very Good Movie Like I Sayed That My Favorite Movie Zombie I Never Got Tire Too Watch The Movie.
B004U8LF7K,Jacob Crampton,3,Its what you expected. Watching will most likely make you feel better about your situation. If it aint broke don't fix it.
B004UP3D8M,Bookworm936,2,I didn't like the movie.  The acting was lame as was the script.  It felt like a wannabe grindhouse gone wrong.  There are some one liners said in the movie that were suppose to be funny but fell flat.  The plot is that of a simple revenge movie with no surprises....spoiler alert........if you haven't watched it and want to you may not want to read further...hobo dies taking out final bad guy.  I gave it two stars just for the amount of gore although most is blood splatters but not all.
B004UP3D8M,Consumer 45,3,Plot /storyline predictable. Loner pushed toooo far and then bang! I had nothing to do and picked this movie. I enjoyed Mr. Hauler's other works but here he is just going through the paces....The excess blood just made the movie ludicrous. I would not rerun it nor recommend to anyone!Video quality was perfect!
B004UP3D8M,Robert M. Kirwan "World Traveller",3,This movie reminds me of those old Troma movies from the 80s lots of cheesy unbelievable bad guys getting blasted by a hobo with a shotgun.
B004UP3D8M,Ron Baker,3,Got to hand it to this film for knowing what it is and letting its freak flag fly. Way over the top grindhouse blood bath. I hate to admit it but I was entertained.
B004UUA1YG,CornDawg,1,not worth your time...were Kennedys so absorbed and lack faithfulness as portrayed. Shame on the Kennedy men! Poor acting. Couldn't get past the first episode
B004UUA1YG,grandma,3,Not much of a surprise here but I lived in that time and knew a lot of what was printed and talked about
B004UUA1YG,Here in ocean city "Melissa",5,I love it and watch it quite often. Wish it would be more affordable to own it. Great cast and acting.
B004UUA1YG,James R. Turner,5,Takes you back in time to some interesting times. I didn't remember the events being so close together - gets you thinking.
B004UUA1YG,Kaitlyn,4,I like it. I wonder if the facts are true? I think that people of all ages would like. I recommend it to anyone who has a liking for history.
B004UUA1YG,Karen L. Ball,5,Well acted out. I've read a lot about the Kennedy family and they did a good job of relaying the story. Having watched it this week of the 50th anniversary of the assination it brought back many memories of the times that President Kennedy lived.
B004UUA1YG,LimeyLe,5,Great TV! I am shocked that this miniseries caused so much turmoil. I understand that it was not exactly by the book factually but honestly the story is still great. Episode 5 was heartwrenching. Good series to invest in.
B004UUA1YG,loyce "Media Maven",5,Performances by Kinnear/Holmes/Pepper and Wilkenson are excellent and I was pleased with the production value and have watched this twice and will watch again because I am drawn to The Kennedy Fam and believe this production captures some truths
B004UUA1YG,techie mike,5,Anyone wanting to know about the Kennedy Clan and it's illustrious history must watch this miniseries.. Every actor.. Every single person in this series is the best in his or her craft..! no Question that this is as good as it gets.
B004UUA1YG,WritingIrish "LM Killian",5,out of curiosity I watched this.  Katy HOlmes does a fantastic job in this story playing Jackie Kennedy...she's so good you forget who she is.  It's a great story line and the roles are all supported well.
B004VB5464,marymurban,5,with Spongebob SquarePants. A lot of adults don't like him but I do and I am 65. I enjoy watching with my grandchildren.
B004VB5464,Mikel,5,I loved spongebob even before i had kids of my own!  Now we get to watch it together.  We have every season except for the one currently showing on tv.
B004VB5464,r. laver,5,i love this show it is amazing i love it me and my friends watch it all day long.thank you
B004VJQ7F8,alynne,5,this show is hilarious. It is great to watch while hanging out with friends. I can't wait to watch the new season
B004VJQ7F8,Amazon Customer,4,This is clearly geared towards a younger audience.  The three leads are employed at the same telemarketing firm and share housing.  Lots of partying and questionable judgment.  The characters are well developed and the comedy comes from situations where the guys tend to make the wrong choices.  It is a exaggerated depiction of that time of life in a young man's life prior to maturity.
B004VJQ7F8,dennis sohn,5,I would just like to say that this show is very hilarious and I look forward to finishing up season 1 as soon as possible.
B004VJQ7F8,HannahLynn,5,Hilarious! Love the actors! They do a great job! Kind of reminds me of my college days! Hahaha! Can't wait for more seasons to be added
B004VJQ7F8,Ira,5,Don't let your kids watch it because it is a little edgy....But it is no doubt a funny ass show.
B004VJQ7F8,Jack Carter,1,Only watched a small part of the show but the dialog and content was not the kind that I was interested in.
B004VJQ7F8,Jenny K Carney,5,Workaholics is just a great family friendly show. So happy Amazon got this from Netflix. Just another reason why Amazon rules and Netflix drools!
B004VJQ7F8,Ken,2,Don't care for it but see how many people could like it.  Just not into this type of show.they just don't do anything and keep the stereotype going of the people not striving for anything.
B004VQX4PW,Alvin Campbell,4,My wife and I have Pawn Stars marathon as we like the banter that the guys have and the interesting historic pieces that are presented.
B004VQX4PW,Bet and Net "tiltv",4,I enjoy the mindlessness of watching this show.  The charactors are funny and the stories of the items brought in are interesting.  I always learn some things new and am suprised by what's valueable.
B004VQX4PW,Bill Austin,3,I enjoy the series on regular TV.I would recommend that everyone would enjoy this show.Easy to understand and good clean subject matter.
B004VQX4PW,Bill D. "Billy D.",5,You may think you are just watching a reality show but a lot of history walks through the door.  The experts take the time to explain everything you need to know.  The whole family loves the show.  It is fun to guess what stuff is worth before the experts settle it.
B004VQX4PW,Bozoman,5,Pawn Stars is one of our favorite TV programs.  It is very educational especially when they bring in experts to verify items that have been brought in by customers.  We have learned a lot from watching this program.
B004VQX4PW,C. Hall,5,I don't understand what the other reviewer is complaining about here.  This isn't a random episode selection from Season 4 like he says.  It's just what it claims to be "Volume 4".  This set contains the second 16 episodes from Season 3 and continues in chronological order where "Volume 3" leaves off.  They are releasing all the episodes just in instalments of 16 episodes.  And I think it's just fine considering the content you get for the price.  I'm glad they're picking up the pace on this aswell as American Pickers...just wish there was news about the next set of American Restoration.
B004VQX4PW,David A. Bachelder,5,I've been a Pawn Stars fan since the show started.  Fascinating.  I just wish the rest of the seasons were included with Prime.
B004VQX4PW,Eric J. Fridman "ejf302",5,I have a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34; and the picture quality for every show is excellent.  The show content is a little predictable and each episode is a little similar but it's fun entertainment anyway.  I enjoy seeing all the strange things that people bring in to try to sell.
B004VQX4PW,Felina,5,It's always interesting to see the different things that are brought in to the pawn shop.  Rick and his family are so knowledgeable about most of the items brought in.  When they're unfamiliar with something they bring in an expert.  Sometimes it feels like a history lesson.  Love it !
B004VQX4PW,galaxy1,5,along with seeing some great things people pawn..some laughter is good for the show!..I enjoy it!..chumlee is very funny too!
B004VQX4PW,happydigging,5,I love to watch these guys and learn so much.  They also give you a more real price of things than other shows.  Can't wait until more are available on Prime.
B004VQX4PW,Henri G. "News1",3,This could be a great show.  It usually stumbles before the finish line.Tries too hard to be cute.  Tries too hard to be charming.  Takes itself too seriously.
B004VQX4PW,JCruea10,5,I LOVE this show to death!  The guys that work there plus the unique items and history you get while watching!  Great show!  I wish there were more seasons for free viewing on amazon prime though!
B004VQX4PW,john mager,5,good show.
B004VQX4PW,Lurch,4,Sometimes the things brought in are like wow that is cool.  But you can tell most if not all is scripted.  It is fun but sometimes the drama becomes a bit much.  A show worth watching just to learn some history though
B004VQX4PW,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",5,cool stuff- you never know what is going  show up there. it neat to see and learn history there as well as see the wackiness of the guys and Chumlee.
B004VQX4PW,mlstillman,5,These guys are funny and smart. This show is funny and educational too.  A great show that both my son and I can enjoy together
B004VQX4PW,mongiesgirl,4,I love the learning aspect of this show.  You can see some really neat things from our history and learn about them. However the staging of the show is a little poor quality. Maybe it's just that ordinary people can't act. But they try!
B004VQX4PW,Nh granite,5,This series is like Antiques Roadshow for the rest of us.  It always entertaining and informative.  It is well worth the 1.99!
B004VQX4PW,night player,5,Great series. Amazing what people have to get rid of. Great characters and good story line. Have enjoyed every episode from the start of the series.
B004VQX4PW,Richard L Thompson,5,Fun show to watch.  When there's nothing worth watching on regular TV we switch to streaming off the internet and watch a lot of Amazon shows.  We are Amazon Prime users.
B004VQX4PW,Sam,1,The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television. &#8203;
B004VQX4PW,Tony,4,Pawn Stars is a fun show to watch.  Love to see the crap that people bring into the pawn shop.
B004VQX4PW,Tracy,5,We watched this show when we had satelite tv and we were so happy it was available to amazon prime members. We like that it is clean family fun and also educational as you learn about the value of some things you may have in your home. We would highly recommend this show.
B004VQX4PW,Victor1896 "movie addict",5,I really enjoy seeing this show for the guys interaction but also for the history they give with each item.  It is amazing what people pawn.
B004VRKFB2,alicia myers,5,the job they do is unbelievable! soooo exciting. if you haven't seen it your in for a treat. watch it youll love it!
B004VRKFB2,Amazon Customer,5,loves me some swamp people.  Love the dvds all the more because I do not have to watch commercials with it.
B004VRKFB2,Ann,5,My husband loves this show.  Very real people and love their accents.  He would love to go hang out with them hunt alligators.
B004VRKFB2,Brett T Moore,5,I love the accents and techniques they use to catch gators.  wish they would show more of the actual catch though.
B004VRKFB2,Carolyn Amos,5,Every show is different. And I love that they did different people not just one family. I never new that people actually hunted alligators until this show.
B004VRKFB2,cottageprims,5,We love this show except Jay Paul and RJ are a little annoying catching the baby gators and thinking the are kings.Ready for season 4.
B004VRKFB2,D. L. Cheever,5,The insight into these fellows lives is interesting to observe. I can't imagine how their hands hold up bringing in all those gators and they don't wear gloves.
B004VRKFB2,dmlopez,4,We watch this because it is one of the few reality TV shows that isn't totally staged.  This shows real people who live off the land and respect what God has provided for them.  They will drop everything to help a friend or neighbor without a second thought.
B004VRKFB2,E. Yeager,5,This is an engaging show. It is amazing job done by people who are facinating in their own right. They are as real as it gets. No fake reality this.
B004VRKFB2,goodynuf,5,This is my favorite show.  I love seeing the way of life in the swamp.  It is amazing to see the brute strength it takes to wrestle the gators under control.
B004VRKFB2,Judith Pritchard,4,Parts of you  want the gator to get free and get away.  Yet it is cool to see such a massive creature over taken by a person less than a quarter its weight.
B004VRKFB2,Larry,5,Love watching these people do the things they do to make a livingSome times the narration is a little dramatic but still a very good show
B004VRKFB2,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",5,What these guys do is dangerous. I worked with baby gators and it take 80% bravery and 20% nuts to do what they do.I tip my hat to them. Great show
B004VRKFB2,RustyShoemaker,5,I love all these seasons and episodes and would love to live In.the swamp that's why I give it five stars
B004VRKFB2,Sherri in Georgia,5,These folks love the land and make their living off it. It is refreshing to watch REALITY without it being a reality show. Go swamp people!
B004VRKFB2,Tracy Christensen,5,Has continued to live up to the previous season's quality programming.  Always an enjoyable show that helps to enlighten one to the diverse conditions faced when living off the land or in this case the swamp.
B004WMKKWK,D. J. KING "clothes horse",4,Good reality t.v. ghost stories. the thought of hauntings is always a fun watch. I wouldn't reccomend it for family viewing though.
B004WMKKWK,jks1980,5,I love this show .... I love the photographic and video evidence. If your not a believer it's at least entertaining!
B004WMKKWK,readinglarge,5,Spooky true ghost stories told by people like me and you.shows state town house everything and has some pretty impressive spooky footage and evidence to back it up.makes me very glad I don't rent or plan on moving ...ever!!
B004WMKKWK,Tech Ed "Tech Ed",4,I have watched the first three seasons of this show and have always been more interested in the background and history of the haunted sites than in the sightings themselves. That leads me to believe that there are many great stories out there waiting to be told.
B004WOZ1F4,Christ's Soldier,4,THis movie was awesome the whole way through! But the ending sucks. Expect a really entertaining and supensful romance but don't expect the ending you want!
B004WOZ1F4,Eric Sanberg,2,I don't want to say that this movie is snobbish but I'm having a difficult time trying to see it any other way.Here's the scoop. It's set in Manhattan and all involved are upper crust professionals. Knightley is married to Worthington. She's a freelance writer for magazines and  he's in commercial real estate development. She finds out he has a real hot co-worker (Eva Mendez) and is upset because he's never mentioned her. Sam heads off on a business trip with Eva and another co-worker and while he's gone Kiera runs into an old flame. Both are tempted and this deals with how they deal with the temptation.I couldn't muster any real sympathy for these people. It's not that I didn't like them but it seemed that there was too little at stake for any of them. All could make a living in their own right. There are no kids involved. None of the relationships have a lot of years attached and none of the relationships are without their blemishes. What if this were set in some blue collar town and the husband and wife were just scraping by and had a lot of concerns in their day to day and some number of young kids in tow? This I think who mean more to the average viewer. And what is the writer/director saying here in that Worthington crosses the line in a big way where Knightley just tip-toes over the line. She was the one with unfounded fears and jealousies where he never doubted her for a moment? Is she less guilty than he?!This is all very professional. All the acting and production values are top shelf. It's just that there seemed to be too little gravity to it. Even when Mendez spills her guts it didn't want to hit home. Sorry. I can't recommend this.
B004WYXHHI,alicia myers,5,love all mob wives wish amazon would put new ones for free on prime!! and new swamp peeps too!!best!!! gotta watch it.
B004WYXHHI,C. McKay "jewelry godess",5,I saw a couple episodes when it aired live and wanted to see the whole series.  Really like the show!
B004WYXHHI,CrimsonKannon,3,It's both exciting and shocking to see these women so deeply entrenched into mob lifestyle and still try to make their own mark despite it.
B004WYXHHI,drummer593,5,This is the start of a killer Italian girl drama sitcom baby! I love these girls big time! Everyone should have this in your collection!
B004WYXHHI,grace,2,no story line.  not enlightening about life within the &#34;family.&#34;  presenttion of women who probably as street as their husbands.
B004WYXHHI,Theodor Black "Theo Black",3,I've been giving one star reviews to basically all the &#34;Real Housewives&#34; shows because they are horrible.  This show also is kinda horrible but not as bad and I think it had the potential to be a better show long term but in future seasons it seems more scripted.  These are actual people who have connections to the Italian Mob.  Sadly you never get so see them speak to there husbands in jail or talk about real crime.  For that it looses two stars because when I sat down to see Mob Wives I wanted to learn about &#34;The Mob&#34;.  The best part about the show is how comfortable the wives are with crime.  They don't take the law seriously and they are all quite scary women.  They do not fight over someone saying they had cheap eye shadow or if they do it's over the meaning of the insult and less about the product.  It's still a bad scripted reality show but it is more entertaining than some others I've seen.
B004WZ6KXA,Jen Sites,5,I love this movie.  It's action packed plus has a little comedy too. I really like it cause it actually shows Sam in the field. In the burn notice series you hear about Sams war stories but here you get to see one. Plus Bruce looks really hot all shaved and in uniform
B004WZ6KXA,Lincoln County MT "Focused on pinecones",3,Not sure about this one. We watched it but doubt we'll ever re-watch it. It did fit right into the series however so if you like that as we do...it's worth watching but not a must watch. In otherwords you can live without it and not miss much as in background etc. I'd recommend if you are a huge fan of the series but I wouldn't push it or even bring it up to others unless it came up in a conversation for some reason. Sort of a shrug from the old shoulder comes to mind kind of movie. Then again...some people just want more even if it's not fully delivered it does give some more and it isn't all bad...just not great. Three stars is just right.
B004WZ6KXA,Steven T. "Steve",5,It is a nice film explaining the fall of Sam.  See this film before you watch the Burn Notice series.  This will help you understand Sam.
B004X2M3N8,Amazon Customer "&#34;Insert snazzy catchphra...,4,The actors do what they can with increasingly pedantic scripts. There are only a few moments of any real emotion and it feels like the frustrated actors start &#34;phoning it in&#34; by mid series. I miss Davies' writing.
B004X2M3N8,Amazon Customer,5,Everyone will love the original and current episodes.  It is a classic series!  Each of the Dr. Who's have their own character and personality and are great!
B004X2M3N8,Amazon Customer,4,I don't like these 'prequels'.  Therefore I rate them only because I'm required and I will keep getting emails to review it if I don't.  Watch the full episode and it's good.
B004X2M3N8,carolyn d ross,5,great had a lot of parts that the two show did not have due to timing. doctor who is the best
B004X2M3N8,Colleen,5,My whole family loves Doctor Who!!  Our only conflict is which one makes the best Doctor??  Number 10 and 11 are amongst the favorites!!
B004X2M3N8,Coolaid,5,My wife and I are Whovians. We love the show and rewatch the episodes often. Such a great show and I am sad to see Matt Smith go. Must have if you want the complete set!
B004X2M3N8,Dean Collins,4,Kind of lagged in parts.  Some episodes are lame.  More into the inter-personal relationships rather the having more action and thought provoking shows.
B004X2M3N8,Fast Freddy "Fred",5,The first season was great and then each season got better and better.  Where do they find those great writers?
B004X2M3N8,Fillionista,5,Emotional/mental whiplash of the highest measure.  Belly laughs and gut-wrenching emotions coming so swift and suddenly that it's impossible to absorb in just one viewing.  The mind racing to keep up and understand all the implications of each reveal.  A MUST OWN EPISODE if there ever was one.  And there's dozens of those - but this is a topper!)
B004X2M3N8,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,This was a really good episode of Doctor Who. It was surprising and infrmitive and action packed. No spoilers here but really if you have not seen this one do. It will make you want more Doctor Who.
B004X2M3N8,Julie Howard,5,more great episodes with the Ponds and the Eleventh Doctor. Loved watching them all. will def want to watch them again.
B004X2M3N8,lee,1,Do not bother with the HD episodes of this season if you're watching on a TiVo.  They play with a choppy stutter framerate that is terribly annoying to watch.  The low-def versions are fine.
B004X2M3N8,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",5,The seasons just keep getting better. The stories and companions for this season were just so fun. The weiting is some of the best and I like any episode with the weeping angels.
B004X2M3N8,Maestro,2,I think Matt Smith will successfully kill this franchise after 50 years. Too bad old chap! You just don't emote the complexities of the Doctor.
B004X2M3N8,Marshaleigh,4,I wanted to watch season 6 to get caught up in this series. I held off getting into this show because I thought it would be too hard and time consuming to catch up. Not hard at all. The characters really develop over time. Doctor 11 is fun and wonderful. Great stories if you love scifi and fantasy all rolled in one.
B004X2M3N8,Ryan Pritchard "thor_oakenfelder",5,It took me a while to get used to Matt Smith. It felt like the series took a while to get used to him too. Smith really hits his stride in this season. Matt Smith is likable and silly and crazy once you get used to him and once the writers figure out who his Doctor is.
B004X2M3N8,Sherri in Georgia,5,OMG!  What a twist!  I can't wait until the next episode!
B004X2M3N8,Shortcake,5,I love most of these.  I didn't like the &#34;Blink&#34; with the Angels.  It was too scary for me and made my uncomfortable..
B004X2M3N8,Stephanie Lynn Moore,5,Though I will say that some play DR Who better than others:  Each one puts his own spin on the character.  I love this series.
B004X36GNK,1443giggles,5,I really like this show a lot.  It has a great plot and I love the characters.  I am really glad I purchased this show!
B004X36GNK,Amazon Customer,5,Dickens  writing reflects the darker side of humanity but also the redemptive power of love and kindness.  This story stays true to that formula.  Portrayal of all the characters in this story is very well done by many of my personal favorites.  Clare Foy and Matthew MacFadyen are excellent.  Judy Parfitt is brilliant in her role and Andy Sirkus is creepy and despicable which is what he does best.  My husband did not want to watch this at all but quickly found it interesting and intriguing.If you appreciate all things British I highly recommend your investment of time.
B004X36GNK,Amazon Customer,1,NO ONE smiles in this series...at least not the first couple of episodes.We could only watch two episodes...just too excruciatingly boring and grinding.
B004X36GNK,Autumnteton,5,Dickens at his best...good story line and well acted!!  Hard to believe the government thought debtor prisons were the way to collect debts!!  Nice sub plot with a little mystery to keep your attention.
B004X36GNK,Blue isle #3,5,It was gripping with actors presenting each character to their fullest. Just could not wait to see what happens next through each segment. Did not know that Charles Dickens could write such a vivid book explaining of each one actor(s) trials.
B004X36GNK,Carolyn D. Smith,5,Excellent series.  Lots of intrigue and mystry.  The characters are great and it is well acted.  Highly recommend this period piece.
B004X36GNK,cg showalter,5,I watched ths once before and loved it so much I had to see it again.  Well worth the time spent! A very good production.
B004X36GNK,CTM,4,This is a great historical and education series.  True to the period in time very well written.  Good acting great story keeps your attention.
B004X36GNK,exwyzee8,5,I have watched this mini series 3 times and I love every minute of it. Every part is perfectly cast. Every line is perfectly delivered!!! Perfect entertainment.
B004X36GNK,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,&#34;Little Dorrit&#34; was one of the most entertaining series we have watched on Amazon live stream.  The story by Charles Dickens was superb and the acting was outstanding.  Especially the actress playing &#34;Little Dorrit&#34;.  We highly recommend it.
B004X36GNK,Jer2911,5,If you like Jane Austen movies you will most likely enjoy this series also. I enjoy seeing the class differences portrayed in these types of movies and how people in difficult circumstances rise above and do their best in contrast to others who choose to become bitter and closed off. Little Dorrit is an inspiration.
B004X36GNK,Kindle Customer "Mex Lover",5,Gives you an idea of the separation of classes that still exists in England. (The accent determines your class). The debtors prisons were real. I love the cinderella ending too
B004X36GNK,KTL,5,My wife and I thoroughly enjoy this series. The best of all is that you can watch it on Amazon Prime for free.
B004X36GNK,Lisa_Minneapolis,5,This isn't a well-known Dickens tale but this is a first-rate production with an exceptional cast and wonderful camera work. The story is very compelling but not the least bit maudlin or cloying. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Dickens.
B004X36GNK,O. Mallard,4,I enjoyed the series - this is an older one. The characters were all so dark and the color wasn't great but I realize this was beforeHD and all the other technology we have today. Held my interest enough that I watched all the episodes that were available.Didn't hold my attention like Upstairs Downstairs or Downton Abbey but interesting enough. Worth the watch. I did like it.
B004X36GNK,suki,4,I love how the Brits portray the times of Charles Dickens. All of the acting is worthy of note and all stars gave excellent performances.
B004XFVLNI,Carla Beasley,5,It's amazing how Rick and his team turn rust into beautiful historical objects.  The peopel who work on each item are top-of-the line artisans.  There's always something interesting that comes into the shop.
B004XFVLNI,Chris Cummings,5,Its the best of American stuff history and the art of restoration all in one.Also a dad and his son learning how to do business together ! Family !!!
B004XFVLNI,Cristina Hiatt,5,I love rick and his son. Brettly is hilarious and I love kowboy. The things they restore are amazing.  Their work is incredible.
B004XFVLNI,gootch "EJ'ER",5,Rick Dale & his team are awesome & they can work miracles on piles of junk & turn things into art. I really dig the Crossovers with the Pawn Stars & upcoming Count episodes. I truly hope History/A&E will release Pick Pawn Polish from Pawn/Pickers & Restoration as well as the new Sturgis programs!
B004XFVLNI,JAY L. KOLKMAN,4,I'm glad this is only a half hour show.  It's the perfect length to document a restoration.  Hour longs shows of this genre tend to contain too many fillers.
B004XFVLNI,Kuhn Rich,5,rick and crew transform junk into jewels they dont sugar coat the process and get results that are show pieces.
B004XFVLNI,randstuff4u,4,Rick and company can really bring the worst looking objects back to brand new condition. They can restore anything from pedal cars to full size cars.
B004XFVLNI,RJK,5,It was interesting to watch items brought from junk to jewels. It is like a restoration of history. It is really worth watching.
B004XFVLNI,RND,5,This is a entertaining 21 minutes of a trip down memory lane.  The staff/cast is quite fun to watch and laugh.  Plus you can see how something old and rusty can be revived again.  Too bad that the next season is a very high fee.
B004XFVLNI,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,I LOVE IT!!!! THIS IS THE BEST SHOW....WHEN I HAD &#34;DISH TV&#34; THIS SHOW WAS TO BE ON NEXT MONTH BUT I HAD TO CANCEL THE&#34; DISH&#34; SERVICE ...2 MUCH $$$$$$...SO NOW THATS IT ON &#34;PRIME INSTANT VIDEO&#34; I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO SEE IT
B004XFVLNI,Rodrigo Garay,4,I really like what Rick and his crew can do. It was good to reacquaint myself with the early episodes.
B004XFVLNI,Speedynyc,4,I find it fascinating that they take junk and turn it into some very interesting items.  They also charge an arm and a leg but hey - as long as the customer is satisfied.
B004XFVLNI,Steve Talamantes,4,I think this is a pretty interesting show. It's neat seeing what seems like junk being turned into treasure. I think if you like pawn stars then you'll like this.
B004XG6D1C,Granny123go,5,I love watching these shows but there are just some things that I would not do for any amount of money; and this is one of them. LOL.  Very entertaining.
B004XG6D1C,Marie "Marie",5,Love this series.  Makes we want to go out and hunt pigs.  They are one nasty animal.  Would hate to live where they are running wild.
B004XG6D1C,Patrick R Smith,4,Good entertainment I enjoy a good laugh once in a while and this show gives me a few chuckles love the working dogs they are the stars of the show.
B004XG6D1C,sue m,3,My received a pup for a gift and it is a &#34;hog dog&#34;. We wanted to see why and we learned different kinds of dogs can be trained to be &#34; hog dogs&#34;. I did not realize how fast these animals reproduce and the damage they can cause. The people who do this for a living won't have to worry about job security!
B004XUMPRE,glacierbear,5,I loved it. The 2 are just starting to gel together . it is enjoyable to watch the 2 of them work through situations. It seems more real than other survival stories on the TV
B004XUMPRE,Kungfujackrabbit,5,Great season and glad i bought this. Its so nice having the option to purchase a season like this and watch at my leasure.
B004XUMPRE,Seth C. Howard "pops",5,see our season one listing ; same here ; Dave and Cody worked WELL together.  great tutorial
B004YLCI74,Judith Pritchard,5,A funny cartoon however I would not let children watch it.  The humor is meant for adults not small kids.
B004YSDQHS,Belizelovely,4,My 3 year old son loves this season. Always new things to learn & the music is great too. Cookie Monster & Elmo are his favorites. Will definitely keep watching!
B004YSDQHS,Charlotte Puderbaugh,5,The muppets are very colorful and my grand child really enjoys elmo and loves to count and sing along. It teaches life lessons while entertaining at the same time. very worth while.
B004YSDQHS,Rich,5,There not a whole lot I can say about this video other than the fact my kids love to see that elmo.
B004YVA9S4,beth holman,5,Was very good if more shows out there please get them.  Amazon you need tto do that.I liked the idea girls school.
B004YVA9S4,J.B.G. "icr4trth",1,I  rated it  one star  only because the  review  requested  it. It started  with  great  promise  but  the  ending  stank.
B004YVAD6M,A. Lynn Bowman "muzikluvrrr",5,If you read my reviews on the first three seasons you know this is one great show.  The characters continue to grow and the show continues to fill the serious dramma and Mary's sceptical point of view is always there to lighten the mood.  Season four has some new twists and turns from the first three seasons that is the perfect set up for season five.
B004YVAD6M,djdave,4,Definitely a little different season than I would have expected. Mary get pregnant in real life since she is pregnant on the show. New idea in the last episode for the cliff hanger. This shows grows on most people till they get addicted.
B004YVAD6M,gary blakely,3,I will miss the show last season on now ...but quality of this download is sketchy at best .....digitally breaks up several times during each episode
B004YVAD6M,Gary W. Crane "Movie Lover",5,I like this TV series which nowadays may not last too long for reasons I can only guess at. I have the other seasons and just want to complete my collection. If you haven't seen any of the shows try season 1 and see what you think of it.
B004YVAD6M,George B. Lane,4,Most of the episodes are well-done and the plot lines are interesting. The interplay among the principal characters is great and the writing is superb.
B004YVAD6M,J. Donaldson "Cal-diver",3,Sorry to see this series came to an end. We enjoyed the characters and the situations. It was a good premise for a series.
B004YVAD6M,Jen Sites,5,I've loved this show since day one. This show always kept you on the edge of your seat and keeps your attention. I love Mary and Marshall they work so well together.
B004YVAD6M,justnora,5,I was so disappointed when the show was cancelled. I love the show and all the characters. I hope they bring them back one of these days. The cast was great and storylines very interesting. Miss it immensely!
B004YVAD6M,Nedra Ann Schott,5,I loved all the seasons and hope it comes back again -  maybe after the baby is a little older.
B004YVAD6M,Richard "Dickie",5,Show is good. It was better when the music was original. The "new age" stuff takes  the edge off. Feels like a soap opera.
B004YVAD6M,Sandra L. Cassidy,5,Never watched this show before I bought the series..I love it! Very funny & entertaining. Leave you wanting for more. Laugh out loud funny
B004YVAD6M,Sandra Sneed,5,I enjoyed watching the 4th season of In Plain Sight. This was a very funny and entertaining season. Always makes me laugh.
B004YVAD6M,sewready,5,This series should still be on but it ended. Don't miss it though. Interesting plot and great characters.  Loved it.
B004Z4QUB0,D,5,I never knew how a lot of the states go their shapes. I like how it touches on issues that are relevant tody.
B004Z4QUB0,E. Yeager,5,These shows should be checked for absolute accuracy and then shown as part of a social studies or history course in high school.
B004Z4QUB0,Freda "student artist",5,Learning history that is new to me.  Will be watching more of this series.  Insightful and entertaining.  Happy that the shows are offered on Amazon Prime.
B004Z4QUB0,Joan,5,This is a great show.  I learn something every time I watch it.  Hope it continues with other facts about the states.
B004Z4QUB0,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",5,The historic info supplied by an interesting/funny host makes this show a hit for me.  I love this show and could watch information about this country I didn't know for a long time.
B004Z4QUB0,Nan,5,We have just started watching this. Love it and recommend it to learn about your country. Very interesting and informative.
B004Z4QUB0,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,i enjoy watching this series because it adds to my trivia file.  it's informative and funny and I really enjoy the host.  Brian is a very funny guy.  People respond to him very positively and he just makes the show.  Maybe you can do another show on how the countys got their shape or how cities got their shape or something like that.  The sound and picture quality is excellent.
B004Z4QUB0,WirebitersDotCom,5,This is one of the few History channel shows that actually discusses history. It's generally filled with interesting trivia. Highly recommended.
B004ZISVRW,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",3,Movie kept me enthralled throughout.  Poor grade of graphics grainy to watch.  Special affects were pretty good.  Just wish quality of the picture was better.
B004ZISVRW,bbrockRailFan "Brian Brocksmith",5,It inst a classic but I enjoyed it. I thought it was unique and worth the fare price. I recommend it. Its a sleeper hit.
B004ZISVRW,Christ's Soldier,5,THis film you can tell *spoiler alert* is not real but it's awesome the way they made haha to seem as if it is real. This reminded me of the blair witch project only better. The troll hunter guy was so cool after he lightened up. Totally recommend and 5 stars.
B004ZISVRW,Ron Baker,4,The Norwegian legend of trolls is cleverly uncovered in this modern mock documentary. The special effects that create the trolls are very well done. The monsters are otherworldly and bizarre. A ton of fun to watch.
B004ZISVRW,toadknocker,1,I watched this movie based on the four and a half stars...  The reviewers must have all been Norwegian family members of the film maker.  This plot is so tired and the effects were so bad give me a break.  No one on a film shot can figure out how to use night vision at night??  It's just stupid...the movie is stupid...and I feel stupid for wasting my time watching it...
B004ZISVRW,White Raven "zxy",5,I loved this film for its quirky originality.  Just need to add that if you did like this film you might also want to check out "Norwegian Ninja".
B004ZWHXEK,Catherine,4,I am never disappointed with anything animal planet makes or offers. Educational-I learned a lot. At the same time entertaining
B00502A47C,David R. Criser,5,I enjoyed this account of the P40's action in ww2 as much as I could say I &#34;enjoyed&#34; any historical account of the war. Thoseace fighter pilots certainly have my respect and admiration. Every American citizen should be aware of this chapter of the warand the brave members of the flying tigers.
B00502A47C,Honey Solomon,4,The interviews with both American and Japanese pilots are well presented and allow one a better understand of the Japanese prespective. The original footage is interesting even though not all footage was from the area of focus (read credits). This is one of the better done documentaries of it's kind. It is not intended as an in depth study of strategy and tactics.  Well suited for beginners and those who would like an overview of WWII air power. Definitely a good starting point.
B0050WFI2S,Amazon Customer,4,This is a good series about how stuff is made. If you start in season 3 you get to see the episodes free if you have Prime.
B0050WFI2S,Amazon Customer,5,This is a really great series telling or explaining in some depth about different things in and about our modern life. Think that should be 20 words
B0050WFI2S,Cathy Hale,5,It's really good!  I like it!  It's a learning experience you know. Stuff you never thought about and how it came about
B0050WFI2S,ChrisJ,5,Only Modern Marvels does this good of a job at making something as mundane as dirt entertaining and educational at the same time.  Highly recommended.
B0050WFI2S,Cynthia Robutka,4,most of the episodes are interesting. good informative and interesting show.great addition to prime only wish more seasons were included in prime. we cut the cable and rely on prime for tv viewing.
B0050WFI2S,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,Family enjoyed watching this season 3 of Modern Marvels. This season gives you in-depth coverage of current products that we take for granted in this modern world we live in and opens your eyes how these products are made in a sustainable manner for the ever growing world population. Spoiler alert: Learning how certain products are made might make you think twice before you consume them :)Hope Amazon works out a deal and makes all other seasons made available to Amazon Prime Members soon. Five Stars!
B0050WFI2S,S. CONRAD,5,I choose this 5 star rating because you can learn so much how thing are made. I would recommend this to everyone.
B0051HIK04,CEPeters,5,Just the cutest videos.  My daughter and I both enjoy watching Olivia together.  We are BIG fans of hers.  There's always a life lesson simple enough for the little ones.  They are well done!
B0051HIK04,Cindy Flowers,5,Of all the shows my 2 and 3 year old watch this is one of the ones my husband and I actually find entertaining as well.
B0051OWS2I,BHoward,5,Real accounts of survival.  We need more seasons of this immediately.  Def worth the watch (my husband even watched it and he doesn't like &#34;these kind of shows&#34;)
B0051OWS2I,Diana Strole,3,The stories are good but I don't care for the way it jumps back and forth from one person to the next.  I would rather see one complete story before moving on to the next
B0051OWS2I,george lopez,3,These stories are told by the victims themselves which makes the show more believable and very unnerving. Definitely worth watching!
B0051OWS2I,JCook,5,Most of the stories are intense and many are amazing. It is unreal what the human spirit and body can endure when necessary.
B0051OWS2I,Jeni,5,this show is 100% real. it's simple yet direct and emotional. I love how much courage these people have to tell us their stories of surviving what life has thrown at them.
B0051OWS2I,Toby De La Pena,5,I really enjoyed watching all the episodes of &#34;I Survived&#34; and I hope to order complete seasons. I will be seeing season 5 next!
B0051QREPW,Dorothy,5,Except for Thomas and Sarah this is definitely one of my favorites.  Never boring.  Very good shows. The actors are pros.
B0051QREPW,Luv2learn "Sandy P",5,Wasn't sure how this would translate into modern entertainment in a time of instant viewing through our new technology but the story quickly compels you to watch.  Perfect reflection of the setting and period. Unafraid to tackle various issues that were not seen in mainstream viewing in the 1970's.  I have thoroughly enjoyed these characters and experiencing their stories.
B0051QREPW,Patricia A. Jones "Bookworm",5,I have enjoyed learning about the privileged in England and how their lives contrasted so much with the downstairs  where their servants lived and worked for very little reward.  The rigid rules of society dictated how both groups behaved and interacted with each other.
B00524HBY2,Amazon Customer,5,This is an amusing series with enough who don it to make it interesting.  We find it a delightful light show to watch at the end of the day
B00524HBY2,Ann M. Hoffman,5,Had all the bells and whistles for a good series. The actors and actress were well matched for the program. The acting was premium.
B00524HBY2,carla cribb,5,This show my husband and I like and can watch together. We have different taste in shows but this one has it all so we both enjoy it together.
B00524HBY2,Carolyn Skinner08,4,I like the people and the story I miss florida so good to see ti again.Good looking guy too
B00524HBY2,C. Groetzinger "noregroetz",5,Glades was a great show. It is a real shame that they ended the show with a major cliff hanger. Shame on that network! Why do they cancel good programs and keep the trash?
B00524HBY2,charlie t. hodges,5,now you are getting things right this show is worth watching if you have more like this show I will stay with amazon for a long time.
B00524HBY2,Christine A. Rushbrook,5,This is a very good detective series about a quirky guy who comes from Chicago to florida to get away from something.
B00524HBY2,CO GIRL,4,I enjoy this show so much.  It's a lot of fun and I'll continue to watch all the seasons that are available.
B00524HBY2,Elaine Woodford,5,I liked the story between the major characters. Plus this 78 yr old Grandma enjoyed seeing the handsome main character. Enjoyed the humor of the show as well.
B00524HBY2,flyfish,5,Each show is a separate show with litely coupled chacters that  makes it enjoyable to watch. Does not overly rely on violence for the plot to unfold.  Enjoyable sense of humor is exhibited by the characters.  Love interest between cop and forensic nurse keeps you wondering what will happen...Overall a very enjoyable show to look forward to..without making a major intellectual committment...
B00524HBY2,Inky,3,This series started out promising but seasons 2 has too many unbelievable turns with the relationships. It just doesn't work for me. I'll finish watching this season but I don't think I'll go on to season 3.
B00524HBY2,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,This is among my list of favorite shows.  I really appreciate Amazon providing it on Prime.  I would say if you like a good clean mystery show give this a try.
B00524HBY2,Nursesarah001,5,This is still one of my favorites.  This is a show I can watch over and over.  I love well written shows that have the perfect amount of humor.  This is one you cannot go wrong with!
B00524HBY2,Page 2,5,I really liked the actors and the story line. No curse words or real violence I am sorry they are not continuing it. That makes me sad because it was so good.
B00524HBY2,Phyllis DeSio,5,Glades Season 1 was awesome and season 2 was just as good as the first season.. Just rec'd season we just love seeing what will happen next season in SEason 3
B00524HBY2,Rene L. Hogan "R.L.Hogan",5,It is an entertaining tv program. Reality built into the story line without having to make it an &#34;R&#34; rating.
B00524HBY2,Rock Fossil "wacowayne",4,Like the story line and most of the acting. The lead roles usually make the program very believible. Needs a new story line.
B00524HBY2,Sonja Reid,5,We enjoy the mystery story lines with a Florida flavor.  The location allows for some interesting plots.  The characters blend well and make the stories believable.
B00524HBY2,Susan Crow,5,These are great shows.  Every episode holds my attention from beginning to end.  I would recommend these shows to anyone who enjoys detective shows.
B00524HBY2,Thea "Urbana",5,I found it very fun to watch some good humor in it.  The main characters made me giggle.  I was definitely ready to watch season three.
B0053XHZIO,Blanda Lynam,5,This show is so interesting.  Love the fact that the two guys go anywhere and get into everything to fine their special piece.  Often wonder if their show is causing people to ask more when they see what the pickers will try and get for the items.
B0053XHZIO,Cortney Yonker,5,I love this show. looking forward to more seasons. There weren't any dislikes. I love how funny and entertaining they are.
B0053XHZIO,Diatom,5,A continuation of the great programs from Volumes 1 and 2. There is a nice tongue and cheek relationship between the characters. It's amazing how far the pickers go from their home base- they go throughout the continental U. S. A nice family show.
B0053XHZIO,Greg,3,Good show. I hate scripted shows that portray reality. Would have got more stars if it didn't seem so fake.
B0053XHZIO,greg,5,I find that we all have allittle bit of picker in us. This also helps us learn the value of things we may think worthless.
B0053XHZIO,HeMeGrrrr,5,Love learning about rusted gold. Interesting on what people collect & how the boys think outside of the box to create a new use for an old item.
B0053XHZIO,jatnj "Janet",5,Their love for history and the stories behind the items they pick is infectious.  It makes me wish I had paid better attention to the items in my grandmother's and great aunt's homes.
B0053XHZIO,Lawrence Rivett Jr. "Elvis Mercury",4,Entertaining show as you watch them look for items to resell.  Humorous banter between the two guys and their office manager.
B0053XHZIO,Lurch,4,A very fun show I love the hosts and the show it self.  I wish it wasn't so scripted but it is still fun and you will learn a lot.  Learn what people have collected over a life time and enjoy meeting new characters that are out in our world.  You will have a great time.
B0053XHZIO,P. Manley "book lover",5,I love this show and this season is as good as the others which is pretty great.  Worth watching!  Great season.
B0053XHZIO,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,I LOVE IT!!! I USED TO HAVE DISH TV...BUT GOT TOO  MUCH $$$$$ HAD TO DROP IT....SO WHEN I SAW AMAZON PRIME ON MY KINDLE I SNATCHED IT UP!!!
B0053XHZIO,Sadie,5,Love this show and the enthusiasm the guys show. We have been all over the country antiquing and enjoy this program.
B0053XHZIO,Victor1896 "movie addict",5,I really enjoy this show.  The history on the stuff they find.  But I really like Danna and how she inter-acts with the guys.  I just watch the show where they are going to be opening a new store in Memphis.  show be interesting
B0053ZU4P8,charity,2,The concept of this show is good. The people in this show are not. It seems to me like they blame all of these &#34;hauntings&#34; on objects that would look cool in their museum.'I believe this object is the reason why your home is haunted. What would you like to do? I can take it to my museum for you and rid you of the haunting.'Tools.
B0054IAZYE,Felina,5,We've watched this since season one.  It's exciting and head scratching.  I can't imagine driving on ice and snow for hundreds of miles carrying huge loads.  Incredible !
B0054IAZYE,Gaff,5,Enjoyed it very much. Just goes to show you how dangerous that kind of driving conditions can be and the type of stamina one must have to work long hours and rough conditions. Give it a try.
B0054IAZYE,juan,5,Washing these driver put their life on the line is a rush of adrenaline in your body.  I enjoy these series because few people dare to do this.
B0054TK99E,Amazon Customer,5,This is the best series on television now.  I love the special effects and the story line.  I hope this series lasts many seasons.
B0054TK99E,Amazon Customer "Home Daddy",4,Not your MJFox vehicle.  This is a very fun teen show the first season.  Effects are way better than expected.  Well done MTV.Shocking that I enjoyed it as much as i did.  Little teen angsty at times but hey...MTVWell done series.
B0054TK99E,artsieann,4,I thought I wouldn't like it but I really enjoyed watching. It started good and ended well. I think most young people would love it
B0054TK99E,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",4,Very good series I am so happy I tried one episode and have had to come back to watch the next and next and next one.  Still have a lot of them to go.  This is a have to see program.
B0054TK99E,Chinabug "chinabug",5,Ran across this little gem completely by accident.  Watched the first episode and was hooked-so much so I purchased the entire season based on seeing one episode.  I am very happy it has been granted a second season.  Can't wait for this to come out on dvd as well.
B0054TK99E,EZELLA001,5,Hunky Werewolves and other scary creatures that scare the bejesus out of you. It's a must see if you like supernatural shows and lots of action.
B0054TK99E,JLH4,4,I'm an original 80s guy and grew up with the old. Now with children my daughter and I watch this together.  It's not the movie. The show is very well written and the characters can grow.  The FX are very well done.  Tastefully not grotesque.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural story lines.
B0054TK99E,Laura,3,I watched this show with my husband for a while.He watched more than I did and thought it was okay for pre teens but just too silly for most adults.I guess if we were eleven or so we would have enjoyed it.
B0054TK99E,loveinthemist,3,i like the first season okay.  not so the 2nd
B0054TK99E,Mary E. Henry "Sci-fi fan",4,Teen Wolf season 1 is great. I would have liked more episodes. It is a great imaginative show. Teen agers are always getting into trouble. Worth watching.
B0054TK99E,MickeyT "MickeyT",5,I have watched this series on and off for a while and thought it was time to fill in the gaps by seeing all of them in sequence and I am really glad I did. It all now makes sense and now I also have this really hot cast on DVD to watch any time I want! HOT GUYS and pretty girls in the cast and well written and acted.
B0054TK99E,oldladywithbcs,5,NOT just a teen's movie.  I haven't been a teen for a very long time but loved this show. Tyler Posey will be a star worth keeping an eye on in years to come.  Wonderful performances by all.  Would recommend this series to anyone !
B0054TK99E,Paula,4,Enjoyed the starting season. Was well made which made it interesting. Good plot and actors.Not much not to like it.
B0054TK99E,Robert Becker,5,I hope they make a season 4!!  This is one of the best shows!!  It really keeps you in suspense!  I actually watched the whole Season 3 (which  I think is there best season) all in one sitting!!  WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!
B0054TK99E,Texas Gal "catlady1981",5,Show was recommended on a blog I was reading about Lost Girl. People were complaining that the quality of the writing had declined with each passing season. Someone commented that the writing only got better with this show so I decided to take a look. I'm enjoying the show quite a bit. Comedic moments are causing a few chuckles and the story line is engaging.
B0054U565U,Amazon Customer "chemming",5,Enjoy action and intrigue? Get it here. Light encounters and confrontations with magical solutions. Fun for all. 3 more words.
B0054U565U,A. M. Bonito,5,Definitely worth watching this series. I love Piper Perabo and the other characters that she plays with. I recommend this to new viewers.
B0054U565U,Amorette,5,Good entertainment.  I love the episodes.  Definitely worth my time to watch Covert Affairs.  I like variety and it has plenty of different stories.
B0054U565U,B. Lyn,4,The series continues to be unbelievable but yet enjoyable. There are a lot of characters but they work well together.
B0054U565U,CAR GUY,5,Watchable series that entertains and is believable.  Like the idea of Washington being the &#34;home base&#34; of the series as we lived in that area.  Entertaining but not a lot of blood & guts.
B0054U565U,David Wright,4,I do not get the USA chnnnel but I am glad that I have my roku box and can get the amazon channel and I am able to buy episodes of this show. Good to watch.
B0054U565U,dragonflylady,5,I started watching this and fell in love with it. It is exciting to watch. There is action and romance in it as well.
B0054U565U,D. Robertson,5,It nice to see a spy drama that doesn't feature the infallible James Bond type character in the staring role.  Lots of action and somewhat believable
B0054U565U,Golly,4,The first season was good and the quality of the second season has held. Looking forward to seeing if the third season measures up to the first two
B0054U565U,H2oxy,5,Each episode is very well done.  The characters are fleshed out and you feel like you know them.  Fun series.
B0054U565U,J. Ligon "JimL",4,Our spy breaks cover and has some different action this season which pulled me in to the story.Good series and am looking forward to the next seasons shows.
B0054U565U,Kristin L. Weiner,4,Love the characters and storyline.  Very entertaining. Similar to the show Alias. I look forward to catching up on more episodes.
B0054U565U,Martin Allain,4,This is an enjoyable series. I love seeing a young female having such strength. There was a time in the recent past that such ability in a woman was seldom if ever in Media.
B0054U565U,Mary "Mary",5,I do like this show.  It surprised me how entertaining it was.  There is enough element of surprise in it to keep you watching.
B0054U565U,MokaChik,4,This is light weight entertainment.Characters stay consistent through all four seasons.I often leave TV on while working and this is perfect for that.
B0054U565U,Richard "Fun_to_know",3,Some of the sequence themes are repetitive from season one and so that makes them predictable but the show remains entertaining.
B0054U565U,RJK,5,This is a great program and series which keeps you on the edge of you seat at all times. I highly recommend it.
B0054U565U,R. Roberts,4,Good show lots of action good stories. Excellent High definition. I would highly recommend. The story revolves around a female CIA operative and her blind handler.
B0054U565U,S. Cowan,5,We really enjoyed watching Covert Affairs. We can't wait for the coming seasons to be released. We'll definitely buy them too.
B0054U565U,S. Marsh,5,Really enjoy this show. I usually watch two or three shows one after the other. It's like eating peanuts! Lots of fun!
B0054U565U,SureBob,5,Season 2 is better and more exciting than Season 1.  Annie has matured in her role as well as the script.  Auggie shows more versatility as well as the other characters.  Cast is well done.
B0054U565U,Virginia F. Eastwood "ginny",4,I love spy shows but I also like a little fun in the characters. I would recommend this show highly!
B005544TRQ,Aaron Sewell,5,This show has a great cast and thought provoking plots. Even for us non-lawyer people its a blast and a half.
B005544TRQ,Adam Barrett,5,Suits is a great comedy about lawyers in NY. It is fast paced and witty. Kind if like Gilmore Girls for lawyers.
B005544TRQ,Amazon Customer "Grumpy",5,This show is smart and addictive. The story lines are spot-on and the acting is so believable. Each episode is well written and the actors bring their A-Game to each scene.
B005544TRQ,Amazon Customer "Hooked",5,This is the season that started it all for me. Suits is one of the best shows as far as I 'm concerned that is on USA now. Watch it and I am sure you will agree.
B005544TRQ,Anon "Anon",5,Hooked. You can watch these episodes over and over and still catch new parts of the witty dialogue. And Harvey. Yum.
B005544TRQ,Beverly Johnson,4,Interesting premise ....acted out by convincing characters. I thoroughly enjoy it.It is highly enjoyable with laugh out loud moments.
B005544TRQ,Brandonia,5,I started watching because season 3 just started on TV and I wanted a new show to watch and I was hooked after the first episode! I watched the entire season in 3 days.
B005544TRQ,Brian,5,The casting in this show is great. Each character is unique and each gives you a different insight into the Law
B005544TRQ,B. Smith,5,This series is one of the best series I've seen and I've been watching TV since the Lone Ranger back in the 50's. Clever writers make sure that every episode has an interesting twist. Kudos to the writers and applause to the interesting cast of characters.
B005544TRQ,Carl Gillberg &#34;Kamaka&#34; "Carl Gillberg",5,Suits highlights the clever nature of high end attorneys and their devil may care attitude. The main two main characters yield and wheel a shared Jurist Doctorate at clients spraying collaterally damage in the process of winning at all costs.  Billable hours never seem to be portrayed as they are in real life but the acting and the writing place this show heads and tails above most.  This one gives Netflix's House of Cards a run for it's money.
B005544TRQ,cindy gooch,5,I love this show. It's funny and interesting and not boring. It's different than any other show out there. I would recommend this show.
B005544TRQ,Citizen John,4,Everything about this series is implausible.  A lawyer that wins every time by pulling a stunt at the last second.  A protege that is smarter than any human yet needs his mentor and otherwise wouldn't fit into society.  A sexy paralegal that always looks great and is never actually available.The acting is great - first rate.The bad thing is the show transmits the notion that one gets ahead by making up clever lies on the spot.
B005544TRQ,Craig Miller,4,Well written with many surprises...Actors do a great job with their parts. Enjoy watching  with my family during the weekends.
B005544TRQ,Cynthia,4,We are enjoying the story line and the character development of this series (which we almost stopped watching after the pilot). We especially like Gina Torres' character and the way that she is coming more to the front of the story line. It is going to be hard to complete season 3 and have to wait for fall.
B005544TRQ,David,4,Good show - worth watching - sometimes a little over the top but if you can accept this it's fun to watch - a lot better than most of the shows on tv
B005544TRQ,Debra L. Jensen,2,I watched about 30  minutes and realized it's not for me.  It is a good show but it's on the line of White Collar.  Their good but the acting is fair and the writing is C+.
B005544TRQ,Dennis Charpentier,4,I enjoy the main storyline in each episode along with the continuing back stories. If you like lawyering shows with serious character development...Suits is for you.
B005544TRQ,Diane Sanford,2,This was not my favorite.  Too much fowl language and degrading others.
B005544TRQ,D. Walters "Florida Boy",4,Only saw the pilot so far but really enjoyed it and intend to watch more. Hope it stays as good as the pilot.
B005544TRQ,Edward Vanzo,3,Acting is excellent - script lacks refinement - too tacky. Very low on the of list I want to watch.
B005544TRQ,Elizabeth Ansley,5,Since I don't get HBO never heard of this series but love the characters and the plot and Gabriel Macht
B005544TRQ,EMSDAVE,5,&#34;Your hard work really shined through.  It's obvious you've been at this a long time.&#34;Love to audition !!!!!!!!!!David Colorado
B005544TRQ,Ferd J Ferrell,5,Pretty good entertainment ....The characters really grown on you...Highly recommended ...real life situations as far as the politics of doing any business...
B005544TRQ,finley,5,Suits has it al! There is drama and romance. You have comedy and sadness. I was addicted from the first show.
B005544TRQ,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Acting great!!!  Story fascinating!!  We looked forward to watching every epidsode! Love all the characters in this outstanding series.  Highly recommend!
B005544TRQ,greg,5,I like the idea but the arigants is harf to take. It's like a small tooth ack that you can't leave alone.
B005544TRQ,Jadeda "grma_p",1,I did not appreciate the language. right from the start they were taking the Lord's name in every sentence it seemed. We might have watch maybe 5 minutes of it. That was more than we cared for!
B005544TRQ,Jane Smith "Jane Smith",5,Excellent storyline and exceptional acting. This series is as good as The Good Wife. I look forward to seeing more episodes.
B005544TRQ,Jannieknows "Jannie",5,This show is quite unique and very different. This is the type of show that is interesting on many levels.  You get to like the charaters right away-and want to know more and more about them. The stories are thought-provoking and the BEST PART are the Easy to look at stars! There is one man that is so easy to dislike...he plays his part well.  5 star rating.  Check it out ladies!  You will want to stay up to watch the next episode...trust me.
B005544TRQ,Jason McNees,5,I watched this show because I loved Burn Notice.  Suits is actually Much better than I thought it would be.
B005544TRQ,J. B. Miller,3,Wow what some egos in this.  New levels which I've never really seen before.  The plot line is pretty good & is fun to watch.
B005544TRQ,John Cayton "Karuna",3,Good premise. gets old and goes nowhere. good stories but very predictable. watched about five or six episodes before figuring out that each episode is pretty much a one-off.
B005544TRQ,John Crites,5,Great series! My wife and I are loving every moment of the show!
B005544TRQ,Jordan,5,Welcome to the world of Harvey Spector and Mike Ross!! This is one of the best series I have ever watched!! Rachel Zain is so hot!!
B005544TRQ,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,WOW WHAT A TV SPECTACULAR.  GABRIEL IS THE SEXIEST MAN ON EARTH.  I WILL BUY THE NEXT SEASON.  DO NOT EVEN THINK OF CANCELLING THIS TV SERIES.  ALL OF THE CAST ARE SUPERIOR.  THE STORY LINE IS FAST AND GREAT.  THE MUSIC IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.  THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO WRITE ABOUT THIS  SERIES.
B005544TRQ,jpwhel,5,I love this show. Watched the 1st year in one setting. Some quirky characters and great story lines. One of the best shows around.
B005544TRQ,Judith Ramsey,5,I cold not get enough of this show. It is well written and the actors capture your attention and keep it through each episode. Can't wait for Season 4
B005544TRQ,Kari Hampton,5,This is by far my favorite drama show bc it is mixed with plenty of comedy too without trying too hard.  A great show that both my husband and I are happy to agree to watch!
B005544TRQ,K. Oliver,5,Very engaging. Makes me want to become a lawyer. Intelligent writing many twists and turns. Each character is very three dimensional. I want more!
B005544TRQ,Lamp base bracket,5,It's very interesting with a plot line that is paralleled with other shows.  The lead role actors were well chosen and carry their parts flawlessly.
B005544TRQ,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",5,I enjoyed this series a lot.  My brother lived in New York City for 25 years and I visited there about 80 times.  The characters in this series reminded me of my brother's life while living there.  The city scenes are very accurate and depicted people in a realistic way.
B005544TRQ,Lauren,5,This is a great show!  Love the dynamics of the two main characters and their &#34;secret&#34; is a great premise.  Really enjoying it.
B005544TRQ,LG Henrichs,4,I love the fact that is so smart doesn't have to have a degree to do a job and save lives
B005544TRQ,L. Jones,5,Tired of all the depressing stuff.  This was a refreshing change.TV needs less of the gore and more of fun and good over evil.
B005544TRQ,Lynn,5,Suits is one of the best shows on T.V. It's funny and the suspense of what is going to happen next keeps me interested!
B005544TRQ,Michael D. Rose,5,I love this show!!' The actors are spectacular. You could do away with the profanity and sex scenes!!! The show is great!!!
B005544TRQ,Michael Duffy,5,Unique and original series.  the cast is excellent and the writing worthy of an award.  hooked after the first two episodes!
B005544TRQ,Michael F. Louis "MFL",5,Patrick does a great job of acting the part and one feels as though one is in the scene.  The backbiting and baiting leaves one wondering if that goes on in the big law firms.
B005544TRQ,Michele Pankiw,1,It started off ok and then it became silly and predictable so my husband I decided not to continue watching it.  The acting was ok but the story line well you can figure it out right away.
B005544TRQ,Miki Turtsanyi,5,The connection between the two main characters is outstandingly entertaining. Well written and delivered. This show makes me want to be an attorney.
B005544TRQ,M Parker,4,This is a really intense series. Lots of controversy and egos among the characters. Many perplexing complex problems to solve.
B005544TRQ,Nat,5,This is a great watch. The first show had me hooked. The story lines are really interesting and keeps moving. If I ever needed legal advice I sure wish my lawyers looked like them!
B005544TRQ,nocnotes2day,5,An interesting series with not so ordinary but down to earth persons playing the corporate real life and legal politics and drama games that competitive jobs often drown us into.  I like that most episodes don't depend on the next...I can watch any episode and get a complete show with whatever ending and not have to wait for next show.
B005544TRQ,Patricia Savage,5,I love Harvey!  then Donna then Mike then Rachel then Louis then Jessica.  What an entertaining show.  No one better even THINK of cancelling this show...or I'll sic Harvey on them!
B005544TRQ,Penny Palmer "la petite chef",5,Gabriel Macht is amazing in this series. And I've been a Gina Torres fan since her Firefly days. Stories are wonderful.
B005544TRQ,Ralph,5,Discovered Suits on Amazon Prime. Now I seem unable to go to bed without watching at least one episode. Really like the sparky and sharp conversations and relationships. I recommend to family and friends.
B005544TRQ,Raymond J. Brunner,4,I love the realistic drama that is on this show. It keeps you interested in the show as it moves along.
B005544TRQ,R. H. Newmark "BobN",5,I like the quick tempo of the writing and the &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; humor. I am not sure how accurate some of the legal jargon is but I am not watching it as a tutorial and as entertainment it is definitely 5 stars.
B005544TRQ,rich daniels,5,In the era of stupid reality shows and boring movies Suits is a breath of fresh air!!! It's smart witty & funny with a lot of modern drama and pretty ladies thrown in as well!!!  Well worth the time to watch it USA hit the ball out of the park with Suits & Necessary Roughness!!!!
B005544TRQ,S. Lee "waterwoman39",4,The pace is hyper and the on going attention to integrity keeps me paying attention.  How can this possibly work out when the basis of employment is a lie.The pace is good and you care about these people.  It's better than it's commercials led me to believe.
B005544TRQ,Sue Boyle "blue9244",5,I love this series and I'm so glad now that I don't have TV that I can go back on Amazon Prime and watch all the wonderful series that I missed on cable.  This is very well written and acted and I am now part way through the second season.
B005544TRQ,SuperDad "SuperDad",5,I am surprised at how much I have liked this show. The premise is a bit far fetched but if you can get over the initial lies it has been a fun show to watch. It can be a bit predictable but they pull out some surprises along the way to throw you. Can't wait to see where season two goes.
B005544TRQ,Susan Crow,5,I love this show.  It holds my interest from the first minute.  I have watched both seasons 1 and 2 and am trying to convince myself that I should not buy season 3.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B005544TRQ,swims2me,4,I enjoyed this show. Maybe I was just surprised that lawyers could be entertaining. Likening the cast was. Plus too.
B005544TRQ,TaydeeBee,5,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time! Great story line! Something I've never seen before. Love it!
B005544TRQ,Teresa P.,5,My son got me hooked to this series. It looked like another spoiled lawyers show but it sucks you in and then your hooked to all the characters. I like how it gets you to cheer for the good doers and hate the bad eggs.
B005544TRQ,Tom,5,This show demonstrates how much drama can be had in people's lives. It's all a game and love takes a back seat to being tough and greedy. Lovely role models for us all.
B005544TRQ,Tumbleweed,5,Very good series. A little too far fetched at times but it makes a good story. Enjoy the banter between the two stars.
B005544TRQ,zzdb,5,I really enjoy this show. It seems smart and witty. The humor is quick and relentless. Each character is well developed
B0055EQ30M,A. Thompson "marie michael gabriel raphael",5,I LOVE THIS SEASON; AM WATCHING OFTEN; I MAY MEMORIZE WHAT I AM LEARNING... GREAT PRESENTATION; THANK YOU VERY MUCH
B0055EQ30M,dennis,4,Love this TV series. It is very informational and it represents all side of the question in each of its episodes. Not any one view is put out there. Very good for people who what to know the answers to the hard questions and for the dreamers.
B0055EQ30M,Small Town Blues "jf",5,I like the science behind sci-fi and love to hear different theories so this is right down my alley. We don't have regular TV like cable or satellite so we watch Amazon Prime streaming on our PS3 and buy DVDs. Now we watch what we want when we want and don't filter a lot of crap to get to the good stuff!
B0055MQUM0,Baker,4,Each episodes investigative subject matter is unique and a departure from the norm.  I believe typical Syfy fans would find this two season series quite entertaining.
B0055MQUM0,Dangerman "Dan G.",4,David Strathairn gives this series uber credibility. All the characters are solid and believable.  Great eps and a recommended series overall.
B0055MQUM0,JV,5,I love this season when I will the next season start I can't wait to see more of it keep it coming
B0055MQUM0,Laura,5,I really enjoyed Heroes. There are similarities between the two but they are definitely different stories with different bents in the characters. My favorite is Gary who has autism and a special power. I love the way the others treat him with respect and accept his differences.
B0055MQUM0,LG Henrichs,3,Wasn't what I thought it would be. A little slow and took awhile to figure out the story line.Hope second season is better.
B0055MQUM0,Lolo,4,enjoyed the main characters and some of the flaws of the characters made them human and annoying. still fun to watch
B0055MQUM0,Lynn McBee,4,Really enjoyed this scifi series. Hope it will be as good in season 2. Hard to find well done series that can hold my attention. Better than alot of tv out there.
B0055MQUM0,Meredith Arnold,5,No super violence or stuff just for effect.  These are well told stories with solid character development and very entertaining.  The sprinkling of humor is well done and furthers the character development nicely.  Not your usual super hero fare with twisty story lines keeps it engaging and worth watching.
B0055MQUM0,Pacific Mitchell,5,If you like Sci-Fi this is a great show; starts off kind of slow but gets much better as it goes
B0055MQUM0,Prefl96,5,So glad I found this show on Amazon Prime. If you like a little supernatural mixed in with superhero this is it.
B0055MQUM0,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,This show is SO good.  We totally enjoyed it.  It centers around a team of six people with the head guy being a shrink.  They track down people with special abilities.  They call them 'Alphas'.  All of the people are alphas except for the head guy.  There is even a person on this team who is a highly functioning autisic (Gary).  Don't know who this actor is but he does a wonderful job of playing this part.  I was totally disappointed that they pulled this show after two seasons 'cause it had wonderful writers and actors.  Each episode was different and suspenseful.  Check it out.  I think you will appreciate it.  Highly recommended.
B0055MQUM0,Sammie Kaie "Sammie",4,If you are a SyFy fan you will like Alphas. It is not my favorite series but it is certainly very good. The acting is excellent and the script/plots are easy to follow. I have really enjoyed it and will watch the next series too.
B0055MQUM0,Sherry A. Mccall,4,x-men seems like the same story done with a little twist. good show overall need more try's like this on tv.
B0055MQUM0,Stephen C. Rankin,5,I can not believe this did not last at least 5 seasons. well written and a good cast. love this one.
B0055MQUM0,SusieQ "Carwalker",5,This series grows on you. I have watched the 1st season twice. The first time Ididn't know what to think. The 2nd season came out and I started to watch butfelt I had missed something in the first season. I watched the 1st season againand then marveled at the writing. I like good new idea series and this is one of them.
B0055MQUM0,Suzanne Fisher,5,Well written and the cast of actors were perfectly suited to their roles. I really enjoyed this season and the next.
B0055MQUM0,Tom,5,Good show.  Not too violent and lots of humanity and common sense themes.  Lead actor is excellent and the autistic kid is awesome.
B0055XI8BK,Big John MacK,3,I HAVE NOT YET VIEWED THIOS SERIES but I hope it will continue to surprise me the odd episode I have seen made me purchase the series to get a good feel for the series.
B0055XI8BK,Carol J. Wooldridge,5,I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THIS SHOW AND I AM  GLAD TO HAVE THE FIRST SEASON TO RE-VISIT WHENEVER I WANT.
B0055XI8BK,jj,3,I LOVE the premise behind this show. The biggest problem for me is that the lead cannot act. She gets totally flustered around the cute guy...it is just weird. But the idea behind the show is great and I really like the guy in black. That works. I am going with 3 generous stars...could have done 2.
B0056CCB9A,C. J. Vazquez,1,This show is complete nonsense. Children should not be treated in this manner. This is a poorly produced reality show.
B0056CCB9A,Greg,5,this show is pretty outstanding when it comes to beauty pageants. though some of the kids are small prima donna they still do a pretty good job of wowing the judges. I think this is a great show.
B0056CCB9A,Ma'am "Ma'am",4,Call me shallow but I like babies.  I like to see crazy moms and grand moms .  This is very light watching.  No Anthony Trolllope but a fun bit of semi child abuse with moms sticking eyelashes and hairpieces on little girls who sometimes rebell by behaving badly.  These children usually perform ala STEPFORD WIVES and make Mommy proud to spend thousands of dollars to win a crown and sash that are too big and tacky.  Enjoy
B0056CCB9A,Mary paushel,5,I now own seasons 1-4.  As many seasons that are put out I will buy it.  Quality is excellent. Very pleased.
B0056RKA1G,Christine,3,This is one of those programs I watch when I can't sleep. It fills the time and ghost stories are always fun.
B0056RKA1G,JCruea10,3,I like ghost/paranormal shows so I decided to see what this was about.  Its alright.  But there aren't moments like in other shows that scare me!  But still an alright show.
B0056RKA1G,Jimmy Don Johnson,5,This is a collection of some of the most fascinating stories ever.  Some of the celebrities interviewed were people that I would have never dreamed had a paranormal experience.  I found this to be a really good watch!
B0056RKA1G,readinglarge,5,Better than those other paranormal shows and you get to see and listen to your favorite celebrities tell their stories.so much more personal and way more fun to watch!!
B0056RKA1G,scooty,5,I hope to see more and more episodes of celebrity ghost stories in the future. It goes to show even famous people witness the unexplained and the paranormal!
B0056RKA1G,Steve Talamantes,3,This is an interesting show. I like shows that deal with the paranormal and hearing these kinds of stories from celebrities is neat. Ive heard of or seen most of the celebrities featured on the show.
B0056RKA1G,Tech Ed "Tech Ed",3,This program is similar to &#34;My Ghost Story&#34; except for the following: the stories are presented by celebrities and the sightings are reenactments--no video or audio recordings of the apparitions are presented. But like &#34;My Ghost Story&#34; I find the histories of the locations of the sightings and the people who lived there much more interesting.
B005749LXQ,Cathy "Kindle Kreature",5,I liked the addition of the newest mermaid.  Missed the young man who got the scholarship.  The series ended on a positive note with closure and enough side story lines for further spin offs.
B005749LXQ,C. Pratt,5,Despite being a generation past the appropriate age for this show I found it a lot of fun.  I've watched all three seasons. A neat little bit of science fantasy that makes for enjoyable "suspend reality" entertainment.
B005749LXQ,K.V.,5,This series my daughter loved. She can't wait until season 4. The shows are clean and I don't have to monitor the content. Thanks again.
B005749LXQ,L. Michael Gundy,5,good family show seen by 250 million people for each show at it peak.  just look at what the actresses are doing now: Phoebe tonklin in the originals with Clair holt.  both were also in vampire diaries.
B005749LXQ,@margaret,5,I watched all three seasons and enjoyed all three. I like my Amazon prime membership because it allows me to watch series free and I watch them at my convenience . I always know where I stopped at.
B005749LXQ,murthom1,5,She just can't wait to sit down and watch the latest episode on Kindle Fire. She thinks the relationships between the mermaids and the boys are amusing as well as complex. A nice touch for an age appropriate show.
B005749LXQ,Pamala Pickard,5,I love the underwater scenes.  They make beautiful mermaids. They solve problems that young people have but it's for everyone.
B00574P75M,Elizabeth Marshall "Elizabeth Marshall",5,I know that hoarders are suffering from a mental illness and I can't imagine how awful it must be.  My guilty secret is I feel better about my house cleaning after watching Hoarders.  May not be nice but it is what it is.
B00574P75M,Gina,5,The show is well done. The featured stories give background without going overboard. It's just hard to watch! Definitely make you to clean out your closets.
B00574P75M,Jacob Crampton,4,This show makes you think how many people are living next door to a hoarder and have no idea. Shows extreme cases and the steps taken to try and fix the situation.
B00574P75M,Linda Pawson,5,I watch Hoarders on tv but have missed several episodes.  It was really nice to be able to watch Hoarders through the Amazon site.Especially without any commercials!  The program was clear and I had no difficulty watching it.  Would highly recommend usingAmazon Prime.
B00574P75M,Lorri Robinson,4,If you know what hoarding is...this is it at its worst.  I like that they provide aftercare and therapy. I
B00574P75M,Lydia Buitron,5,Great heartfelt stories mixed with all the dysfunctional family drama that comes from Americas heartlands. If you can stomach such realness. Because it's Real. A disease.
B00574P75M,Marc W. Gilbertson,5,I can't get enough of this show.  I find it incredibly interesting to watch how the people develop as they work through their issues.
B00574P75M,Pat,5,This series as a whole is fascinating as it provides rare glimpses into the thoughts of those who hoard. Beyond the awful messes and the ruined houses are human beings in desperate pain and they self-medicate with &#34;retail therapy&#34;.
B00574P75M,Robert Bowen,4,I'm always amazed at how bad some of these houses are. It also helps me to get rid of more stuff every time I watch. Not sure I like the different start to the shows where they show some main scenes then go back to two days prior. I liked the original format.
B00574P75M,Ron Baker,5,The extent of denial this mental illness comes with is beyond comprehension. This series presents the cases well and treats the affected with respect. Hoarders is very well done.
B0057UGEUS,Jessica L Meyer,5,This show is great. I really like the characters a lot. They are very relatable and you care about what happens to them.
B0057UGEUS,Laer Carroll,1,This series seems to be primarily a romance series with a little police procedural thrown in. And romance between co-workers?  That's a situation so ripe for disaster I could not stomach the thought of enduring more.
B0057UGEUS,N. Rude,5,Great show! Really get into it!! Funny and smart and makes you really root for the characters!! I recommend to everyone!!
B0057UGEUS,Zig Meyer,5,I'm afraid I am hooked on this series.  It's got great writing with nice twists in plot.  I'm afraid it's hard to turn off!
B0057UGRGY,Jan Funk,5,Love him...making fun of life is a great way to stay sane!! Hilarious guy.!! So much is just the truth.
B0058BIL3O,C. A. Swift,5,I thing that they are better with each year.  I can't believe they have stopped creating these wonderful shows.  I will miss them.  Why is it that once something great comes along they discard it.  Great show guys.  We need more like this.
B0058BIL3O,Christina Enness "Christina Cat",5,I love this show and am so sorry that they cancelled it as soon as they did and would hope that they came out with more episodes after the fifth season ended.
B0058BIL3O,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",3,Most of the episodes in each season of Leverage have been great "sting" operations that reeled you in BUT this episode The Gold Job was filled with things that only as idiot would fall for and since it challenged my common sense this (and ONLY this) episode gets 3 Stars for the producers getting lazy.
B0058BIL3O,D. Sherman,5,The fourth year is great!  Watching this team really work together to help others makes you feel good. At least some where there is justice.  I miss  seeing BOSTON...even though they were always in Portland...I miss the beautiful shots of the waterfront and the Lenny Zachim bridge!
B0058BIL3O,Jim Phillips "Experience is what you get when...,5,As with any series by season four the show is looking for new direction.  Its no longer just the con of the week.  The characters really develop and plot lines begin to span the entire season. As expected the tech stuff is good no sound or video problems.  I was a little disappointed in the extras.  The shows all have commentary and maybe a deleted scene or two.
B0058BIL3O,L,5,One of the best episodes.  It was the first time Elliott showed he cared for Harrison.  I love this show!
B0058BIL3O,Nancy,5,Great show!  I love the way the characters have grown and developed through the seasons.  Whoever cast this show was brilliant!
B0058BIL3O,North Texas Girl,2,Leverage is getting to be a gamble to watch.  This one is slow and boring and I'm sorry I spent money on it. I hope they figure out that when people are paying per show they at least need to hold the viewer's interest.
B0058BIL3O,S. Cowan,5,Leverage is such a great series. The whole &#34;Robinhood&#34; concept works out well. I love how they show the details of how they pull off their cons.
B0058BIL3O,Tamara J. Christian,5,We love this series. We own all of them and watch them over often. It has a great cast with great chemistry.
B0058BIL3O,T. Brady "Tom",5,Oh how I wish this show was still on the air.  When it was cancelled I was so upset.  Every single character in the entire show played such a good part.  I have all 5 seasons and no way will I delete any one of them or any of the episodes.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.
B0058BIL3O,victor,5,Fun and exciting story from one episode to the next. Was sad to finish the series. Wish I could watchmore
B0058BIL3O,Victoria,5,Leverage is a fantastic show -- this episode was a bit of a departure but as wonderful as always...just really funny.
B0058SH8F4,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,this episode was yet another chapter in the Hollywood desire to make everyone agree that homosexual relationships are all roses and rainbows.  I could care less but I hate it when ANY TV show injects morals or politics into their lineup.
B00599IU22,chickypea "chickypea",3,...it is addicting. It is an unfortunate sociological study into the ramifications of poverty and the tragic situations that result.
B00599IU22,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,We love reality/ true crime dramas. This was a great series!  Always waiting for a new season of our favorites. The first 48 is a really good fast moving drama.
B00599IU22,Thanks I Needed That,5,I don't know why I find this show so interesting.  I guess it's just the idea of watching real life drama.  Very interesting show.
B00599IU22,Tom,5,Just a very good show that keeps you interested throughout as you see detectives pick up clues that leads them to suspects that often results in the guilty party being found.  Wish they had more seasons on prime than just the two....
B005C2UEL6,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,This was really good.. had issues with streaming. But is so worth the cost of paying for to watch. Great story line and did keep one s attention from start to finish!!
B005C2UEL6,D. McNamara,3,This was not too bad for an indie horror film. There is an interesting twist in the end and surprisingly decent acting from the young actors.
B005C4FD0Q,Amazon Customer,5,I'm glad to see Kate Mulgrew was added to the cast! Miss seeing her in Star Trek Voyager! I really like this bizarre series and all the weird stuff they encounter.. interesting to watch!
B005C4FD0Q,Cat in NoCal,5,I looked forward to every episode and it's wonderful to watch the episodes without those pesky commercial interruptions.  I wish more seasons were available with my Prime Membership.  I miss the warehouse gang.
B005C4FD0Q,Cynthia Middleton,5,Any fan of Warehouse 13 will not be disappointed with this years Christmas Episode. It's heart warming and funny at the same time. Reality minus Pete being born is a hoot; check out the picture of the President behind Myka's desk in her office; this sets the pace for the laughter. I highly recommend this episode.
B005C4FD0Q,Debbie Dillon,5,I don't normally care for paranormal shows but this one is pretty good. I'm on Season 3 and have enjoyed each season.
B005C4FD0Q,DENISE NAVARRO,5,Loved this show keeps you on your toes and always guessing till the end. The actors are not well known but they do a great job.
B005C4FD0Q,Diane Bevans,5,A must see for fans of the weird.  The supernatural is explained in alternate ways.  Is the best show I have seen in months.
B005C4FD0Q,DIANNA,5,IF YOU'VE NEVER WATCHED WAREHOUSE 13 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW. SEASON 3 IS AWESOME. IT HAS ZOMBIES AND IS FULL OF ACTION AND MYSTERY. IT ALSO HAS A CHRISTMAS EPISODE THAT WAS ALSO GOOD.
B005C4FD0Q,dlrespaul,5,This is a great show - - - good writing - - -interesting charactors - - - great special effects
B005C4FD0Q,D. Moore "Dano",5,This is a great fun TV show. Better then most of the trash on TV now.I got this season a Target for $19.99 A few days ago. By the time I would of pay'ed for shipping ect here on Amazon it comes out to about the same. And I get it in my hand right now.My big Bit%$ with Amazon is it's shipping. The time it now takes. When I would order a DVD months back. I would have it in about three to five days.. No big E.. The last three DVD sets got from Amazon took 9-10 days to get to me.I am still waiting for Mannix season 6 to come. Been 9 days now. Also Amazons tracking is not right.Just my two bits here.
B005C4FD0Q,E. Helms,4,Just silly sci-fi fun. Lots of campy humor and I loved the twist with H.G. Wells. All the actors seemed to fit as a team and had good chemistry.
B005C4FD0Q,Ekay,4,Love this series. Clever writing combined with well crafted acting delivers week after week of entertainment. A creative concept that's filled with fun and engaging characters.
B005C4FD0Q,Gerri Hayes "GH",5,My son loves Warehouse 13 so this is another season.  We purchase each season as it is one of his favorites tv shows. He loves to watch on his playstation 3.
B005C4FD0Q,Ingie,4,I just loved this show. I was surprised I had not been watching this show on a regular basis. I love the quirky characters. It is just a treat to watch. Now I need Season 4 to be available in unlimited streaming. :)
B005C4FD0Q,jim,4,I enjoy the series a great deal and look foward to new episodes and to also add to the collection  good job!
B005C4FD0Q,J. Ligon "JimL",4,Fun situations which include comedy and melodrama. Quick passage of time spent viewing and I enjoyed the series. Bring on the popcorn and your favorite beverage for a complete evening.
B005C4FD0Q,Jolynn Raymond,5,I really enjoy this show. The ideas the writers come up with related to the artifacts seem endless. The actors work very well with each other and have great chemistry. I'm glad I can sit down and watch the whole season and not have to wait with the cliff hanger ending to find out what happens at the end. I guess Amazon is o thank for that. Love my Amazon prime.
B005C4FD0Q,Kuhn Rich,4,items from history and lore with strange characteristics with a search and recover team to bring them back and store them
B005C4FD0Q,melvin watkins,5,still one the most talked about shows among sifi fans always has the best twist ever no explaining needed just watch this show
B005C4FD0Q,Mgriffin2312,4,Great show! Good for the whole family!
B005C4FD0Q,Progressive Penguin "Progpen",5,One of the best shows on Syfy.  Too bad Syfy still hasn't figured this out and is canceling the show.
B005C4FD0Q,Rotatiller,4,I really like this show. It is very fun and interesting. It has lots of action and good characters. The first 2 seasons are wonderful. This one is still great but took out a character that I didn't want to see go and brought in a gay guy and those issues that I don't care to watch. Otherwise the theme of what they do is still interesting and fun.
B005C4FD0Q,ROY,5,This is one series that from edition to edition you are in complete wonderment as to what will happen next. Each edition iscompletely different each time.
B005C4FD0Q,sharon kemm,5,what an enjoyable series. it's not over. where's the rest? I want more. loved the characters and the story line was fantastic. I want more.
B005C4FD0Q,Steve Bystrak,5,Another I will miss.
B005C4FD0Q,Sue Boyle "blue9244",5,I wish there were another season to watch because I am so hooked on this series.  The actors are believable and the premise so entertaining that I get completely absorbed.  Watch just one or two episodes and you will be riveted!
B005C4FD0Q,Terri,5,I loved this movie it was fun and really enjoyable snd entertaining to watch would recommend it to anyone to watch
B005C4FD0Q,Tori Stegle,5,This season followed suit with all the others. It was awesome and there were so many cool artifacts!  Keep it up Syfy!
B005C4FD0Q,victoria,5,This is one of the most entertaining series we've watched and what makes it so cool is that it inter-connects with Eureka. which is equally as good. sometimes the characters from Eureka appear on warehouse 13 and vice versa so we bounce back and forth between the 2 of them. meaning we watch one season of warehouse 13 then watch a season of Eureka. you will just love these 2 series. Try them and you will see.
B005C4FD0Q,Wolfar,5,I am very saddened that this will be canceled after season 5. I love this series and can hardly wait for season 5!
B005CRVDR0,Adrianne M. Callahan "3kmom",4,I liked this season but I didn't catch my eye like season 2 and 3 do. But it was very very interesting because Abby was nicer in this season and so were the moms. I liked that the best!
B005CRVDR0,Cathy Dunican,5,great show and season one is the best  see it from the beginning  the girls are younger and you can see the beginning of the drama moms
B005CRVDR0,Christine Vogelsang,4,Don't know why I love this show but can't wait to see what Abby and Kathy do next.  Hopefully the Dance Moms will continue to protect their kids.
B005CRVDR0,Mary paushel,5,Love it. Now I can always watch it. I want to own every episode. I want more more more. Please.
B005CRVDR0,racergal,4,Dance Moms is entertaining. I just kind of wish it were a drama/comedy. Knowing that people act that way is disturbing on one level. But I can't help but think production might tell them to ramp it up a bit. The moms going to a bar while at the dance competition was way out of line. There doesn't seem to be a lot of respect between the adults on this show. It's like mean girls grown up! The girls are so well behaved and nice to each other. The adults could take lessons.
B005CRVDR0,T. L. Smith,5,I enjoy watching the over the top dancing moms. It truly shows man sin and how we hurt one another.
B005CRVDR0,Ty's Tiny Tip,5,I loved it! I will admit that I am a reality TV junky and  lately my reality TV shows have lacked luster. And then I discovered Dance Moms and these ladies  have a whole new set of drama! Whoa!
B005CRVDR0,wdwenthusiast,3,I really enjoy watching the girls dance but the show is called Dance Moms for a reason. There is a lot of drama and swearing with a fair bit of bad behavior from the moms mixed in. You have to have a stomach for nonsense to watch this show.
B005CZM5DI,AzLou,5,I am so happy with these new TV series based on supernatural events and story plots. This one is a winner. Every episodes keeps you at the edge of your seat! Special effects are awesome. Kudos!!!
B005CZM5DI,B. Hamlin,5,The show is weird and wonderful. I love science-fiction and this show really provides a good story. It is well acted and the plots are riveting.
B005CZM5DI,Book worm,5,I really enjoy this show as it is different from most other shows out there.  It also does not use a lot of bad language which is a big turn off to me.
B005CZM5DI,Diane S,5,I watched season 1 and wanted more.  Season 4 was already beginning on tv so I purchased season 2 & 3 so I could catch up.
B005CZM5DI,DIANNA,5,HAVEN IS MY FAVORITE TV SHOW I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES SCI FI SHOWS.IT HAS SUSPENCE AND SOME ACTION
B005CZM5DI,G. M. Curtis,5,This show just gets better and better as the writers throw twists at you. I thought season one was great. Season two is better.
B005CZM5DI,Holly Kubaskie,4,Something about this series appeals to me. I've watched the first season more than once. I'm waiting for the next season. Its a quirky urban fantasy setting. Its original idea was inspired by a Stephen King short story. I recommend starting withe the first episode and watching it in order. It doesn't make as much sense out of order. The characters are good and the development over time shows. I have seen comments about the show being ridiculous. Its dark with good human aspects and not based on plausibility.
B005CZM5DI,Kathy Miller,5,Good show and can watch it again and again.  Love the actors on the show.  Keep up the good work.
B005CZM5DI,kbertch,5,I anxiously await Friday nights so that I can see what happens in Haven next.  Will Audrey and Nathan ever be happy together?  We'll see.
B005CZM5DI,Kris,5,Love this show. It is based on a book. It is a very strange show but fun. No problems with the DVDs and came fast.
B005CZM5DI,Larry McAuley,5,An excellent series.  I missed it when it first aired because I wasn't into the characters.  Now I get the premise of them all and have enjoyed going back and catching up.  The only downside it that it does not have CC capability.  When there are a bunch of people around talking I can't keep up without headphones.
B005CZM5DI,Laura Fletcher "WOLF Women",5,I have season one too. I love Haven for the interesting plots and the actors are good at making you believe what is happening.
B005CZM5DI,L.J. Brown,5,wonderful show.  I find that most of the not quite normal shows are more interesting than the ones that follow the tried and true line
B005CZM5DI,lremick,5,I really like the Sci-Fi aspects of this series and how the &#34;troiubles&#34; are resolved. Throughly enjoyed the season. Looking forward to seeing season three.
B005CZM5DI,Lynn McBee,4,I enjoyed this second season better than the first. There are still so many more questions left unanswered. I am hoping that this series does a better job of answering these questions than &#34;Lost&#34; did.
B005CZM5DI,Pulpman,4,I really like this show. I watched as soon as I got it and was not dissappointed. The charcters are developing nicely and the mystery was still there. I want to get the third season already. Fun show and it draws you in. Good chemistry between the leads help keep you watching.
B005CZM5DI,ROY,5,Hoping that season two is as great as season one..You didn't know from week to week what was next...If the second season is as good as the fist it will be worth waiting for...
B005CZM5DI,Sammie Kaie "Sammie",5,I enjoyed the first series a lot so I am about half way throught season 2 and still enjoying it. The characters are good. Well scripted and hasn't become boring. If you like syfy I recommend it.
B005CZM5DI,Steven Epley,5,I am a huge fan of this series but despise commercials. I will also be buying season 3 when becomes available. I love the whole premise of the show as well as the central characters.
B005CZM5DI,Susan Harris,5,Great scifi series. I couldn't wait for fall to come so I could watch the series again. A must see series.
B005D63I78,Andrew J. Sweeney "very amateur cook",3,first episode was good. second and third sort of limped due to story quality which petered out. acting was good as was the basicsetting of the story. i'll probably try it again when new showings are available.
B005D63I78,B.G. Arnold,4,A subtle beginning that builds to an exciting finish. Plus it has a great cast. I look forward to the next one.
B005D63I78,brenda "open door",3,I liked this show very much I am sorry it was never renewed by the BBC.  Maybe someone else is like me and the repetative noise (dare I call it music) all but ruins the show for me as I just want to run screaming from the room. Just as I get ready to do that it stops and I can enjoy the show again.  I really do like the show. The same bars of music playing over and over is not music. It is an annoyance.
B005D63I78,gary blakely,4,twists and turns ....but Zen will always be there stand up and get to the bottom...worth a watch on a weekend with rain
B005D63I78,GelSailing,4,Good writing. Not as predictable as most. British accents are understandable for the most part. But I don't know if I'd pay for subscription
B005D63I78,gizzy,5,This was an excellent series and different from so many other police detective shows because it was set in Italy--a very alien environment. Loved Rufus Sewell in this.Can't believe the BBC canceled this after only one season. I've seen a number of BBC shows that deserved it more. Heard some new honcho there started throwing his weight around and began ripping and shredding. What a shame.
B005D63I78,Jamie,5,Good plots set in Rome for a change of locale as a change of pace. Experience Brits with Italian accents! The series could have been longer.
B005D63I78,Mark "mdgross",4,Really good plots.  Great acting and directing.  Locale of Rome was fun to watch.  And in English.  I wish there was more than one season.
B005D63I78,Nevermore,5,An excellent mystery series. Well acted and gripping with plenty of plot twists to keep the viewers guessing. Too bad they only made three episodes.
B005D63I78,Peggy H. Rose,1,Not up to the caliber of most well done British mysteries.  We tried to watch it but it did not hold our attention.
B005D63I78,Richard R,5,I wish this would continue as an on going series. I really enjoyed the Italian interaction of government and police department.God plots that keep you coming back for more
B005D63I78,Wiliam Myers,4,I didn't know what to expect in the series - but have seen him in other productions and liked him  --- as I did in this one as well -- just wish there were more seasons and more episodes -- but can't seem to find any more than couple of the season 1.
B005D9LD6I,H. Jeanne Rockwell,4,A great group of characters on this season and good variety of &#34;challenges&#34;.  Love the fashions produced on the show.
B005D9LD6I,Jessica Capizzo "undermyhat",5,I love project runway! I dont like the episodes that are unconventional materials...they are just stupid..clothes from candy...please! no designer ever designed with stupid materials. And...really need to say the negative things about a designers design when they have guests to design for when the guest is not on the runway...its hurtful to be told the person who designed something you love designed something you think is ugly or whatever..when the guest obviously loves it.
B005D9LD6I,Wes B.,5,Fun and colorful. Letting your mind go as watch people go for their dreams. Drama and fashion all in one.
B005DJRD80,Amazon Customer,5,Captures the humor and feel of high school without being too broad.  The characters are well developed although the main character should make a mistake or two to be a little more believable.
B005DJRD80,Constance,5,I love this show so of course I am buying all of the seasons to it. It came as described. I have no complaints.
B005DJRD80,CornDawg,1,Not appropriate to watch. Guess I am naive but this should be rated 'R' for graphic scenes and language. Can't believe parents would say these kinds of things to their children. I do not recommend this to anyone.
B005DJRD80,Crystal Jackson,5,Jenna's character is surrounded by even more awesome characters.  This comedic portrayal of an average teenager is not so average in its content.  It is quirky and definitely has an underlying tone of realness amongst the over the top drama.  There is a character for everyone to identify with in one way or another.
B005DJRD80,ilikebooks,5,Although it really isn't an accurate depiction of high school (characters are just a little too clever) it's a funny show.  It keeps me entertained and I like how it's run serially so it's a continuous story line.  Unfortunately these types of shows are rarely around for long because of the nature of the story lines.  But I will enjoy watching while it lasts!
B005DJRD80,joan,5,Although I am older and shouldn't like this type of show I do!!  It is very funny and I am enjoying it very much!
B005DJRD80,Katycaboose "Katty",5,A light bit of fun delving into the teenage years of high school relationships and problems.  More modern than yester-years.
B005DJRD80,kmoore,5,Such a good show. I love the love triangle stuff and the counselor on the show is soooo funny. YOU'RE WELCOME
B005DJRD80,Knight68 "EM",3,I watched one episode of the first season then decided that this show was meant for teenagers or even early twenties.  Since I am not of that generation the show held little for me.
B005DJRD80,Martin Allain,4,A high school student weeding through the culture of high school and her mothers fears and needs. It is humorous and interesting to see the challenges she faces.
B005DJRD80,Melanie,4,It's more for young people but it was cute.  Not my sort of thing but I think people in the 15 to 20 range would very much enjoy it.
B005DJRD80,Monaghan "ReMo",5,absolutely awesome show!! Great writing and a wonderful cast! Recently discovered and now I have my whole family is addicted
B005DJRD80,Moonbiter,3,Pretty good.  That's why I gave it three stars.  I most likely won't watch it again but I'm not sorry that I watched it in the first place.
B005DJRD80,ms,4,Nothing like my high school experience of being actually awkward but well written show and great jokes. The characters have charisma while also being a little whiny sometimes but it's a nice thing to put on and hang out and watch mindlessly.
B005DJRD80,Myrna I McKnight,3,Off the wall humor and laughed out loud several times. We've all been there at one time and can relate to what's going on.
B005DJRD80,Pamala Pickard,4,It was ok but not as exciting to me as some other programs that I have seen before on TV.
B005DJRD80,roxy,5,Funny and addictive!
B005DPJ6VQ,barbie "doggy mom",5,Another great reality show! Cant get enough of the YEP lol. Barry has to be my personal favorite in this show. Great reality show!
B005DPJ6VQ,Beverly A. Vokoun "justauntb",5,Storage Wars is addictive. It is entertaining and funny. You get to know the characters and can't wait to see who gets the biggest deal. I highly recommend this program.
B005DPJ6VQ,Bill D. "Billy D.",4,Each show has a little suspense as you wait to see if their gamble pays off.  They try try hard to create a villan but the most they can do is obnoxious.  Good tv for 20 minutes.
B005DPJ6VQ,Cappnormal,5,What a great show! Just too bad Hester was lost.  He added quite a bit to the show and I wish they would get him back.
B005DPJ6VQ,Cortney Yonker,5,This show is so addicting. The guys in the show are the best. My family we make bets to see who will get the units. I just wish they would show more of the items that they get in the units that they buy.
B005DPJ6VQ,Debra Cook,5,Lots of fun.  I would recommend this to everyone.  It's nice to see when the right person gets the right locker and makes out good with it.
B005DPJ6VQ,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,There's not much I can I say I didn't already say. Other than this is a great season. I do like how the different bidders are showcased and touched on.
B005DPJ6VQ,Jannieknows "Jannie",4,Storage Wars Season 2 Scores!I have come to like this show.  We know the characters...and they are just that.  Characters.  They don't play nice sometimes-but that is what this business is all about.  It is fun to find treasures with them.  If you are in the mood for a short and entertaining show-tune in.  It's never boring and you never know what they will find behind the storage doors.  Thanks.
B005DPJ6VQ,Joseph J Mallory,3,After you have watched a few series there is no more mystery. Its just something to pass time when I have nothing to do.
B005DPJ6VQ,K. R. Merryman,4,If you can get past the &#34;YEEUUUP&#34;... you'll be entertained by this show.  You have to watch from the first episode in order to see the evolution of each characters relationship with each other and their growing knowledge of what &#34;is&#34; and &#34;is not&#34; valuable.
B005DPJ6VQ,Linda Pawson,5,I love Storage Wars.  Watch it on tv but I have missed a few episodes.  I love the fact that I can go to Amazon Prime and watchthe shows I've missed.  I especially like having no commercials!  The episodes I watched were great.  I love the cast.  Barry hasto be my favorite!  The picture was clear.  No problems.  Highly recommend!!
B005DPJ6VQ,Melissa,4,Think this is funny to watch some of it is irritating but sometimes interesting finds but theres no way I would spend that much money on some of those lockers no no lol
B005DPJ6VQ,Mystery Shopper,5,There may be all kinds of things someone could find fault with but overall the show is entertaining and we like watching it.  You have to wonder if someone could really find some of the things they find in &#34;real life&#34; but it keeps the show going and keeps us watching.
B005DPJ6VQ,Patrice L. Geathers "yenomden",5,I truly love this show. It features real people during something I would love to do. Travel and make money. I would like to know where they get their &#34;seed&#34; money to do this. Excellent show!
B005DPJ6VQ,S. CONRAD,5,I cant get a nuff of storage wars. great show. you can see some realy good deal. I recommand this to everyone.
B005DPJ6VQ,S. S. "Super",4,These are some funny and strange people.  Fun to watch but I don't know why oddities are potentially going to be discovered I suppose
B005EEBERA,Crafts lover.,3,This si another try to shed some light into a story that nothing new can be told is starting to get boring. Not worth the time wasted to see the same tired old story.
B005EEBERA,Darlene Walker,4,I an not sure of how true the facts are in this movie but I did enjoy it as entertainment.
B005EEBERA,Debra L. Jensen,1,terrible is about all I can say.
B005EEBERA,T. Buckner "cmc",4,I had great feelings about princess di.  I totally agree that there was a conspiracy when she died. I have read several books and read the book too.  I think all princess di fans would enjoy it.
B005EPFA8I,Michael Dobey,5,This is a excellent documentary about the cave paintings in france. The 3d is native and it's a great little interesting set to watch. However they used two cameras hand held in some scenes that means that in some scenes the 3d doesn't come together well.Making bad ghosting problems. BUt the other scenes make up for this as  you get real depth and this is the only way to see this cave ever. No tourists will ever go in there. Warner Herzog who has made some great movies in his day including 'fitzcardo' narrates here. He's from GERMANY and has a accent but he's also a great filmmaker. With credits like 'grizzly man' and 'my best fiend" under his belt. The 3d is there to give depth and that's about it. This isn't a underwater experience. Too many 3d fans want things to fly out at them. That isn't the case with most 3d. It's just there for depth. This was shot in hd though and that helps. It's a wonderful show where you will learn things if you want something more then you will be disapointed.
B005F2BB3I,Alice,4,I enjoy the graphics and onsite filming of archeological sites which at times is very thought provoking. Would prefer less opinions and more scientific evidence.
B005F2BB3I,alicia myers,5,watch out its very addicting... I like all the people on the show and every show is really good.. keeps you interested.
B005F2BB3I,Cameron Tarantino,3,This is a well-done series; it's obvious much care and money went into making it.  I have enjoyed the episodes we've watched so far and will continue to watch more!  Recommended for those with a hankering for truth--conjecture be damned!
B005F2BB3I,DGator,5,Well if you are interested in this subject this DVD series is for you. There is a lot of information that is spoken of in this series and a lot to think about. Even if you do not believe in the subject it is very interesting and entertaining.
B005F2BB3I,Ekay,4,Lots of questions regarding alien intervention related to everything from science to religion. Ancient alien theorists conclusions will give you a lot to think about but after each episode the big questions still remain & you have to draw your own conclusions.
B005F2BB3I,Gary W. Luster,5,I really liked this movie. It got me to thinking and was informative.The History channel always has good documentaries. I would suggest anyone to watch this documentary.
B005F2BB3I,G. Lett "George",5,Informational TV series that makes you think about all of the misguided information that has been spread throughout the century's.
B005F2BB3I,Greg,5,Reasonable connections drawn from facts and history. Multiple topics covered to keep you entertained using 45 minute shows (without commercials).
B005F2BB3I,Greg,5,Great show. It comes up with ideas for some of histories most controversial stories. Only bad thing is it sometimes gives more questions then answers.
B005F2BB3I,jks1980,5,Fascinating intriguing. One of the best series on tv. Makes you question your beliefs. Interesting and intelligent. Amazing. TV a must watch
B005F2BB3I,Joey Abbott,5,The stories are great and gets us to think of the possibilities of what else is out there. There is so much to learn about our past to learn about our future.
B005F2BB3I,Lawrence,5,This documentary is very helpful and enlightened me on why there are strange things that our ancestors saw and was enterpreted as well.
B005F2BB3I,Mark and Lindsay,4,I have watched all three seasons back to back with anitcipation. I have learned so much! I hope more seasons follow.
B005F2BB3I,Michael L. Lowenstein,5,a wonderful series again streaming to my ROKU was flawless with a HD picture.Maybe we did come from the stars.
B005F2BB3I,Paul Aguirre,5,I love this show they raise a lot of interesting question you should check it out you will be amazed at what they talk about and the evidence they provide
B005FF3U34,M. Webster "None",5,Shark week taught me a lot of things that I did not know about sharks.  It is a very interesting and informative series.
B005FF3U34,rm,5,This is very educational to watch. I am so glad I watch it! Even my son started watching it with me. Explains how the sharks are now attaching human and why they are all the different sharks in the world and so on. It is very much worth watching it.
B005FOLGU4,catthief,5,Please do more seasons.  This was a terrific and realistic show.  We need to know what's happening in our world and this show and similiar shows let us know and give us an opportunity to have an opinion.
B005FOLGU4,Michael Duffy,4,a decent canadian attempt at a field hospital in afghanistan. thankfully it is NOTHING like MASH!  decent writing and plots. some great acting actually i liked it.
B005FYL60E,bbrockRailFan "Brian Brocksmith",1,Low Low Budget stinker. The special effects are terrible. The acting is ridiculous. The story is boring. I loved Nude Nuns With Big Guns but this movie is not even in the same league as Nude Nuns. Done waste your money.
B005G190U4,Bob's girl,4,I enjoyed Main Street because it was look not too far back in our history.  It was well written with just the right amount of drama played out by the different characters.  The characters for the most part were not related; yet the story line covered each facet of life from the old to those just getting started in their adult life.  Another thread of the story line was progress in commerce&#8230;a familiar thread in the fabric and making of America.  I thought it was a thought provoking movie that was entertaining at the same time.  Bob&#8217;s girl
B005GNQ1J0,Amazon Customer,5,As I said in season 2's review; If you like guns & competition shows this is defiantly a show for you as well as seeing some of the most awesome weapons use through the years as well as new and improved.  This show seems to be finding it's own and getting better and better. I really enjoy this show
B005GNQ1J0,Cortney Yonker,5,Just like the other seasons my family can't wait for another season. I love how they use a variety of guns and different courses.
B005GNQ1J0,Jeanette,5,My husband and I really enjoy watching this show. You get see all different types of weapons and witness the skill and marksmanship of those that compete.
B005GNQ1J0,Wendy L. Stivers,5,Saw lots of new weapons and the show had a wide variety of weapons.  The finish was exhilarating and great!
B005GT575S,Anne,4,Learn about events in the fifties from the British point of view. Get involved with very interesting characters & experience their lifestyle.
B005GT575S,Book Lover,4,It is fun to see Dominic West (The Wire) in a totally different milieu. This is a good atmospheric British series.
B005GT575S,Donna M. Dluehosh,5,I really enjoyed the history along with the story and intrigue; the characters have substance. Wish there was a third season out.
B005GT575S,E3 "E3",5,Dominic West was the initial draw to this series but after the first episode the writing and entire cast had me hooked.  Kept me up way too late trying to watch as many as possible each night.
B005GT575S,E. Magno,3,The show has some interesting moments but the characters really don't inspire interest and the plot line didn't really engage my interest in a compelling way.
B005GT575S,James R. Turner,4,Like a ninety's series - not too much - fast pace - but need to develop actor parts more - just need time I guess
B005GT575S,Janet Atkinson - Q15J,5,i watched both seasons - can hardly wait for the next one because they really left us hanging in suspense
B005GT575S,Justicried,5,This show does a good job developing its characters.  It draws you into the lives of the different people and allows a view to understand their different life perspectives.  Although it is not fast paced the mystery underneath keeps it going at an interesting level. The element of danger keeps it exciting too.
B005GT575S,Lucky Leo,4,I like this new way of suspense You can watch the cast become alive as more and more start too happen.
B005GT575S,MS,3,Plot got muddled as I recall. Not memorable.  Forgot why I watched it. I don't think I watched it all the way through.
B005GT575S,MWOO,5,The writing of this series is supberb.  I rate it right alone with Mad Men.  The timeand the social issues are perfectly well played.
B005GT575S,NHB "show me",4,Would love to review after I've finished it.  That will take some time but so far I really like it a lot and look forward to more!
B005GT575S,O. Mallard,3,Don't know why I watched all the episodes. I kept waiting for something to happen. Seemed to move too slow for my taste. GuessI'm just hooked on the old British shows.
B005GT575S,Pat Achor,5,I really enjoyed this whole series.  It had a very good plot and very well acted.  I am going to watch the next season.
B005GT575S,Richard Guion,2,I'm a big fan of a lot of British TV shows and I like Dominic West.  But I couldn't get into this show at all.  I really wanted to like it but it seemed to be dropping breadcrumbs all over the place and never picking them up.  I suppose I had the wrong expectations going into it.
B005GT575S,Richie,5,Really good series set in the late 50's....The British know how to do great TV and this is another of the fine shows.
B005GT575S,Romona Burton,1,Can't think of one good thing to say about this production.  Unless it we snore fest.  As sad waste of time.  Do not bother.
B005GT575S,Viv,5,A very engrossing story of news people and their stories. I enjoy all the actors and have seen the second season. An interesting show.
B005HBT5VC,C E Matthews,5,This is a good series for a pre-teen. It is funny and clever and my son loves it. I have no issue with him watching it either. There are some other questionable shows he has asked to watch - I am glad he likes this - because I don't have an issue with him watching it.
B005HBT5VC,LADONNA HARVEY "LaHarvey",5,The characters of these episodes grow on you and you find yourself watching them over and over. My kids love to watch them over and over.
B005HBT5VC,r. laver,5,i love this show so much it me and my friends watch it all day long i love it.thank you
B005HEFE28,D. Moore "Dano",4,This was one fun good TV show. And still is..But not at this price....I will sit tight.... And wait until it comes down..
B005HEFE28,nythawk,5,If you look on the far left at 13:06 in the background you can see a person running out of the scene. This was an excellent episode. I wish the series wasn't cancelled. It was getting better in the 3rd and 4th seasons.
B005HFXHIU,Amazon Customer "curling acs",5,Enjoyed the series. I have watched the series more than once.  Enjoy both Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing.  Amusing comedy.
B005HFXHIU,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",5,Great performances by all the actors and great humor. Pity this series only ran for one season! I would happily have watched many more seasons.
B005HFXHIU,Big A "Wesley",4,I'm not sure why this show got canceled. Ty Burrell is just as great as he is on Modern Family and the rest of the cast are just as spot on with their comedic delivery. If you like Modern Family I would definitely recommend this show.
B005HFXHIU,Carol,5,one of the best sitcoms I've seen recently. sure don't know why it was cancelled with that great cast.
B005HFXHIU,E. Lillian Creveling,1,Terrible. If you like bad jokes and bad language then you will like it. But I didn't like it at all.
B005HFXHIU,grace,5,Good writing excellent cast..  Funny situations. Laughed out loud lots of times. Recommend to lift your spirits. Timely in many ways.
B005HFXHIU,K. Gilmore "K Gilmore",4,I have only watched a couple of these so far but find it to be a pretty good comedy! I like the characters and can't wait to see where they take the silliness next!
B005HFXHIU,MaxJ,5,This is one of those best shows that should have been on longer than it was.There is only one season of this series and there should have been more.  I don't know why it  left the air so soon because it is one of  the most consistently entertaining series ever.  I have watched it over and over and still laugh.
B005HFXHIU,M. Engel,5,Funny sexy cute
B005HFXHIU,Rocking Rod,3,Good comedy but I've only seen a few episodes. Very agile and quickly paced!  Wonderful cast. I love S. Channing.
B005HFXHIU,S. Marsh,5,Too bad this wasn't renewed. Liked watching this to give me a break between episodes of Damages. Liked all the actors.
B005I1S55S,blair,4,If your family or your friends family or dealing with problem children who might be on the wrong side of the law I recommend watching this show it's not always age appropriate but they do give a parental advisory at the beginning of each program I'm glad that they actually did come up with this program because any good parents raising their children would not want to see them go to jail the program shows you just what it's like to be incarcerated the children that are on the shows are usually from the ages of 12 to 17 it's touching heartwarming and scary at times well worth checking out for those parents who think their children might be heading in the wrong direction I recommend it! :)
B005I1S55S,Michael,5,My wife and I cannot get enough of this show. We both agree that the entertainment value alone from watching know it all punks get a life lesson in reality is worth the cost of our membership.
B005I1S55S,readinglarge,5,This is the ongoing program that shows troubled terns a raw rare look at where they are heading.the success rate of this program speaks for itself.
B005IWN5EI,Rw Scolari "navy689",4,i went into this movie not expecting much and was very pleasantly surprised.  If you like scifi this you will like this one.  The effects are a bit cheezy but the plot line is interesting.  Worth a look
B005JR3JC0,Lauren,5,I love WHITNEY!! She's hilarious and has a great supporting cast. My husband actually had me buy this as we're on season 2 and he really likes it as well. Very very funny and definitely recommended for anyone that likes real comedy.
B005JR3PMY,sharron reader "SPEED READER",5,WATCHED EVERY EPISODE. THIS IS A GREAT SHOW !  PURCHASED THE SEASON . I WISH THEY WOULD PUT IT BACK ON THE AIR!
B005JR3PMY,William Gustafson,4,The stories were generally interesting with a few good characters and fair acting. It is an Americanization of the earlier British drama of the same name.  Don't expect a season 2
B005JR3S0I,Christopher Rech,5,My wife and I have followed Law and Order SVU since the first day it started. This season was just as great as it has always been! Never a disappointment in the Law and Order series!!
B005JR3S0I,JCruea10,5,I've seen every episode except for season 14 and the beginning of 15 but trying to get up to date.  I stopped watching because Elliott Stabler is gone now but still is a great show.  Wish he would come back!
B005JR3S0I,rm,4,i love this show but this is another show you have to pay for to watch but again i do like it so of course i have no choice to pay for it sense i do love it. lol.
B005JR3TUM,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",5,I never thought that I would like Glee so much. But the actors are so talented and there is a lot of musical variety. I am looking forward to the next season but am at a loss as to how they can continue after all the graduations. Great fun...
B005JR3TUM,Dan Hangen,5,I like how the show is progressing and it is interesting to see how the songs and storyline blend together.  A true gem of a show.
B005JR3TUM,DrJoey,5,The leprechaun and the irritant were not in this episode...I am so glad they guys behind the show have taken the negative energy of those two out of the show...it was soooo enjoyable to watch...
B005JR3TUM,Elizabeth Good,4,I love the musical performances. The writers do a wonderful job of handling current hot teen issues. The characters are fun and appealing.
B005JR3TUM,jess,4,this show isnt what it used to be but i still love to watch it for the original cast members.
B005JR3TUM,mayzey "d.littin",4,I really like this on tv. I watched most of the first season then. I have caught one or two in other seasons. This does not stand up if you try to watch more than one at a time.
B005JR3TUM,Michael F. Louis "MFL",5,They are all so professional and such wonderful talents.  Cory Monteith was such a marvelous character and it is such a shame that he expired on drugs.  Breaks my heart to think about it
B005JR3TUM,Robert Hankins,5,Best season of the three I have seen to date.  The music was very good and the relationships developed more substance.
B005JR3TUM,Steve Abbott,2,I only caught a few episodes of this while my girlfriend was watching it.  It's just not my thing.  Weird spur of the moment singing with awful pseudo-adult drama.
B005JR3TUM,tomtom,5,Season 3 is great and sad at the same time. You get to care about the cast but you know that it will never be the same.
B005JR3TUM,Vico96,5,The only reason I watched this show is because Matt Bomer was on it. It was so worth it!!  He was funny and so adorable!!  I actually kinda liked the show itself becuase of Matt Bomer being on it.  I've watched it a couple times now.  They need to have him on it all the time though...really makes it worth watching.
B005JR3Y5W,Al,3,3 guys living with girl whom they treat like their little sister even though she is full grown woman and educator of children.  They act a gang of teenagers
B005JR3Y5W,BrownCoat 96760 "browncoat96760",5,The only comedy show that I can actually laugh with since Friends. Timing is accurate. Everyone needs a Schmidt. Winston is overlooked and does have his own special moments. and Nick and Jess is the new Ross and Rachel.  Love Love Love Love Love Love. The only comedy on air that I dvr currently. The rest just fall flat and make me want slap people. This show makes me laugh with them and want to hang out with them. Love my Nick and Jess as well as Schmidt and CeCe.
B005JR3Y5W,Constance,5,This is a great show. It is quirky. I love Jess. This show is great for all types of audiences and it is very funny.
B005JR3Y5W,roxy,5,So funny! She's such a girly girl but a guys girl too. A bit too dorky at times but thats what makes this show great.
B005JR4B54,Amazon Customer,4,I thought this was a great show. I really got into it and loved seeing the dinosaurs.. So bummed they cancelled the series! This season is still great though and I enjoyed watching.
B005JR4B54,dennis headley,1,Not understanding why they are selling a season pass to a show that they do not have rights to show to you. Why am I getting charged for the new episode when I can't even watch it?
B005JR4B54,Mary E. Shipman "LizMoves",5,Loved this show. Sorry it was cancelled. It left me wanting to see more.
B005JR4B54,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,i loved this show my mother in law showed it to me and i got addited and i cant wait untill the next season comes out.
B005K1MJ4E,K.V.,5,Awesomely funny. Variety of videos. Good humor. Rob is a great host and I enjoyed every episode. Never boring. Awesome.
B005K1MJ4E,Z. J. Garcia "snozwanger",5,Great show. The guests are interesting. The comments about the clips are funny. WARNING!!! Do not watch if you cannot stand the sight of people getting hurt. The show is basically all about clips of people getting injured.
B005KM0PZS,A. Lynn Bowman "muzikluvrrr",5,I don't know what more I could say about this Season 2 DVD but too funny.  The ladies are in rare form and are actresses that seem to have brought everything to this show you could ask for.  There is a constant stream of top notch guest stars from TVs glory days that also make this a must own DVD.  I can't wait to get Season 3 when it comes out and if they keep going I will be overjoyed.
B005KM0PZS,DrJoey,5,This is one of the best shows...though it doesn't have the one liners to remember like..."if you were anymore of a bitch you would have puppies"...and "someone to call me bitch and make it feel like a hug"...but all in all a good one...and i can't wait to see betty and don rickles do routine together...i thoroughly enjoyed this episode...
B005KM0PZS,drummer593,5,This sitcom is as funny as all hell! These girls crack me up! I think it is cool! Period! Everyone should have this in your collection!
B005KM0PZS,M. Naidas,5,Hilarious. Love the ladies. They remind me of my mama and her sisters joking and share their thoughts and advise.
B005KM0PZS,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",5,I don't have cable and watched the first 3 seasons in a row. The actresses delight and Betty White is superb.
B005KO31OI,Edgar,5,each season is better then the last these guys really know what is funny and like to push the limits in what they say and do truly a funny show
B005KO31OI,MickeyT "MickeyT",5,This is a show that is always fresh and crazy. Seeing it on DVD beats on TV any day because it is uncensored and right out there. The seasons keep getting better and better.
B005KO352G,Brian "batfan",5,I probably shouldn't like this show so much.  Archer is so wrong it's right.  Hopefully you are not easily offended.
B005KO352G,Brian,5,Even better than the first two seasons. It is laugh-out-loud funny. All the characters have really started to come together.
B005KO352G,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",4,I loves me some campy humor.Wait. Didn't I just say that?This series never fails to shock and startle me. But in GOOD WAY THAT MAKES ME LAUGH.
B005KO352G,Devora,5,I enjoyed Archer I missed it on FX but to watch it without commercials laughed my butt off. Great adult cartoon
B005KO352G,Eric Schneider,4,Season 1 was a bit monotonous but into season 2-3 the writing and character development improved.  There are some story lines that weave through the series.  It is good to see details in the drawing being carried through; ie tattoos.
B005KO352G,Jack,5,you can't watch an episode without laughing or amazed at the hilarious situations portrayed. all the characters are quite unique.
B005KO352G,Lyns the cook,5,Absolute amazing show. All the characters are great and well played. Archer is one of the best shows ever. Awesome!
B005KO352G,Money_Maker,5,For those who still like to watch cartoons this is a good one for adults it has a little bit of everything in it
B005KO352G,Rachel Kessinger,5,We have season 1&2 and have watched them more than 5 times each. I wish season 3 would be out in time for a Christmas present but I guess we will have to wait. All I am saying is give Archer a chance! It freaking rocks! So splooshing awesome!
B005KO352G,Richard Pokallus,5,I have been watching this series since season one. It is a great spoof on the James Bond style movies in a cartoon setting.
B005KO352G,Richie,5,Clever adult cartoon...pretty funny take on the whole spy genre...not for kids...plenty of out loud laughs. Great for marathon viewing!
B005KO352G,Rusty,5,This is a well written show.  I die laughing at almost every episode.  The writers did a great job of melding all of the dysfunctional characters together.  A must watch.
B005KO352G,Scarlet,5,This series is as funny as it is ridiculous! H. Jon Benjamin & the rest of the cast do a great job in portraying this nutty spy agency.
B005KOAU7O,Amazon Customer,4,It is very refreshing to have Tim Allen back on TV.  The only thing missing are a couple of eyes peering over the backyard fence.
B005KOAU7O,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,Tim Allen does it again.  He has surrounded himself with a good cast and this show works.  Very funny and entertaining.  We stumbled across this by accident and we keep coming back for more.  The bad thing is this is a half hour program but Amazon charges the same as for an hour program.  This is a it frustrating.  We highly recommend this show.
B005KOAU7O,victoria,5,Tim Allen is one of our favorite actors and he didn't disappoint us in this series. He still has a sense of humor and is still the Tim we love.
B005KP7EK4,Camilla Stradley,3,This was a bit slow.  Not alot of action but still not one you will turn off.  A different side of Butch Cassidy.
B005KP7EK4,Christoph Forbes "AlabamaFanLouisianaMan",3,It was just ok.
B005KP7EK4,crosscountryman,5,Where oh where did the bandido ride off to after Etta left and allegedly Sundance died in Bolivia?  This is an excellent extrapolation of that theory with a kicker.  Many believe both men survived their escapes and exploits in South Amerika and returned to the States.  This movie poses an interesting possibility of the famous Robert Leroy Parker.  There are so many unsubstantiated theories and alleged historical trails one has to wonder or wander about~  I did my own sleuthing and have a definitive theory on one person's end~
B005KP7EK4,I. Behling,5,We thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Great acting too.  The story of what if Cassidy had not died as was shown; the story from his faked death onward.  Very enjoyable!
B005KP7EK4,J. Beane,3,I watched the entire film and thought it was slow moving. A lot of time was spent on what I felt were sections that could have been cut down a great deal. My wife got bored and went to bed without finishing it.
B005KP7EK4,Ron Baker,5,This western excels in its portrayal of an aging Butch Cassidy and Sam Shepard is perfect in this role. Highly believable portrayal of western life. Recommended.
B005KP7EK4,Tony,3,It was an interesting movie but I was expecting more action than it had.  It is ok to watch and had an interesting ending
B005KP7EK4,Verna Metzger,4,I wasn't sure about this movie at first but as I got into it I totally enjoyed it. Nice story about moral delima and how even a bank robber can come out on the right side.
B005M4QA12,Bernice E. Johnson,5,Audio and Video quality are excellent.  The characters in this series demonstrate team work and mutual respect while dealing with intense situations.
B005M4QA12,David Wright,4,I like the idea here is when you are in need of help they come and deal with the situation.
B005M4QA12,eric matheny,4,With some unrealistic we do everything kind of law enforcement this show is nice to watch if you don't take it seriously . Lol
B005M4QA12,Fast Freddy "Fred",4,Canada seems to come up with creative and fresh dramas.  Character development was slow but sure and I can't wait for season 5.
B005M4QA12,Garth R. Mailman,1,I have delayed writing this review to let my pique cool somewhat. Flashpoint is a Canadian production which makes no attempt to disguise the fact that it is shot in Toronto.Season 4 has 18 episodes but the three disks in this set marketed on Amazon.com in the US has only 13 episodes 6 of which are repeats from Season 3. This means the buyer is being cheated out of 11 of the 18 episodes. Calling this the Complete Season 4 is dishonest and frankly a rip-off.I'd like a refund and I would encourage anyone really interested to attempt to obtain the Canadian Version which actually has the complete set.
B005M4QA12,gary seamon,5,This is a great series to watch. it's great to see our friends in the north country on Television. The city are so clean.
B005M4QA12,Robert W. Evans,5,I love the show and every episode is as exciting as the other  give it five stars  Its such and exciting show
B005M4QA12,The Librarian,5,This is a terrific series. The characters and cast playing them are all top shelf as a whole. They do a great job of mixing just enough life with work life into the relationships and you really feel connected with the characters and the writing. The subject content really is compelling with such a great human element in the resolutions they try to bring into situations.. A+ 10
B005MRUB8C,kcimos,1,this is the most idiotic thing ever to be recorded. Loads of fake drama by a bunch of fools that have no business being on TV. This is definitely for the lowest common denominator (2 year-olds). Where do they get these people. The most common phrase from this show is &#34;come on! come on!&#34; OOH the intensity of all.
B005MRUB8C,Tootsie,5,This show is addicting. I cant get enough of it. I wish that Amazon Prime had more seasons on it however I am glad they had some.
B005MRUB8C,urbantantra "urbantantra",5,I love how much the placers appreciate the opportunity to be on the amazing race.  The challenges they face and the growth we witness them experience on the show is like nothing else I've seen on television.  I also think that the episodes are well edited to generate excitement and anticipation for us viewers.  Cinematography well captures the gorgeous landscapes and unique traditions of countries and cities visited by the race.
B005MW94QC,charismatic,5,Sarah is one of my favorite actresses and Ringer was one of the shows that showcased her talents. The show was always great from the first episode. I was so disappointed that it got canceled. Can't understand why it didn't have a bigger following. We at least I will always have season one.
B005MW94QC,ChristieL.,5,I really enjoyed Ringer and was super bummed when it was cancelled. I really would have liked to have seen another season after the cliffhanger finale!
B005MW94QC,ziex,5,I love this series ... maybe they producers could re-kindle it as an Internet only series.The pilot sets the tone for the remaining episodes in the season.  Bridget is tricked into believing that Siobhan has taken her own life by drowning.
B005O718OQ,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,I would have to say this is my new fav show. I was never a fan of the old one but this one is awesome.
B005O718OQ,EZELLA001,5,I did not miss the complete Season two I only purchased one episode; I never miss Hawaii Five-O but due to a Major Strom or Breaking News I was unable to record one of my favorite series. Thank God for instant video!
B005O718OQ,M. B. Feeser,5,This show is definitely better than the first one. The characters are more realisitic. They seem to have fun together and aren't afraid to show their feelings. The guys aren't bad to look at either!!
B005O718OQ,Otis H. McNutt "Hyrule's Savior",5,When a body is discovered with sign that point to an incarcerated serial killer called The Trashman Medical Examiner Max convinces the Five-0 Taskforce to reopen the case to help the innocent drifter accused of the crime and solve the murder of someone close to him.
B005O718OQ,stoneyb,5,I loved this show.  I like Alex shirtless and fighting  WOW. I also like how Steve helps out the man he hurt by fighting for him. to help the kids.  Nice
B005OHSOL6,Amazon Customer,5,My favorite show! Another great season! The final cliff hanger had me holding on to the edge of my seat the whole time!I can't wait until the next season is out of DVD!
B005OHSOL6,Betty J. Conner,5,We love NCIS and started watching it after it had been on TV for a while.  We then ordered all the seasons that we had missed and we have now completed season 10.
B005OHSOL6,Christine Perez,5,I love this show. Totally hook on it. It never loses steam. It doesn't get boring thanks to th stories and the actors.
B005OHSOL6,Constance,5,This is one of my all time favorite shows. I bought this to go with all the others I got. I have every season so far. i am waiting on season 10 to come on DVD and I will be buying it also.
B005OHSOL6,D. L. Cheever,5,Couldnk't wait for this one to come out so that we could go back and catch the little things that we missed when watching for the first time.
B005OHSOL6,EGOlsen,5,The CDs arrived timely and in good condition. NCIS just keeps getting better.  I do not fin d the interaction of Jethro and the FBI agent based on a mutual ex-wife of much interest.
B005OHSOL6,glacierbear,4,Tony seems to be realizing his mortality. He is not quite the jerk he was in previous seasonality still a jerk. Dixon's assistant is starting to take on Dr Mallard's penchant for story telling.  True NCIS adventure. Well worth the watch
B005OHSOL6,jim,4,It's nice to visit with Gibbs and the rest of the bunch and keep up with what is happening.. One of the best series on television
B005OHSOL6,Johanna Wiese,5,I love this show! Mark Harmon and crew really have great chemistry together on screen. I am happy to hear that Mark signed on for season 11 and so has the rest of the crew. Each show reveals a little bit more about each character. May this show live on for many more season... Sad day when it does end its reign.
B005OHSOL6,Kate "OhNo",5,I just love to watch NCIS..this time I cheated..could not wait for DVD to come out..so I purchased it from Amazon and watched it on my ROKU...What a great summer I had watching this instead of waiting for the DVD to come out in late August.....
B005OHSOL6,Kimberly Ward,5,A lovely season that continues to deepen the characters while maintaining the mystery elements of the show. Dbhiubfv thnfvtgntgbthtb that
B005OHSOL6,Kris,5,I have ordered all the seasons and have had no problems with any of the DVDs and they all came very fast. If you like the show order it.
B005OHSOL6,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,ncis is one of my favorit shows and i cant wait untill i get the 10th season the item was on time and in very good contion.
B005OHSOL6,Nedra Ann Schott,5,Don't know how much longer this will be on the air but I wanted to make sure I had it for all time.  I love to watch the reruns as much as the new shows.
B005OHSOL6,North Texas Girl,3,Flashbacks and dream sequences take the place of a story this week. No one bothered to write a real script.
B005OHSOL6,Retired in Hawaii,5,I now have the complete 9 seasons and like every one of them.  I cannot wait until Season 10 is released for purchase.
B005OHSOL6,Robert W. Evans,5,Awsome
B005OHSOL6,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I have to say this was another good episode of NCIS and I am going to say the writing was really good. I am a huge fan of NCIS and I hope in the future all episodes have this good of writing. I am pleased with my purchase.
B005OHSOL6,R. S. Neilson "Preacher",5,It is easy to see by the ratings how popular this show is but my wife and I are fairly picky about what we watch and this show is one of our favorites. We love the characters and the way they interact most of all. The stories are mostly great and PG rated so the whole family can watch.
B005OHSOL6,Vivian A. Robaldo "Viv",5,All actors and all programs with so many different and new ideas every week.  I have seen all seasons several times :)
B005OHSRWC,Amber Barefoot,5,It just keeps getting better.  The plots are interesting and the cast absolutely shines together.  The chemistry of the characters is perfect.
B005OHSRWC,djdave,4,I had enjoyed the original NCIS and the LA version has done a good job of holding my attention. Nice on going plot lines as well as character development.
B005OHSRWC,EGOlsen,4,The CDs arrived timely and in good shape. The story lines in NCIS LA are weak compared to the original but a good bit on entertainment once in a while
B005OHSRWC,michaelaen_37841,5,I think that the NCIS were it be the first one with Mark Harmon Or this One with LLcool J They Are both Grat Shows
B005OHSRWC,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",4,Always great to be able to watch without commercials. The extras were great except for the episode with Ruah and Christiansen doing a commentary which I was surprised at since they were so highly criticized for the job they did on the S2 DVD. Don't bother listening to their commentary.
B005OHSRWC,nelly123,5,This is another series which has great actors and storylines and how they involve all their lives in to the story I would recommend it to anyone
B005OHSRWC,Otis H. McNutt "Hyrule's Savior",5,Part 2 of the Hawaii Five-0/NCIS: Los Angeles crossover.After narrowly catching the criminal who is transporting a new strain of Smallpox the joint OSP/Five-0 taskforce must stop a deranged scientist from unleashing a pandemic that if left unchecked could threaten all of humanity.
B005OHSTFM,Connie,4,Like the show.  Watching Carrie analyze and figure out crimes while struggling with her own demons makes for an interesting show.
B005OHSTFM,David Wright,5,Soo as I finsihed watching the pilot of this show I need I was going to watch the others. Some of the shows on tv right now are just a waste of this one is not.
B005OHSTFM,diamonds,5,unforgettabe is a great show main charters are from my favorite show in the past.  nik/tuck and without a trace
B005OHSTFM,Douglas Deicke,5,Unforgettable was an awesome show because it shows how a female detective remembered every possible detail or clue about each homicide that she and her colleagues were trying to solve. Poppy Montgomery and Dylan Walsh are both excellent actors. I can't wait for season 2 of this show to start on July 28th.
B005OHSTFM,J3F,5,She looks good in dresses.  Great show with different perception on crime scenes.  I like the 3rd person memory imprints and focusing on the things she saw.  I am surprised that there are no offers from the NSA or CIA to be apart of their team. . .
B005OHSTFM,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I like Season One of Unforgettable for the writing and the cast. I sometimes disliked the fact that they brought up Carrie's past a lot. I think this a really good show and would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of crime dramas. This show has become on of my favorites.
B005OHSTFM,Shannon Thomas,5,This show has the perfect mix of humor and intelligence. I would recommended to anyone who enjoys cop dramas without all the doom. Much a long the lines of NCIS and Rizolli and Isles.
B005OHSTFM,Tumbleweed,3,Didn't really care for it. Some of it is too far out. She portrays herself as a woman of very loose morals for no apparent reason.
B005OPTRW8,Carla tamari,5,Just harmless fun the troupe works seamless lively  Hey it's not happening to you so go ahead live vicareiestly laugh yours gluts off.  The guys have the best intentions but no one can make good descions after injecting so drugs if you don't laugh then you must have aTight one
B005OPTRW8,Edgar,4,If you're a guy a stoner or love buddy comedies then this is the show for you watch these guys get into situations and prepare to crack up every time
B005OPTRW8,Fawn Perry,5,1 of the funniest shows on TV. Definitely need the rest of the seasons on instant video. Everyone should watch this.
B005OPTRW8,Keith E. Barber,4,Something of a workplace farce that is sometimes tortured and often unrealistic. But women and gay men may find the eye candy appealing enough to keep watching and to view additional episodes. That's what keeps me coming back for more.
B005OPTRW8,Steve Abbott,4,More of the same from the workaholics boys.  Silly antics with drug/alcohol/sexual themes.  Still surprised me how much I enjoyed it.
B005OV0LJA,Amazon Customer,4,Not one of my favorite episodes but it was still really good. It was interesting to see how things could've been.
B005OV0LJA,Leon Wechsler "LW",4,It is both a &#34;Soap Opera&#34; and a scientific glimpse in to the medical world.It is interesting yet some episodes are very tense.
B005OV0LJA,Me,5,LOVE the show and have yet to be disappointed!  Characters are true to themselves and so you have a real opportunity to get to know and love them.
B005OV0LJA,Readerease,5,I have watched Grey's Anatomy since it began and I love it. It is the one and only series I have followed. I am attached to the characters outcome and that is due to the fine writing in the show. Yes I know it is a soap opera and it is my &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; but it entertainment and I love it!
B005OV0LJA,rm,5,now this is a free show to watch and i am sooo happy about cause this is my all time favorite show and i am able to watch this show all the time because it is free were the others show you have to pay for you can not.
B005OV0LJA,S. Thiel "Sanpan",5,I didn't watch this when it was on TV. I don't even remember why since I really like it. After so many seasons you'd think it would get stale. It hasn't. I'm now watching the next season.
B005OV0LJA,txjaywalker,5,Since I'm addicted to Greys anatomy I enjoyed this season.  Continues to present interesting story lines both w/in the medical content as well as the personal story lines of the characters.
B005OV0LJA,William R. Smith "Bill Smith",5,There have been no episodes of Grey's Anatomy in which we have found faults. We are totally addicted. We prize character development over almost anything else. Grey's Anatomy is a winner.
B005P58OZ8,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,This is one of my favorite shows I watch it every week. Tom Selleck has never been better. Great action.
B005P58OZ8,carl,4,we liked it quite well. the discs were in good shape and we are ready to buy the next set.
B005P58OZ8,Donna K. Ford "English Mystery Collector",5,I have watched all of season 1 and am about to do the same for 2;  season 3 will be next.  I've gotten very involved with thesecharacters.  The family in this series is remarkable in that they observe family traditions and values but their lives can be flawedat imes.  The photos of New York that open each show make me feel like I'm there.  In short I love this series and will be verysorry for it to come to an end.
B005P58OZ8,L Daughtridge,5,Love anything with TomSelleck and having the Blue Bloods Series is so great and the copies I rec'd were good.
B005P58OZ8,Lindalee Ausejo,5,Some of the best acting on tv and very entertaining. I hope to get each of the seasons. I don't always stay up to watch it and so I purchase them.
B005P58OZ8,M. B. Feeser,5,This is truly a good show. It is more realisitic than alot of the older shows. Tom Selleck just seems to get better and better with age.
B005P58OZ8,Shaun R. Moll,5,I have enjoyed this series when it began last season and the second one is just as good!! Tom Selleck shines in this show!!
B005P58PIO,Charles K. Gorga,5,I ENJOYED THE MOVIE IT HELD MY INTEREST IT HAD A LOT OF ACTION. THE ACTORS PLAYED THERE ROLLS VERY WELL AND ARE VERY GOOD LOKING.
B005P58PIO,Leafsfan2028,2,Another full year of Nikita and Percy playing cat and mouse. The ongoing chase becomes boring and predictable. If these folks are so highly trained and skilled how is it they cannot finish a job? This becomes laughable and greatly annoying.
B005P58PIO,MVP,5,Of course this show is addictive. There's no way I could stop watching this. It gets better by the minutes. Great production and script.
B005P58PIO,ROY,5,The second season was more exciting than the first and to see how she takes on all villians  wow wouldn't want to meet her in a dark alley...Everyweek it was another action packed story..Can't wait to see season three when she takes over the office
B005P58PIO,Tori Stegle,5,This is an awesome TV Show!  The best version of Nikita I think!  The CW was genius to pick this up.  Season 2 ended well but Season 3 was pretty crazy and ended so sad!  So I cannot wait for Season 4.
B005PK4YNO,djdave,5,This was always my favorite CSI show. I will miss future seasons of this franchise. David had some heart for his character.
B005PK4YNO,D. Moore "Dano",5,One more reason to can the Cable TV.. And I did.. I got all the TV shows I want on DVD....And CSI Miami is one of them.. I can now watch it from A-Z....I will miss CSI Miami..
B005PK4YNO,Evelyn Reichardt,5,Miss show very much.  Liked this the best.  The cast was always bright and cheerful and the individual character studies were great to watch.
B005PK4YNO,J3F,4,Best season that has the crew come together.  Well-oiled machine.  More action in the beginning.  The boundaries of all the team has been reached as far as growth goes and they maximize each of their potential to solve crimes.  Awesome special guests from current shows and also living divas like Raquel Welsh and Bo Derek.  Season opener was awesome and it gives that perception that Horatio could die. . .I particular thought the Finale ending was what its all about at the end of the day.  You go home and know that your family is there.  Definitely a family oriented viewpoint versus the &#34;all out big bang&#34;.Personal note:  Taylor Cole added the extra umph to Season 10.
B005PK4YNO,Lindalee Ausejo,5,I love this series and now have all the seasons. Thank you for the prompt delivery. I will miss this series.
B005PK4YNO,michaelaen_37841,5,I Collect all the CSI and CSI Miami is one of my favorites I don't know why they took it of but the is the final season of miami so it was a must too.
B005PK4YNO,movie lover "jean",4,Have not had a chance to view it yet as I ordered many new DVD's but it appears as described
B005PK4YNO,nelly123,5,This is a great series to watch they are a great team I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 18 years
B005PK4YNO,Penny,5,So sad that Miami Vice has seen it's last season.  These programs was great entertainment.  David Caruso and the other stars were perfect in their parts.  Good storylines that kept me interested in coming back week and week.
B005PK4YNO,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I got an email today saying that CSI Miami has offically been cancelled. The reason behind this decision is that the series was expensive to film. It still is one of my favorite shows and will be missed by fans.
B005PK4ZHY,Laura,5,This is a sad day when there are no more desperate housewives on Sunday nights. I always looked forward to watching them but at least I can watch whenever I want since I have the season.
B005PK4ZHY,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,ngtkl;jrgsh'tldfk lsdfmkhgk lknfgh lkjfgnh'lk kdfngh'lkn sfdngylekn lkjtdhlk lkthtk lksdhyklt klfntuhl;rkj lskdfhlk;j lkrftghlk lk'srthlk sfkhlk lkngtrhlk fghklnlk sgkjhbkj lkrlkhk rlkhjlk sdflghkj
B005PK4ZHY,NY rat "+",5,This was as good as season 1!!! I snoozed a bit in season 7 yet this one i couldn't put down. Great. Just great! Episode 17 broke my heart. I thought they did a great job with this season and the final episode. It is on the edge of your seat kinda season.  It was a great show if tears come up when it's about to be over.
B005PK4ZHY,The Big G. Spot "The Big G. Spot",5,She now has all 8 season and she love to watch them one of her all time favorite tv series'. She is totally bummed that they ended it. But at least she can watch them all now when she wants and with out commercials.
B005PK5KP0,Here in ocean city "Melissa",5,Definately one of my favorite historical doc. Watch it over and over good job and thanks mr burns. Look forward to your next doc.
B005PK5KP0,I. Behling,5,The Probition was put into perspective as we watched this outstanding film.  Ken Burns has such a gift for this!  We once again learned many new things from watching a Ken Burns film.  If only we could all learn from the past...
B005PK5KP0,Savy Shopper,5,Very informative.  I knew it was the temprance movement that started it all but I didn't that Temprance & Suffragetes were so closely linked.I knew some of this first hand because I have uncles that have now passed that lived in upper New York & would visit their Canadian cousins by boat with their boats empty & come back with their boats filled to capacity with Canadian liquor.  The stories have been passed down.
B005PK5KP0,Soloporfe,5,I had not heard that much about the intermix of politics and conviction that led to the rise and demise of prohibition.  I appreciate the film's attempt to provide an overview of these issues.
B005PK5KP0,Terri,5,I found it interesting to see sort of a timeline of prohibition since I didn't live through that time.  Found many parallels that seem applicable to today in the debate over legalizing marijuana.  Gave a nice perspective of the times.
B005PK5KP0,Toni Eco,4,The 3 part series is very thorough and provides a lot of information that I believe is overlooked when reviewing this topic. The celebrity voice overs were great too.
B005PK5OEM,Judith A. Kling "JKling",3,The final show was just so so. No suspense or drama. Easy to complete. Was surprised when they headed to the mat so early.
B005PK5OEM,Todd,5,Never knew The Amazing Race was so much fun to watch. Been having a lot of fun with my kids watching this!
B005PKNIO0,By Ericka C.,5,Can't stop watching...Incredible !! This is a must see if you like to watch IRT !!  HONESTLY INCREDIBLE DRIVING EVER!
B005PKNIO0,Diatom,3,It starts out okay but then seems to get bogged down with a lot of &#34;drama&#34;. Why are these people risking their lives like this?
B005PKNIO0,juan,5,I think few truck drivers will have the guts to drive these roads.  The margin of error is very slim.  Your life is in danger every inch of the way.  I admire these people.
B005PKNIO0,Terry Draper,5,First time I've seen Hugh out of Canada/Alaska.  Some one must be paying him big bucks to drive a truck over these llama trails!I guess the end of the series could be set in Antarctica.
B005PKQDXI,DonnaSays "Amazon makes my Life easy!",5,I just finished watching this and I'm sad it's no longer on. I would of watched this for years. The acting the script the scenery and the wardrobe. I was hooked the first episode. It's a refreshing show to watch. It was much more in depth than expected! I loved the characters the actors made me feel like I knew them and they got me involved with each one!
B005PUXH3W,Another opinion,5,I just discovered this show by accident with the season 3 finale on CW.  I loved the show show so much I had to get the DVDs for past seasons.  All the actors are entertaining and charming.  It's a great show.
B005PUXH3W,June,5,I love it. I live in the south & it is just like how I grew up. It's a great cast. Hope it come back for another season or more.
B005T5N0MQ,926 Daytripper "926daytripper",5,I am hooked on the whole series. Can not wait for the next season to view. Very well done and extremely informative.
B005T5N0MQ,B. Lyn,4,Interesting viewpoints are presented that I hadn't thought of before; some seem to be a stretch but it gets you thinking!
B005T5N0MQ,Debra Cook,5,I like this show a lot because it makes you think and use a lot of brain power.  It also brings up alternative information most being things that the average person never hears.  It is very interesting!  I would recommend this show to all of my friends and associates.
B005T5N0MQ,Joey Abbott,5,I love the stories they bring to say &#34;what if&#34;. It just gives new ideas on the questions they bring. I love the mystery and the stories that is brought behind each episode.
B005T5N0MQ,JustaDude,4,This is basically an anti - conspiracy show which is refreshing out of all the pro-conspiracy type of entertainment out there.There are some episodes that I feel are a little light on the details but overall a decent show
B005T5N0MQ,kathleen capela,5,I wish there were more seasons to watch I really liked the show and would watch a season three if they came out with one
B005T5N0MQ,pd,1,These are worst bunch of goobers on TV. Brad stays home and proves Mount Rushmore is a racist plot and Lincoln was gay. The minions stumble around the country to try to prove his inane theories.
B005TEZV74,fatguyinalilcoat "cartman_98",5,I don't know what these others are complaining about. The show still has every episode pertaining to a football agenda. To me this season went the furthest with the pranks and jokes. I watch this OVER and OVER again due to the funniest episodes are all in this season. Also has most cameos in this season. If there is one to buy it is this one.
B005TEZV74,Joey Abbott,5,It's definitely probably one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time. The characters are well defined and I watched the entire season in a  day. Highly recommend the show.
B005TEZV74,Randy S. Milliron "Randune23",5,This is a much watch because you can probably identify with the various characters in the show and think of someone you have in your league.  This is not a show to watch with the family (some crude references).But it is a must-see.Randy
B005TPRNGA,Altecian,4,I thought season one was fantastic season two was good three kind of left me asking why I even bothered. Season 4 however picked up and was a little more fun this time around!!!
B005TPRNGA,DeDe "DeDe",5,Love this show... plot lines get better and better. Acting is first rate.  I did think some of the backdrops in some of the outdoor scenes this season looked like they had had some budget cuts.  Once scene on the tarmac at the airport- the palm trees and bright blue sky looked liked a large hanging canvas painted on.  But I don't watch this show for the backdrops- I watch it for the fascinating premise and genius of the web being woven and slowly revealed.  It takes me away from the reality of our very stressful day to day life and I can just be entertained.  Looking forward to many more episodes/seasons.
B005TPRNGA,DIANNA,4,THE SACTUARY AFTER SEASON 2 THE STORY LINES AREN'T AS GOOD TO ME BUT IT COULD BE JUST A PREFERENCE.
B005TPRNGA,E. Helms,4,Very different sci-fi / fantasy concept. Good actors and they worked hard to make you believe the fantasy. Fun for the sci-fi fix. I appreciate they provided us fans with closure instead of just ending the series.
B005TPRNGA,Johanna Wiese,5,That the SyFy channel would cancel such a great series? Amanda Tapping brought a whole new way of tapping a series. The green screen effect was brilliant and it brought out the best in all the actors. You would have never known there was a green screen in most (if not all) the shots as the series was shot. What great innovation!!!
B005TPRNGA,Kindle Customer,4,If you have a feeling of deja vu watching this episode it is because the same abnormal was the villain in the Sanctuary Season 1 episode called Kush. In this episode there is more than one trapped with a second Sanctuary team. The first team killed each other. Now the second team is falling prey to hallucinations while trying to find the abnormals and subdue them. There is a lot of unnecessary carnage before the episode comes to an end.  Watch Kush before you watch this episode and you will see they are matching bookends.
B005TPRNGA,lremick,5,The fourth season was great! Just like the television series but without the commercials and pop-ups. The commentaries were great. I just wish the people that make decisions would have ended it differently.
B005TPRNGA,Lynn McBee,5,This series has had us hooked from the start. Love sci-fi and this meets our needs. The cinematography is excellent. So enjoy the special effects that they create as well as all the abnormals (really broad definition). We recommend this series whole heartedly to those that love the unusual.
B005TPRNGA,Pulpman,5,I was very satisfied with the way the show ended. It ended on the right note. I will not give it away but the series was starting to waffle in it's direction. It was back on track in the end and the last episodes tied up a lot of loose ends and I felt it was finished. Those who have collected the sets all along will enjoy it. I just finished a marathon sessoin of the complete 4 seasons and feel it was time well spent.
B005TPRNGA,ROY,5,This season was really great to see all the strange things that the team had to take care and secure in the Sanctuary US..Hopfully there will be a fifth season as this season (4) left to hanging as to what will happen next..
B005TPRNGA,Scott Solomon,5,I bought all the seasons of this show. I love the show and its creativity. Too bad the unintelligent executives decided to cancel the show. This seems to be a current theme. Idiots canceling wonderful shows.
B005TPRNGA,setzco,5,Its too bad this series ended so soon I enjoyed all 4 seasons and thought it could have gone on for sometime.  All in all a very good show.
B005UKJW5O,Cheryl Carter "cartec",3,I was very impressed with the organizers of the show.  They selected teams that kept the excitement a nd the drama going.  I was behind the black couple until they demonstrated  bigotry and prejudice against the two Muslims who were also participating.  They did not start their hate campaign until the Muslims began to become a threat to win the race.  They made matters worse by spreading their feelings to two other teams.  They behaved badly and should be ashamed of themselves.  They highly educated and black they should understand what hatred can do to people.  I gave the program three stars because they allowed it to continue.
B005UKJW5O,Lurch,5,A great excitement and travel bundle laid in your lap.  We never miss a season it is always fun to see where and what they have to do next.  Sometimes the gripeing and fighting gets annoying but hey the rest if fun.  Give it a try and get ready for some excitement
B005UKK9YC,Carol,4,Love a movie with a twist!!  Never know what's going to happen. The movie has a surprise ending that has you saying &#34;What the heck?&#34;
B005UVNEIE,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,Some consider themselves well informed but it is shows like this that remind you of the important role media should inform educate it the true purpose of the 5th estate.
B005UVNEIE,Honey Solomon,4,The documentation of the Anthrax Files pose a question that remains unanswered. More than anything else it leaves the viewer with questions about the techniques used during the investigation. Coincidence is not proof positive and neither is supposition. Political urgency and faulty investigation lead one to wonder why other avenues were not pursued.  Accurate information presented within the scope of a documentary.
B005UVNEIE,Laval A. Thibodeau "mr.t.",5,If you want know about current events in a cogent manner this is the series&#34; go to&#34;series. This series seems to get it right-not some of the time but ALL the time. The content can sometimes be almost TOO powerful to accept and nevertheless I am draw to it.
B005UVNEIE,Penelope Penworthy,5,I loved the in-depth research that was presented in this program.  I plan to watch more of Frontline in the weeks ahead.
B005UVNEIE,V. Aub,5,I am a documentary junkie so its hard for me not to give this show a good review. Good Work!
B005VA7M2I,Alison G. Jones "babybear",5,good idea with the chance for castaways to return to the game even when they get voted out the first time.
B005VA7M2I,BHoward,4,My husband and I started watching survivor out of simple boredom and never knew we would get soooooo hooked! LOVE IT!
B005VA7M2I,JB,5,Overall a very entertaining season. There were several stand-out characters and big moves. I highly recommend watching this season for any fan of the show.
B005VA7M2I,Jeni,5,I was never a big fan of Boston Rob and I never cared for Russell Hantz. the both of them is what made this season of Survivor so exciting. I couldn't wait to see what happened next and I never expected Boston Rob to do as well as he did. He played a terrific game!
B005VA7M2I,K. Robertson,1,Great set of players but the introduction of former &#34;stars&#34; tainted it greatly. Boston Rob showed the world what true lies and deceit can do. This made me see the show no longer as a game but as real life played out.
B005VA7M2I,racergal,5,I am a huge survivor fan. This wasn't my favorite season but it does have some of my old favorites back on it. There is the same scheming and maneuvering going on. Boston Rob is on so how can this not be great!
B005VA7M2I,Wilson Family,4,Quite a show.  Certainly illustrates how a strong leader can dominate a small group and slowly eliminate all their competition and then throw loyalists under the bus.  Masterful play of a game that celebrates and rewards the worst in people.
B005W8IKCU,Gary R. Jordan,3,I found the show entertaining..Stories were suspenseful..Acting was very good.The real life persons were believable.
B005W8IKCU,Granny123go,5,There is nothing like watching this show at night with all of the lights out and in front of a fire in the fireplace.
B005W8IKCU,jks1980,5,This a great series on the A&E Bio network. If your a fan of ghost reality tv this a great series!
B005W8IKCU,Maximilian K. Biltz,5,Though not as good as &#34;A Haunting&#34; it still presents some very eerie and good ghost stories. Better than the &#34;live&#34; and fake ghost hunter shows.
B005W8IKCU,Robert Miller,4,I like it better than an overnight lock down with ghost hunters which can become tiresome and boring at times.
B005W8IKCU,Sandra Martinez,4,Being someone who has had their own experiences with things that just can't be reasonably explained & who believes there is something more after our time on this earth is through...I LOVE THIS SHOW! There were some stories that the evidence blew me away & others that the people seemed to be grasping at straws. I guess it's all a matter of personal belief.
B005W8IKCU,Tech Ed "Tech Ed",4,I have watched and reviewed the previous two seasons and I think that everything I said about them still applies to season 3. I did notice some changes in the format or presentation of the individual segments. Perhaps it was time to &#34;freshen  up&#34; the episodes.
B005WGBBS2,Elisa Bohanan,5,My daughter loves this show.  She is almost two and has been watching it the past six months or so.  I think I have seen every episode 50 times at least!  It teaches spanish and that taking care of animals is important.  I don't recommend showing it to your toddler unless you are prepared to watch it a million times.
B005WGBBS2,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,My three year old grandson loves Diego. I appreciate the availability and ease of this format. It makes it easy to play whenever we want.
B005WGBBS2,KAM,5,Diego has helped my daughter to realize some significant animal characteristics.  She always looks forward to going forward in watching more episodes!
B005WGBBS2,Kristin L. Weiner,5,My boys age 3 and 5 Love Diego! They were super excited to have a new season added. Very educational...my boys know all kinds of interesting facts about animals and the world.
B005WGBBS2,Linda Wilson,5,My granddaughter is a fan of Go Diego when she comes to my house she asks to watch it.  She is 3 1/2 and will sit through the whole show. she likes the adventure shows
B005WM5R40,.fgd,3,Not badly acted. Script and tension building work . I love the ever pervading atmosphere of an ancient labaryntine New York  apartment complex. One huge apartment anonymous and lost but strangely still in the consciouness of wierd or irate neighbours is very creepy although a faithful attentive doorman presides.The tenant has been advised to squat the apartment in order to uphold a very cheap rental agreement from grand-mother until it goes to court. Meanwhile tenant is mysteriously intimidated.Now this is supposed to be film probably on the paranormal. But ruined by a soon apparent wacking great hole in the back of a wall with a large space going up and down the side of the building....yes  a miscief-maker hired by a determined landlord could well be entering the apartment  which kills off the spooky side of the film.Secondly if the tenant can get the doorman to hire and let in an exterminator then he sure can let in a builder to cover said wacking great hole. There other hole is in the cognitive frontal lobe of the producer to miss this.
B005WM5R40,jonoknee,4,a movie that continues to have a spin on suspense and keeps you glued to the tube. I liked this movie and recommend watching it.John.H
B005YJ8ZR2,Michael Chen,4,I enjoyed it.  It was nice and short and the sequences of the movie were climatic at points.  Setup of the shots and design were unusual for Anime...looked a little like screenshots here and there.
B005YJ8ZR2,Seven,4,This is a great X story. If anyone knows how the Japanese imagine their heroes and how the approach this genre then you get that flavor here. Great anime and good story. We should have more!!
B005YJ8ZR2,Yar,5,this is a great story arch. animation is nice i have never seen this before amazon got it.  love it
B0061IMTYK,Boulder Mike,4,Great show. One of my favorite reality shows. They added 2 sites to a total of 3 sites somewhere in the 2nd season. Results in a nice flow with lots of characters.
B0061IMTYK,debby,5,5 starskeeping the faith that they might all get richI like how they work there way thru all the trials and tribulations would definetly recommend this show
B0061IMTYK,Lurch,4,Good not great.  Great to kill time and see how much work goes into digging gold but to much drama for me.  I get tired of the battles and problems that happen every show.
B0061IMTYK,RayInLV,5,Along with some others I have not watched yet it is one of the big reasons I like Amazon Prime.  Just wish we could watch shows one after another without intervention between.
B0062246R8,Kelly Carlton,5,these are so much fun to watch. they are entertaining as well as educational and Julia is such an icon.I've had girlfriends over twice now to watch the shows and we love it.
B006224I3U,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",5,Old as I am it astonished me that Julia Child was making cooking shows while I was still in high school.  The early programs are in black and white with minimal production values to put it nicely.  This adds to the charm of the show for me though.  Good food has changed a lot since the days when French cooking reigned supreme.  Today's emphasis on the best and freshest ingredients and simple preparation contrasts with Julia's substantial preparation efforts.  It's fun to watch what it was like to cook Julia style.
B00627P604,Mamaya706,5,It is so convenient to be able to watch this on my phone. I love this show and am so glad that amazon offers it especially free with my prime membership.
B00627P604,S. Highley "Mr. Frugality",5,Every season of "Malcolm In the Middle" is great!And sometimes the best influence you can have on your kids is to show them a really BAD role model.  It draws the line between acceptable and unacceptable so much better than just looking at good role models.
B00627ULUO,Babbs,5,this is absolutely the best &#34;cop&#34; series i have ever watched even if it is an oder series.  thanks for offering it!
B00627ULUO,Edna M. Dooley "Doolster",5,Plots constantly change with all kinds of crimes they have to investigate and come up with novel ways to solve.
B00627ULUO,KMC,5,Every weekly episode has two or three stories that you must follow. Each story stands on its own merits and you definitely need to watch NYPD Blue.
B00627ULUO,sharon kemm,5,look forward to watching each episode. the shows offer a lot. certainly enjoy sipowicz. danny franz is an outstanding actor. he takes his job seriously but not as serious as most. you have to watch and you'll see.
B00627UN0C,Debbie Dillon,5,I watched all 11 seasons  and loved them all. I had forgotten much about the show but I enjoyed seeing it again.
B00627UN0C,LaVonne Hauwiller,5,We really enjoyed this whole series. Sorry there are all done.We decided to watch something else now.  We miss the characters fromNYPD BLUE.
B00627UN0C,linda21,5,Which it was still on love SipowirZ and its additive whatched all the episodes in two months its funny cause its so old
B00627UPDM,Babbs,5,I didn't watch this when it was actually airing but am enjoying the program now.  To me it is one of best TV programs about the lives of city officers I have seen.
B00627UPDM,Edna M. Dooley "Doolster",5,This is one of the best shows I have ever watched. Every episode ends and I cannot wait until I watch the next one. You get very involved with the characters and all of their problems and cases. I have watched from season one and it gets better as it goes. Especially Dennis Franz. He is a great actor.
B00627UPDM,Evelyn Reichardt,5,The best ensemble of actors in a cop drama.  Love Andy Sipowicz.  Television has never been the same since NYPD is longer on TV.
B00627UPDM,HeMeGrrrr,3,I do enjoy the characters & their storylines. But the soap opera drama leads rather than weekly plots played out- I like the smaller investments rather than having to recall the character's history. I like the shorter plots rather than watching how the big picture arc storylines play out.
B00627UX7U,Jenny,5,This may not be true to life but it goes pass the crime and deals with the personal stuff that comes up in everyday life.The actors are great.....
B00627UX7U,KMC,5,My wife and I cannot say enough good things about NYPD Blue season 9. We both look forward to the next series. Take a chance if you've never watched NYPD it will captivate you and keep you tuned in.
B00627UX7U,LaVonne Hauwiller,5,I can't believe we are now on season 11!  We hate to see the series end after season 12!It is wonderful not to have commercials.
B00627UX7U,Linda K. Holman,5,This is a very suspenceful and captivating show.  It is well worth the watch.  Watch all nine seasons.  Start with Sesoson zone .
B00627UX7U,Pamela S. Halbig,3,All the episodes are real good. I recommend watching all 12 seasons.
B00627V4UU,Darlene Walker,5,I really love this show!!  The characters are great and the storyline is taken from real life!!!!! Would recommend this show to anyone who loves cop shows.
B00627V4UU,D. K. Peel "jstkdn",5,I never got a chance to watch it while I was working but now that I'm retired it is one of the best shows out there today.
B00627V4UU,D. Moore "Dano",1,Great Cop show. NO SDH.. NO CC. For the hard of hearing... When Shout takes over. 90% of the time theyleave out the CC are SDH... Just cheap..And the people that have seasons 1-4 that have CC & SDH on them. Are now out of luck...From season 5 on..Thanks to cheap Shout..
B00627V4UU,Duffer513,5,After almost 20 years watching this series is as entertaining as it was originally.  Many shows after a period of time seem a little silly because they are dated and the subject matter has become trite.  This series watches the same as it did when first aired and is still as entertaining!
B00627V4UU,DY "Music City Hiker",5,The rhythm & percussion of NYPD and the great stories keep my mind off the &#34;work&#34; in my aerobic workout. One episode is the right length.
B00627V4UU,Evelyn Reichardt,5,Great Cast real Life Stories Andy never seems to be a happy camper  Love the New York Scenery  Great Police Show
B00627V4UU,Justicried,5,I love the humor between Sorensen and Sipowitz.  It gets better every episode.I think it helps Andy to "father" Sorensen.  Also I loved the reference to his cousin Jekyll by Diane.  Not to mention all the potshots they take at psychiatric evaluations of the criminals.
B00627V4UU,Kim,5,Great show for a detective drama based tv series. Good humor and good story lines. I will be watching all the prime tv episodes that are available.
B00627V4UU,LaVonne Hauwiller,5,This show continues to keep us interested.  We try and watch a few episodes most nights. It reminds me of a soap opera.I love being retired! So does my husband.
B00627V4UU,linda21,5,Love the show wish it was still on liked it when it aired in 2001 enjoying it more nowMaybe cause its funny and so old
B00627V4UU,Louis Diana,5,It's sad that you can't catch up on one of the greatest police dramas of all time anywhere on TV.
B00627V4UU,Norm F.,5,Well scripted and acted.  Never a dull moment.  One of the best series ever on television...but only if you like police and action themes.
B00627V4UU,sharon kemm,5,while filming this season- 911 happened. I was stunned at what happened to danny Sorenson. I wanted to see more of his character. after losing simone-this was too sudden. new characters emerged and were good too and the flow continued. still made me want to see more.
B0063ONN9C,Amazon Customer "&#34;Insert snazzy catchphra...,3,My daughter keeps asking to watch season 1 again even though we have season 2....not sure what that's about. The writing seems as vapid as usual to me. Whatever....
B0063ONN9C,DDeyton,5,Our 14 month old absolutely loves it!!! Hums the theme song all day long!
B0063ONN9C,Erin "sneimraej",5,The songs are catchy and the characters and stories are super cute.  We are totally on the guppy train in this house :)
B0063ONN9C,JC,5,My child loves this show.  It's great to watch them interact and learn.  I totally recommend it for any pre-schoolers
B0063ONN9C,Micelle Parker,5,This is a fun show. My 2 year old granddaughter loves it. She has learned things from it and loves to &#34;sing&#34; and dance with the guppies.
B0064JGWZS,author of Not a Ghost of a Chance "author of ...,4,Finally the technical problems are resolved!SPOILERS:Chaos reigns in Hell on Wheels. Just desserts are delivered to the Swede. Rewards and loses come to others. While Bohannan's guilt and rage lead him to go too far.
B0064JGWZS,Barbara G. Michonski,5,I have watched many westerns with my Dad and this is one of the best! It tells about the beginning of the railroad and how the people have lived besides the main story about a Civil War Veteran that is looking for revenge toward the men that killed his wife and son. I can not wait for Season 3 to start on Aug. 10th!!
B0064JGWZS,Carolyn Amos,5,I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show.
B0064JGWZS,D. R. Roberts,5,Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!
B0064JGWZS,James A. Moore "Jim",5,Historical value. I've actually sent history students home to watch this one. Even the weapons are well thought out for this series.
B0064JGWZS,J. Griffiths,5,Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it.
B0064JGWZS,Kathy A.,5,This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting.
B0064JGWZS,Lisa K. Sedlmeier,5,A colleague recommended I check out this series and I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story - very different from what is on TV right now.  I will order the second season as well and try to catch the third season when it's on TV.  This was reasonably priced and a great way to be introduced to the series.
B0064JGWZS,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,I loved this series on AMC! I preorder this as soon as it became available. It does suck one of my friends that played a Native American on the show had to get killed put it is what it is. If you haven't seen it.. do! It's really great! Highly recommend!
B0064JGWZS,millerj,5,This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now.
B0064JGWZS,O. Vaughn "Movie Fan",5,I love this series and had to have the discs. I plan to watch this many times over. Go Hell on Wheels!
B0064JGWZS,Warren Johnson "Warren the Camera Guy",4,Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or "the old west" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!
B0064YPHEK,David K.,1,Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature.
B0064YPHEK,D. M. Garland,5,What a great series!  I will watch it again and again.  One photographer dug a four foot by four foot pit and lived in it for seven months to get a shot of Siberian tigers!  It's a great series.
B0064YPHEK,E. Yeager,4,The nature series is very entertaining while enlightening and does pass on a lot of knowledge. This series should be in curriculums in elementary school.
B0064YPHEK,L. Grant,5,I love Nature but do not have cable TV or a local PBS station to watch so I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime but sadly not a lot of episodes.  Hope they add more at some point.
B0064YPHEK,loveinthemist,5,it is just great nature show...heads above those on animal planet and other channels similar such as discovery etc.  watch it
B0064YPHEK,readinglarge,5,The particular episode I watched about odd animal friends was so heartwarming and so different to see animals grow up together that would usually be enemies.sometimes it's like humans if you aren't yet taught to hate you don't know you aren't supposed to be friends.
B0064YPHEK,S. Hewitt,5,I like this series. Each episode is interesting and some of them are downright fun! They're not controversial at all.
B0064YPMOU,Amazon Customer,5,I was still in High School when that war ended for the US but had some recollection of events both in the classroom and newspapers and broadcasts.  I also have an older brother who served two tours there.  This was an amazing piece of documentary work.  Both the visual content and narration was amazing.  I really can;t say enough about this series.  Watch it.
B0064YPMOU,BM3,5,This was an excellent series and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this war and the struggles our Soldiers and country faced.
B0064YPMOU,John P. Bradford "Angelophile",4,A very good albeit short history of the Vietnam war.  Some not before seen footage.  Worth a watch.
B0064YPMOU,Kbaby59,5,Very well done. The film footage show a lot of what was happening and took me back to the way things were.
B0064YPMOU,Kevin Curtis,4,This  series should be required viewing for any politician that wants to get the US  into another war.  Very moving sequences and personal  experiences.  Some of the footage was shown repeatedly.
B0064YPMOU,mompantero,4,This is an older program that aired some time back.  It provides a good and accurate summary of the history and politics of the Vietnam war.
B0064YPMOU,S. Mansfield,5,Well written and documented with very good images.  It took me back to 1969 very quickly and my time there.
B0064YPMOU,Steve P,4,I grew up during this war and remember watching some of the things mentioned during tv newscasts. I am not sure how exact it is historically but I feel like it was a good representation of the series of events that happened during this time period in American history
B0064YPMOU,Vic Graninger,5,This is a greats series. It gives the viewers insights into the minds of the young men and women who served and fought in the Viet Nam war. I am a history buff and study a lot about this period in American history (my father served in Viet Nam in 1966).
B0064YPSRG,Michael Kerjman,3,A hardly memorized movie of a not-so-bad looking guy avoiding sexual encounters while a story is about his choices as he was accused in making one pregnant during a one night stay.Not much at all.
B0064YPSRG,Ron Stultz "Zenster",4,Nice little romantic "comedy". One of those where things just go from bad to worse and one has to shake one's head. Liked both main characters and think they did decent acting jobs. Could be a data movie for 25 - 30's.  Recommend as entertainment.
B00669UD0Q,Raven "Raven",4,It focuses on a group of people who hike into the mountains and find a young girl buried under the ground... alive... they dig her out and try to get her to safety... TRY is the key word... someone is hunting them.
B0066SB8UQ,Amazon Customer,5,You really can't go wrong with the Green Lantern Corps at all. Like to see this animated series do well and continue to evolve.
B0066SB8UQ,Arthur Gooch,4,keep the story  going  the rumor is your going to end the show after this season. that would be less than smart
B0066SB8UQ,Mike,4,Really good series it's like a cartoon version of the movie but deeper the animation is also done well with good scripts and voices it give you a closer look on how green lantern is and the enemies he comes in contact with.
B0066SB8UQ,Sunshine247365,4,I love being able to share some of my comic book heroes with my son who is 9 years old. Of course he thinks I should give it a 5 star review.
B0068ZCCA2,Alison G. Jones "babybear",5,as always - great twists & turns and great challanges - never gets old to watch people being so sneaky.
B0068ZCCA2,BHoward,5,My husband and I just started watching this show because it was on Prime.  We are hooked to the whole series!!  Best long running reality tv!
B0068ZCCA2,His Beloved,4,I am glad I didn't have to wait from week to week to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable to watch from the comforts of my home.
B0068ZCCA2,Jeni,5,I really love the Survivor series. I like how they switched up the tribes; older and younger. It's kind of unfair to separate young vs. old but Survivor isn't about being fair and it was entertaining to watch.
B0068ZCCA2,Joyce M.,5,Watching Boston Rob play Survivor is amazing!  A lot of crazy characters on this season makes it so much fun to watch!
B0068ZCCA2,mlsigner "mlsigner",5,Always enjoy watching survivor. Jeff has kept the adventures intriguing. Recommend all seasons that are currently available. Watch and enjoy.
B0068ZCCA2,Paula S. Smith "ChefPaula1965",4,This is a fun show to watch with young teen agers. We enjoyed it and watched some of the episodes together.
B0068ZCCA2,racergal,5,I will always give survivor 5 stars! I am a fan since the very first season like a lot of people! Some seasons are better than others but I have never found a season I didn't like!
B0068ZCCA2,trixie,5,BEST REAL TV SERIES YET.
B0068ZCCA2,Value Shopper Pensacola,4,I didn't get a chance to watch this series when it was on network tv.  But I have enjoyed watching it on Amazon especially since there aren't any commercials.
B0068ZCCA2,Wilson Family,5,I haven't watched Survivor much because it seems to bring out the worst in people.  Did make an exception and watched this season to see if anything had changed and was glad to see that the most deserving person won.  Congrats to all the survivors and well played.
B006DUK1K0,Craig S. Werner "The Grumpy Old Squid",4,I watched this not knowing what to expect.  I found it entertaining and telling a story of life in a french brothel at the turn of the century.  It turned out better than I expected when I first started watching it.
B006DUK1K0,Donna Curtis,1,I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections.
B006DUK1K0,Douglas Tyler,3,I have not watched this performance I it's entirety.  Interesting watching movie with sub titles.  Intend on seeing whole movie.
B006DUK1K0,ilikebooks,1,This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time.
B006DUK1K0,Jimmy C. Saunders "Papa Smurf",3,Very slow moving plot if there is one.  Trying to tell to many stories and really not showing anything really grabs you.
B006DUK1K0,Louis V. Borsellino,1,Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer.
B006DUK1K0,mompantero,2,A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!
B006DUK1K0,Virgil F. Keller,3,The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging.
B006DUK1K0,Wimpy Charley "Wimpy",5,It is best movie in long time.  I loves the history and always learn something that I haven't hear or learn in the past.
B006DUK6SM,1farstar,4,"It's takes a village to raise a child."  Everyone could have made a difference before it was too late if they had chosen to do so.Movies Message:  We all have choices everyday in our own "villages".
B006DUK6SM,KOBAM,5,Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray.
B006FKSSOY,Amazon Customer,4,While I may find the care bears just a tad annoying my daughter loves this show. What am I to do?
B006FKSSOY,Christa Douglas,5,It's Care Bears! My kids love them and it has several episodes so your not sorting through Dvd's looking for other episodes
B006FKSSOY,E. Yeager,5,This is a great show for babysitting. It keeps the young children entertained while teaching values. I recommend it to everyone.
B006FKSSOY,Gram,5,Care Bears is a very colorful show that has a lesson for the kids to learn. My grandson really likes for me to play them on my kindle for him.
B006FKSSOY,JCraul,5,My daughter loves the care bears and these cartoons are very cute.  Nothing scarey him them and the animation is way better than the ones I grew up with.
B006FKSSOY,Rich,5,This is not the care a lot I grew up with but they are still very cute and the message is always positive. This is a great show to let your kids watch.
B006FKSSOY,Rubydoo67,5,My 3 yo adores this updated classic. Theme song is required singing :). A classic that still teaches valuable lessons. Great pic too
B006FKSSOY,vickie,5,The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wantedmore and more
B006FTBWXY,Alice,4,Nice to watch Family and also you learn from it. A four some language not appropriate.. improve for kids to watch they are our future...
B006FTBWXY,Bet and Net "tiltv",5,The show is still pretty cool. Like learning about all the stuff that comes into the shop. Clean for the family.
B006FTBWXY,bruce,4,Unlike the ever predictable theme of every Rocky movie that came out these guys are doing the same thing all the time but have fresh stuff to show you at each show.
B006FTBWXY,Bryan,5,Love this show. I enjoy all the history you learn about a object and not to mention how much some stuff goes for.
B006FTBWXY,C. Sawyer,4,I always learn a lot about things that people bring in to sell.  There is a lot of history behind some of the items.  Always fun to watch.
B006FTBWXY,Debra Brodersen,5,I love the historical aspects of this show.  It is outrageously fun.  All of the personalities seem to work well together.
B006FTBWXY,Gerrob,5,I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments.
B006FTBWXY,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!
B006FTBWXY,JD GAYMAN,5,Love this season as I do all of their seasons. Chum lee and the guys are as always great. Love the new shop
B006FTBWXY,Jessica Balyeat,5,My family and I love this show and the staff.  We mainly watch it because of the history we learn about the artifacts.
B006FTBWXY,Laura,4,Please read my review of Volume 6.Not too much has changed.I reviewed #6 before #5 so the review process is backwards.This is an unusual series.Much like &#34;Antique Road Show&#34;but in a pawn shop.
B006FTBWXY,Lurch,5,Here is a vidio set that is so neat to think history is still in the hands of folks that don't always know what they have.  Fun and a great way to discover things about history you may have never known.
B006FTBWXY,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",5,chumlee is the star of the show. rick is the brains. their antic are almost as good as I love lucy. Plus you get and education as well.
B006FTBWXY,Moo,5,The is a very fun show. You just can't watch one. Great entertainment plus you always learn something as well.
B006FTBWXY,Mystery Shopper,5,Big Hoss is stepping it up to try and assert his place as a co-owner of the Pawn Shop.  Very interesting dynamics in a great setting with lots of interesting characters and items coming thru the doors.
B006FTBWXY,Randy,4,I enjoy this show very much.  It is interesting to watch the various items that come in for sale and the negotiations that take place between the seller and the pawn shop owners.  Some sellers over value their product while some under value their product and the pawn shop owners have to sort it out while trying to make a profit.  It is all very entertaining.
B006FTBWXY,Richard L Thompson,5,Very entertaining.  I think Chumlee is really cool.  The old man is hysterical.  They're all good.  Keep them coming. Voila!
B006FTBWXY,Ruby Chrisman,5,My whole family likes this show.  We love the different historical finds.  We like to know what an object is worth and what you can get monetarily from one.  The family chemistry is fun to watch.  We have recommended this show to our friends and family.
B006FTBWXY,Sam,1,The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television.
B006FTBWXY,simple,5,Viva Las Vegas! Where else would you find characters like this. Entertaining and educational with a bit of real life drama.
B006FTBWXY,skiarc,2,I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time.
B006FTBWXY,Tayrtot,5,We love watching this show. You learns something new about antiques and see what people have collected in their attics or cellars ~ that are worth some money! Makes you wish you'd kept some of those old items you tossed years ago :)
B006FTBWXY,Vicki Butcher,5,Fun to see what kind of things make it into a Pawn Store. The items are interesting as well as the people that bring in the items.The family dynamics are also entertaining
B006FYDKMA,Bill D. "Billy D.",5,Great way to pick up on some history and american culture.  This show will make you a better negotiator at yard sales.
B006FYDKMA,bruce,4,After all these years this show still amuses me in what they do. Every time I watch it I actually learn something. Its still as good as it was when it first started.
B006FYDKMA,Carla Beasley,5,I've watched seasons 1 - 4 so far and enjoyed them all.  Mike and Frank set up a friendly bantering when they are on the road.  It is fascinating to see the &#34;rusty gold&#34; that they find in some people's piles of junk.
B006FYDKMA,Chris Cummings,5,How absolutely cool it is to see inside the daily lives and jobs of three very cool people !and the treasures they find are more often the people they meet than the stuff they collect.
B006FYDKMA,David Seaquist,4,I almost feel like I am picking with them or at one of their stores. I enjoy learning about the pickers and their customers. It is fun to be told what an item was originally used for.
B006FYDKMA,ddddd,3,Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting.
B006FYDKMA,greg,5,This is a great consept for a show. I watch every episode i can. I like the way the guys treat everyone they meet.
B006FYDKMA,jatnj "Janet",5,Two childhood friends travel across America searching for the old and the unusual.  They take these items out of hiding and sell them in their store to other people who appreciate the history behind them.  Their enthusiasm for the history behind the items and their excitement in finding them is infectious.
B006FYDKMA,Kathleen Rowland,2,I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing.
B006FYDKMA,K. R. Merryman,5,Mike and Frank have great personalities and in-depth knowledge of antique junk! It's a junk history lesson on things I have thrown away. It's easy to get hooked on these episodes.
B006FYDKMA,Lilia,5,My husband and I enjoy American Pickers. This show captures audiences both old and young. Very diverse and entertaining. Funny!
B006FYDKMA,Lurch,5,The chase is on to a reality show that is fun and amazing in the search of America's lost treasures.  You will love it and a must for trivia and seakers of the past .
B006FYDKMA,Margaret L. Albright,5,I love American Pickers I have watched almost every episode at least once some several times. Started watching it the first season and would record it on the DVR.  Since we have had Amazon Prime we have watched all of those shows and the newer ones too. Appreciate not having to lose them after a year or so.  They are fun to review.
B006FYDKMA,Moo,5,Amazing show with both history and entertainment. The stuff they run into keeps you wondering what they will find next. Mike and Frank are great together and make the show flow.
B006FYDKMA,Mystery Shopper,5,I just get a kick out of watching these guy come up with treasures out of junk heaps.  They seem to have a knack for finding some real unusual characters along the way too.  I recommend this show to anyone.
B006FYDKMA,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,GREAT SHOW!!! MY BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SHOW& I LOVE IT.... SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED AMAZON &#34;PRIME&#34; (FREE) I SNAPED IT UP!!!!
B006FYDKMA,Sadie,5,Yay...love these guys and the people that they find. Always a good time filler!
B006FYDKMA,Sandra Seebers "Avid Reader",4,Mike and Frank have the best jobs in the world! I wish I could do what they do. They inspire me to do some picking.
B006FYDKMA,Scott T. Hall "AMG Metal",5,I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together.
B006FYDKMA,Victor1896 "movie addict",5,I really enjoy seeing the Pickers find some great stuff.  I bring back memorials and also gives you some history.
B006FYDKMA,Wendy L. Stivers,5,Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!
B006GM4JNU,Brooke Merry "bmerry",4,This might be the only Disney show that's actually worth watching.  It is very entertaining and has a nice range of characters.
B006GM4JNU,Kindle MomLKS,5,My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play nice and smooth over our Roku box.
B006GM4JNU,K.V.,5,This is a great show for kids. It is one that does not need to be reviewed. Your kids can just watch it.
B006GM4JNU,wdwenthusiast,5,I will cheerfully admit to being a childless adult that enjoys this show. Kids can't appreciate so much of what makes this show funny. The songs are great and so are the characters. I cannot recommend this show enough. It is truly creative and deserving of your time.
B006GM4K2A,Brian "batfan",5,This is by far my favorite Disney show.  I think it is very imaginative and smart.  My wife and I like it just as much as the kids do.
B006GM4K2A,Dave PA,5,If you like the show you'll love this Phineas and Ferb season. It's fun for the whole family... even grandma!
B006GM4K2A,Kindle MomLKS,5,My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play great over our Roku box.
B006GM4K2A,wdwenthusiast,5,I am a childless adult who was introduced to the show by a friend. It is genuinely funny and most episodes are memorable. The songs are great and the characters are strong. Kids can't really appreciate why it is so funny. Highly recommended.
B006H0602Y,John,5,Ron Eldard and the rest of the cast have a great movie here. So typical and excellent script. All the characterizations are dead-on.
B006I0GSZM,Annette Radocaj "Annette",3,This is a mediocre rendition of a Stephen King novel of the same name.It dragged a great deal and was more unpleasant than scary.A shame as the book was great
B006I0GSZM,Sharon,1,Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either.
B006I0GSZM,Ssloane,4,The story was a bit contrived but the acting excellent.  Always a surprise ending with Stephen King who leaves you hanging until the last.
B006LG7IJ8,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,3,The humor is clever but not funny for me personally. I get it but a big &#34;so what&#34; in my way of being. I prefer comedy which has me laughing out loud some of the time and holds my interest.
B006LWHBDA,Adele Dodd,3,I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.  It is okay for some people; there are better things to watch for entertainment.  My husband watches this stuff.  It is a waste of my money and my time.  Somethings shouldn't be aired more than once or twice and this is one of them.
B006LWHBDA,bruce,5,Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper.
B006LWHBDA,Chris St Pierre,4,I liked this season better than the others do far. Only a few into it but the players are comical
B006LWHBDA,Veronica V.,5,I love watching this show and seeing what treasures are found. I'm addicted and will watch to the very end.
B006LYWJR6,Evelyn Felice,5,An Australian chubby girl who dreams constantly of her wedding and the tricks and subterfuge so she was involved in in trying to reach her goal. A thoroughly dysfunctional family is of no help.
B006LZSF8M,Cathy P.,3,i really don't believe that an all veggie diet is the way to go but these people are convinced. Just buy responsible so you know what your getting
B006LZSF8M,JH,5,Real people and real life circumstances made this documentary very easy to watch and understand. It was well constructed and kept me very interested in watching it. I learned a lot too.
B006LZSF8M,Li,5,This film really opens your eyes.  I didn't realize just how badly many animals are treated.  It was interesting but there was a little bit of language.  My family has been vegetarian on and off but now we are going vegan between inhumane practices (even with organic farms!) and other health concerns I think we need this.
B006NU7C48,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,I often as I watch this I never grow tired of it. May be we all need a moment of fabulousness
B006NU7C48,Debby Bright,4,These ladies are priceless!  Their antics remind one of middle school girls with addiction issues .  You could definitely binge watch these episodes...
B006NU7C48,Dominic Freeman,2,I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff
B006NU7C48,gpat65,5,I love this show. So funny! My favorite British comedians. The writers are amazing and this is one of my favorite series
B006NU7C48,kellej,5,I love british humor and this is wonderful!!!!  I have actually watched all of the seasons several times and I never tire of them
B006NU7C48,shootmenow,5,Lotsa fun.  Reminds me of my own selfish flippy-dippy hippie youth.  So refreshing to see ladies who know how to have a good time and are not constantly yammering on about their tedious tots and the tubby hubby.  Martha Stewart would be pitched into the Thames without ceremony.  No white sale at Penney's here.  Highly recommended.
B006O2WRHM,HannahLynn,5,When I first saw this show I was like nope. After watching it a couple more times I saw the good message it sent & my daughter loves to dance & sing a long!
B006O2WRHM,M0ng0l13,5,My two year old freezes in place when we put yo gaba gaba on. Then he mimics DJ Lance's dance moves. Great show!
B006O2WRHM,Venna,5,My Autistic son doesn't have very many favorite shows but this is one of them by far.  He even has tablet games related to the show.
B006O3Z39U,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",5,Will always enjoy GH. Their travels take them places that I would never have considered and the investigation finds along the way make it an enjoyable program.
B006O3Z39U,John E. Scott,5,Just good old ghost hunting at its best . I think ghost hunting should be about gathering evidence of the paranormal. Not so much entertaining the audience but rather explaining the how and why ghost are there and trying to prove it.
B006O3Z39U,LINDA K,4,Steve and Tango still my favorites. They make ghost hunting fun.
B006O3Z39U,R. M "movier",5,I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked.
B006OU14BO,Brenda Santiago,4,but it grasp my attention based on how they chose to live and the so call friends they surround themselves with ...
B006OU14BO,CrimsonKannon,4,The crescendo for these women really takes off once Karen's father is ratted on by Junior and a line starts to be drawn against Carla for her instigating nature.
B006OU14BO,drummer593,5,Well people this is # 2 of a killer Italian girl bad asses show! I love these girls big time! Drama baby! Get it for your collection!
B006OU14BO,Savy Shopper,3,This was pretty good.  I hope that these women were hamming it up for the show because I can't really believe that grown women would act that way.
B006RECSBC,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price.
B006RECSBC,Viva,2,This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake.  It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying.
B006RZZDU4,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,This is a very good animation of iron man and the characters and story line was very good also.  When I watched Iron Man 3 and they mentionextremis and I decided to watch the animation series again and I enjoyed it very much. But it is more for mature audiences than children.
B006RZZDU4,Joseph B. Powell,4,Show has elements from movie and animation is cool as a moving comic.  Great to be able to view on Kindle Fire HD.
B006RZZDU4,Kindle Customer,4,I ordered this movie series because of my little grandson.  He loves the  action but at 3 yrs he doesn't stay long on any one show.  The older grandkids will enjoy the entire series.
B006RZZDU4,wrighthinkingman,5,I actually like watching this animated series with my 4yr old.He likes all the super hero stuff though....but then so do I.
B006S0007E,CW FISHER "stars for connie",4,This is a stop motion comic book and I enjoyed it very much.  Years ago marvel came out with comics books on CD for the computer which I brought and they was very good but I think the public was not ready for the CDs and they did not sell.  I still have these disc but they plays on a very old cumputer system like window 98 and I canot play them anymore but I enjoyed them very much and I am glad they came out with the stop motion comics.  This is a good buy.
B006SV4QFK,Ellyn M. Renken,5,I know people who are &#34;collectors&#34; but what they collect have value.  A person who collects junk definitely needs professional help!  Another thing I cannot understand is how people can live in such filth!  You have to have a mental problem in order to do so.I watch these shows and they reassure me that I'm still all right!
B006SV4QFK,Gizmo "ctwin60",3,After watching these people I feel like I need to take a shower. Where do they find these hoarders they make it seem like there is one in every neighborhood. The show is good but after a couple of episodes it is all the same someone with OCD who has too much stuff and can't part with it. I often wonder if it is even real. One season would have been enough.
B006SV4QFK,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,We watch this almost like watching a train wreck. So many people with some kind of quirky genetic makeup! They could all be related. Always mention some tragic event which triggers the hoarding behavior. Not sure that makes sense when so many people handle tragedies every day. Love how the team manages to scoop out much of the mess and it always gives us incentive to drop off a load at Goodwill!
B006SV4QFK,Jacob Crampton,4,It is amazing to me how some people live their lives. This show shows some pretty extreme cases of hoarding and the steps they take to fix the situation.
B006SV4QFK,julie,4,The minds of some people are very interesting.  It is sad but the reality exists and shedding light on it helps to bring it out if the shadows and into the light where it can be addressed. I thinks it is a fascinating show.
B006SV4QFK,night player,5,Unreal. Have heard of this problem and I think most people have seen garages or basements that have &#34;stuff&#34; that should go but is &#34;needed.&#34; May watch a few more on my kindle fire. Loaded and played with no problems.
B006SV4QFK,Pam S.,5,I'm not at all sure there is anything better than an exclusive tour of other people's filth. THAT is entertainment!
B006SV4QFK,snowdogozzie,5,Very interesting......this show makes me feel good about myself and helps me keep my house clean!
B006SV5Z0U,Christine Poortenga,5,My granddaughter (20 years old) and I watched the whole series in a marathon all nighter. We laughed our heads off. Haven't had that much fun with her and a TV since she liked Disney.
B006SV5Z0U,Mike J. Cianciosi "Mike",1,and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better
B006SV5Z0U,Susan E Crangle,5,I can't stop watching this show - it is so dramatic but in a real way.  It is heartbreaking but often redeeming as well.
B006TA764S,Nick6684,1,Are you kidding me!  That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time.  This was not scary and the concept was very poor...watch this if you want to waste time and money.
B006TA764S,Rodrigo Garay,3,This movie had real potential but lost its way along the way and the reveal was predictable by way of the build up. But it was entertaining most of the time.
B006U3MY7S,barbie "doggy mom",5,Everyone loves Dog! Its a very addicting show and a much watch :) Lots of action and adventure in this reality show!
B006U3MY7S,Cathy Dunican,5,love this show and especially the characters.  I like the great message Dog and Beth always share and it is fun to watch
B006U3MY7S,Constant Reader,3,This show gives an insight into what bounty hunters go through to capture fugitives. Some of the episodes are quite entertaining.
B006U3MY7S,g00se9,2,I just like to listen to the theme song and then i turn it off. if you have seen three episodes you have seen enough.
B006U3MY7S,james,5,Prime ( free episodes ) is  only  on the ones I have seen but at least the sounds works. At least it's a step in the right direction.
B006U3MY7S,shaz,5,I love the end- the way leland smiled at his beaufiful little girl and she smiled back . that is priceless.  And it was one of the better shows :)
B006UAWH2S,Steven Herring,4,A story about virus that takes away your senses seems a little corny perhaps but this film is anything but that. It has great performances from both leads and some great cinematography. I don't think the film had a big budget but you can't tell as they used their money very well to make a great atmospheric film. You can feel the depression in every frame as society tries to cope as they lose their senses one by one. The main love story between Eva Green and Ewen Mcgregor is well done and realistic. It's not the corny type love affair in some films. It feels real and natural and the two have great chemistry on screen. The ending may not please all but I thought it was a brilliant closing scene. I find myself thinking about the film far after I watched it which is quite rare for me. I recommend this to fans of either apocalyptic end of the world or romance dramas as it is equal parts both.
B006UJVOPA,AER,5,The name and photo for the program kept me from watching it. Glad I got past it. Love the plots and twists and turns. Good character development. Beautiful cinematography of the landscapes. Makes me want to go there.
B006UJVOPA,Carol,4,Just wished there were more to watch.  I have always liked Brenda Blethyn.  British detective and mysteries are my favorite .  I saw season 1 on PBS so I had to watch it again.
B006UJVOPA,cg showalter,5,WHAT AN AWESOME SHOW!!! I LOVE British drama series...AND THIS SHOW  IS IT! IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING.
B006UJVOPA,Deanna R Taylor,5,There is always a twist.  Vera is a dogmatic inspector with a very sharp brain.  I anxiously anticipate Season 3.
B006UJVOPA,Diane Sanford,4,I enjoyed these stories and Vera's wry sense of humor.  Please continue with Season two for me to enjoy soon.
B006UJVOPA,Dolores Taylor,5,I Love British detective stories and Vera is very real. Her emotions are all over the place and she does remind me of Colombo. The cast is great and I like all of it.
B006UJVOPA,Evie "book weaver",3,This program is ok but too slow moving for me.  I thought it was a waste of my time watching Vera when I could be watching something else.
B006UJVOPA,Guy Portland Oregon "Guy Portland Oregon",4,now that she has a good group the dci will be able to solve any case that comes along  enjoy
B006UJVOPA,Kathleen M Thomas,4,Really enjoyed this show.  Vera is a believable character.I was hooked after the first episode.  Her partner is also a good character.
B006UJVOPA,L. Grueneberg,5,Love Vera and all her flaws.  She manages to pursue and persist until she is on the right track and solves the mystery with the help of her co-workers.  Stories are not cookie cutter but the theme is original and well written.
B006UJVOPA,LR,4,Vera is doggedly determined to find answers but doesn't know how to manage people.  Maybe that's because she has so many worries of her own that she won't share with anyone.  All of the officers - even the quiet ones - impact the show.  The countryside is beautiful and the evil is truly human evil.  Hope to find more of Brenda Blethyn's shows.
B006UJVOPA,P. Alexander "savyshopper",3,Nothing really wrong with this show it just didn't really keep my attention.  I think I started doing something else before it finished.
B006UJVOPA,Pam Swope "PSwope",4,Only watched one episode but it was good.  Just haven't gotten around to watching more.  &#34;Vera&#34; is a bit of a selfish character but she gets the job done.
B006UJVOPA,R. Jones,4,I enjoyed this series very much. It was a welcome change from the rough and tumble series I just completed (The Commander-it was also very good). The setting and soundtrack was pleasing - I was almost transported! I loved how the lead was a bit of a grumblely-gus and everyone fawned for her approval. A welcome change having a woman in a role where she bucked norms of this genre.
B006UJVOPA,Steve,5,The characters and setting for the show are fabulous. The scenery is beautiful and the intensity of each episode is gripping. Great watch!
B006UJVOPA,Susan,5,I am looking forward to more of the back story of the character Vera.  Well acted and well written. There is a great contrast between the ugly crimes being investigated and beautiful scenery.
B006UJVOPA,T.C.,5,This is a superb who-done-it type show.  The outdoor views are unique and beautiful.  There's just enough curiosity about the main characters to make you care about them.  It's very high quality that you're likely to enjoy.
B006UJVOPA,Wiliam Myers,4,Quite a good show - love the personalities and how they interplay --- just wish there were more seasons and more episodes.
B006V644AO,Crystal Jackson,5,It keeps my three year old daughter's attention.  She loves the action and she actually follows along with their adventures with no problem.
B006V644AO,Kindle MomLKS,5,My 2 year old loves this little group and I love its educational aspect. This is her favorite episode and we wanted to have it on the Kindle anytime.
B006V644AO,suteiquake,5,We bought a few favorite episodes and will probably buy the season when it comes out in full. We often use them traveling and sometimes at home. The show has been great. She has learned ALL her shapes and numbers from it. How many almost 2 year olds know a trapezoid when the see it? Or how to count to 100 by ones AND tens? The only downside is she can have a day when she overstresses about everything (toddler much?) and too many OH NOs from bot and it'll be time to stop it before she cries over nothing.
B006VA3X9I,bruce,5,A nice twist on the pawn star series that seems to be all over television. It is amazing how many different ways these guys do business.
B006VA3X9I,K. R. Merryman,4,Great variety of items pawned. Hard to believe the money people loose because they want money NOW! You can learn a lot about the history of the South in this one.
B006VA3X9I,Mg Gallegos13 "taxed with books",2,I love Pawn Stars and we don't get that particular channel where I just moved so I thought I would watch this as a substitute. It is similar but just didn't have the specialness that goes along with their Las Vegas kin.
B006VA3X9I,Mystery Shopper,4,It's still an entertaining show but some of the events seem as though they're scripted somewhat.  Maybe they are actual things that happened but have been scripted to re-enact what happened.  Still worth watching
B006VA3X9I,TJK,3,I assume it only lasted one season as 2012 appears to be the only season available.....it's OK if not a tad hokey.
B006VEFUJA,E. Yeager,4,A good show about dangerous jobs with over emotional people.
B006VEFUJA,N. Foley,4,Something about this show that just keeps you coming back for more. Perhaps it's the diverse characters or the subject matter but we find it fascinating.
B006VEFUJA,RustyShoemaker,5,I likem all but the swamp ledginShelby is the best glad he got his own show lol ha ha ha
B006VEFUJA,Whale,4,Love Shelby and S&S. Get kind of tired of the logging boys fighting all the time. Seems like they create accidents for the show.
B006VJ7TC6,Chris NYC,5,This show reminds me of a softer version of Burn Notice. Every episode so far has me looking forward to the next and it's a nice change from all the CSI type shows on TV.
B006VJ7TC6,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",5,I LOVE THIS SHOW I WAS HOPING THAT IT WAS NOT CANCEL BUT SINCE I DONT SEE SEASON TWO ON YET IT IS SAD IT WOULD HAVE A MADE A GREAT COMENDY/SERIES SHOW
B006VJ7TC6,White Raven "zxy",5,I loved this show for its quirky characters and original plot lines.  Unfortunately the network did not give it enough time to take off as a series.  I watch it on Hulu where it gets great ratings and good reviews.  Loved it because not every story line involved a murder.  This allowed the writers to do new things and introduce some novel characters.  The same thing happened to another great show I was able to catch on Hulu....Endgame.  Why do we get endless receptions of dorky reality TV dreck and so few well written and fun shows like The Finder?  I curse you Network TV for being so short sighted! I hope the Khardasians all have eight kids each and go live on a shrimp boat at your expense.
B006W59O6I,BlueCrabVintage,4,This is a good show but what ruins it is the scripted dialogue which is unnecessary. Just let the people be themselves and not try to turn them into &#34;actors&#34;.
B006W59O6I,bruce,5,Its interesting to see the problems each trucker has to over come and how they go about getting it done.
B006W59O6I,Chris St Pierre,4,Quite an interesting show. I had previously heard of USHIP but only briefly and never thought about what or who would get into such a business.
B006W59O6I,Citizen John,5,This series demonstrated the risks and hard work of the truckers that bid for their work online.  It was painful to see the sacrifices and trading of one's health in this profession.  The intrinsic rewards of getting the job done were significant though.
B006W59O6I,David Fuller,5,We love this show. just goes to show going with the cheapest bid does not always mean the best shipping
B006W59O6I,Jacob Crampton,4,Its about a group of different people that bid on different items to ship. Watching some of the stuff they ship is interesting and entertaining.
B006W59O6I,Jared Taylor,5,This series was a fun look into competitive shipping and logistics. Each character has his or her own story which allows the viewer to feel absolute vile and contempt for some and root for others. I enjoy watching some of the challenging scenarios that are presented and how each character responds.
B006W59O6I,Lurch,4,I like the way the show works.  A little to much drama sometimes but seeing the things people ship is fun.  Worth a watch just don't take it to much to heart
B006W59XOQ,Adrianne M. Callahan "3kmom",5,This was probably the best season of dance moms out of all of them! The moms were dramatic but not to dramatic and the kids dances were amazing!
B006W59XOQ,Beverly A. Peeples "Gatorlaw",3,Seeing what these amazing kids do is great. Watching the stupid moms 2nd guess the expert they pay to teach their children is boring.  This mindless conversation however is truly overshadowed by the talent and tenacity of the kids.  The kids are sadly victims of their mothers insecurity and pride. Listen to Abby and see your kid do their best.
B006W59XOQ,Hotmess,5,I hate drama in my life.... But I LOVE the drama in at a far! Haha.... I DVR ALL DANCE MOM'S.
B006W59XOQ,Jenny,4,It kills me how parents act when they'er kids do something. they need to sit down and shut up. they pay her to teach them to dance then they complain about her teaching them
B006W59XOQ,Justine,5,I am obsessed with Dance Moms much to my chagrin.  Each episode leaves me conflicted about whether I dislike the moms or Abby more while loving the kids.  Sometimes I understand Abby's frustrations and then pride and then I understand the moms frustrations about the forced competitions between the kids.  I cheer and rage then cheer again.  As I have said I am obsessed with this show.  Cant wait to see how growth changes things.
B006W59XOQ,Ma'am "Ma'am",3,These moms are crazy.  If their kid gets a solo they complain the choreography is bad.  If they don't then Abby is evilThe way Christy attracts the other moms especially the new ones is so seventh grade.O
B006W59XOQ,Mark Hall,5,Love this show... The girls are so amazing to watch in competition.. The moms are a hoot...Abby seems a little harsh and seems to show favoritism but it is her show...
B006W59XOQ,Mona,5,The show keeps my interest.  The infighting is bothersome but watching the children dance is worth it.  I was sort of embarrassed to be watching it with all the language and fighting.  Even those I thought had a bit of class began to join in the frey.  I just keep watching though.
B006WC63X8,James Hall,5,I loved this show! My wife and I were extremely disappointed when it got cancelled. If I had the money I would pay to bring it back!
B006WC63X8,Lynn4399,5,Excellent acting and storyline !!! Wish it would have been renewed. I loved this T.V. show. It kept me on edge.
B006WC63X8,Terrance L. Mcgowan,5,Great series.  Too bad the series had no second season.  What has happened to the supporting cast?  Does Josh Lucas ever shave?
B006X41N2Q,Christpher D. Quye "Cidjack",5,It is great to see a small business turn trash into treasure. It makes me want to go out and fix something!
B006X41N2Q,David A. Bachelder,5,Great show.  I really enjoy seeing Rick and the crew refurbish the odd items that come their way.  They really do a nice job.
B006X41N2Q,Gizmo "ctwin60",5,I love to watch them restore old items. If you like history and working with your hands this is the show to watch. I just hope it doesn't turn into drama surrounding the owner and his employees just leave it about the restorations.
B006X41N2Q,happydigging,5,We really enjoy this show and wish there were more of them on Prime..  Moves fasts and brings back memories of when people were true craftsmen.
B006X41N2Q,HeMeGrrrr,4,Always dig their work. A very interesting way to learn the history of machines & society's urge to preserve it.
B006X41N2Q,Kuhn Rich,4,Rick and crew do amazing work resoring items of the past .I work in the trades and i really appriciate the craftsmanship envolved in these restorations
B006X41N2Q,Lurch,5,Some of the best shows from the restoration program.  Its fun to see items folks have kept for years that need a bit of a touch up or a large make over.  Seeing the beginning and the ending product to me is facanating.  Great for you to see history and what can be done when worked by a master.
B006X41N2Q,Mam,4,It is so fun to watch the items in their completion.  I am constantly amazed though at the amount of money people will spend to get something restored.  Wow!
B006X41N2Q,pam,5,my husband and i really enjoy how this show has progressed and is really a great history show on items.
B006X41N2Q,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,THE BEST!!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!WHEN I HAD CABLE I USED TO GET THIS SERIES....WHEN IT WAS OFFERED BY AMAZON PRIME I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO SEE IT AGAIN!!!!THE BEST IS THERE IS NO COMMERCALS!!!!!
B006X41N2Q,Sandy K "Sandy K",5,Rick always seems to try to make exactly as they were originally.  Good work ethic.  I would encourage baby boomers to see what can be accomplished with forgotten items in attics and sheds.
B006X41N2Q,Thomas G. Reiter,4,I never had watched this show but checked it out on my Kindle.  Pretty neat how these real craftsman restore vintage items and make a good living out of pleasing both the customer and themselves with how their restorations come out.
B006X41N2Q,Trunkneck,5,This man could make a rotten turd look like a million bucks. I'd work with him just to learn some of his tricks.
B006X6JHH2,David Whiting "NYCityfool",5,If you're a fan you need know no more. It was perfect. "Laugh out loud" funny. I want to write more but it would spoil the fun for those who have yet to see this episode.It's a treasure.
B006X6JHH2,Mary Spangler,5,It is worth watching over and over. It makes you laugh out loud and sometimes feel sorry for some of the people in the show... I loved it a lot!
B006X6JHH2,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",5,These latest shows are some of the best yet.  It really seems that Edina has &#34;softened&#34; up to Saffy and Patsy is definitely starting to show her age in more ways than one!
B006Y5AV68,JCruea10,5,I LOVE this show!  I've tried some of the recipes and they came out very nice!  My hubby and kids also love to watch this show.  I love how informative and educational it can be.
B006Y5AV68,Pattye Heuer,4,My husband and I really enjoy this show. The team is so professional and they have great rapport with each other. We would really like to see more seasons from time to time available with our Prime membership. This is just a tease
B006Y5AV68,Philip D,5,Easy to follow recipes. I like how they modernize the classics. I'm even venturing into the world of baking since I've been watching America's Test Kitchen. I'm glad I don't have to wait a week between episodes anymore.
B006Y5AV68,Rebecca Snell "boulder50",5,loved all the episodes and even cooked some of the recipes shown on the videos.  Will cook Turkey and dressing this Holiday season
B006Y5AV68,Wendy Johnson "Imcyked",5,Love this show. They will test a recipe until it is perfect. Then they explain WHY it is prepared a certain way. Their product tests and taste-testing are also helpful.
B006Y5B2XE,BenGray,4,entertaining and surprising twist of actual humanity. I would like to see more seasons of this and see how things go on in the relationship.
B006Y5B2XE,BSM51,5,Seeing Reggie come alive in Clunes has been a true pleasure to watch! The cast is extremely well suited to compliment him in every way.
B006Y5B2XE,I. Behling,3,My husband and I both love Martin Clunes in Doc Martin and in the documentary he did on dogs.  We were very disappointed in Regiie Perrin.  Canned laughter and certainly not a very challenging role for him to play.  Just not the same caliber as Doc Martin. If you have nothing to compare it to Reggie might be quite entertaining.
B006Y5B2XE,Julius Weber,1,Remember Reggie Perrin? Don't be confused this is not the wonderful original but a poor and very unconvincing remake. Its terrible.
B006Y5B2XE,Tenderfoot,3,This show would kill if it didn't have a laugh track. If it were made today it probably would not have it. British humor rocks.
B006Y5B2XE,Tom,4,If you liked Doc Martin you will probably like this thought the characters are not so numerous or so quirky endearing. It is a robust commentary on life in the corporate world (at least somewhere). The quick asides are marvelous as are the fantasy quick episodes. The episodes get better as you go on.
B006Y5BWQG,Carlos B. Mangrobang "Capricorn Foto",4,Katharine McPhee could've won American Idol but she was destined to do something else in life.  She is an actress with a golden voice.  This talent opens opportunities that not everyone can handle.  A show like smash was definitely written around her and she deserves it.I can't wait for season two.  There is enough drama in the last season that kept me watching.  My family loves it and I surely enjoy watching the show.
B006Y5BWQG,Christine A. Rushbrook,5,This is a wonderful show about the ins and outs of on stage productions. The cast of actors is unparalled
B006Y5BWQG,Elizabeth Good,5,I marathoned episodes every night for four days staying up to two in the morning and being exhausted the next day at work because I had to see it. And bought the second season immediately aftet! The music performances were so good. I really enjoyed the actors. So sad to hear it might be canceled.
B006Y5BWQG,Jerry D. Mills,2,I've rated this once  Nice voices but not a lot of change in plots  Love the voices and the new
B006Y5BWQG,MikeyrInKY "Mike",5,Smash is just that. Best thing I've ever seen Debra Messing do. Cast is amazing! I really do love it...
B006Y5BWQG,Sherrie H,5,I had heard a lot about Smash and saw the first show of the season on TV. There were so many characters that I was turned off immediately because when there are so many characters it is difficult to keep up and remember who is who.  For some reason I didn't let that stop me when the DVD of the First Season came out--WOWEEEE!!! I can see now why this show got all kinds of good press. I just finished watching the whole season from this morning until tonight.  The story reminds me of the movies long ago about broadway and theatre and rising stars. Katherine McFee has a huge part (remember her in Idol) and she is fantastic. Angelica Houston and Debra Messing are also featured prominently and Jack Davenport (if you never saw COUPLES-GET IT NOW!) and a few other people you will recognize from other shows. The story is a story in  a story regarding developing a musical about Marilyn Monroe (if you don't know who she is you must live under a rock!) and the back biting and all that goes with the making of any broadway show-everyone wants to be the star and it's a fight to the finish. The music is absolutely glorious and I intend to buy the sound track asap. This like some of my other reviews is a joy to watch and again with no special effects and music and dancing throughout the show. The main characters - well they are all main characters and they play them perfectly and once I got into it I had no problem figuring out who was who. I can't wait until Tuesday when the second season starts;... believe me--if you don't see this show you will be missing what I almost missed and this is another series I intend to watch over and over and over! They may be some folks who don't know about Marilyn Monroe and I would suggest they seek out some of her movies so they can see why even more than 50 years have gone by and  she is still a box office hit!!  In one word: FANTABULOUS!!!!
B006Y5BWQG,toni gulotta,5,loved the show.  music was great  sorry there is not more of the series.  looking for another show that is similar.
B006Y5BWQG,Z. J. Garcia "snozwanger",4,Fun to watch. There is a lot of dancing and singing. A musical in series format. The grown up Glee.
B006Y5C5XA,Devan Shane,5,I'm not someone who would usually watch a musical at all.. But this show has me hooked. I'm hoping for many season too come.
B006Y5C5XA,Ponytail Pam,5,Love watching it on my Kindle. Hope it isn't cancelled anytime soon. I have a problem with that . . . . . get attached to a good show and - voila - it's gone!
B006Y5C5XA,SoCal Mom,5,good tv.. but better as DVD... a change from usual weekly TV action and shoot 'em ups.. more complex story and characters.. setting was great fun... music also a welcome change.. season two also a good bet for watching...
B006Y5D5QG,Bill C,5,Fitz is a complicated character.  His personal problems are interwoven with the crimes he dissolving in a very realistic way.  This is an unusual series - a little out of the ordinary - which makes it quite intriguing.
B006Y5D5QG,S. Marsh,4,The first shows had too much sound going on and no closed captioning. It was hard to follow. Later they stopped playing music and conversation in the background besides what they were saying. It got easier to understand. Didn't have a rapport yet with the actors.
B006Y5DODA,Carol,5,I adored this show....what a story of getting through one's life and in the end regretting nothing and still believing in love!
B006Y5DODA,Quiltnb "QuiltnB",5,How could you not enjoy a great mystery with the main character a mother of four children.  Really good storyline on both her personal and professional levels.  Does not disappoint.
B006Y5GHU2,BenGray,4,interesting and made me want to come back for another season. I do recommend for mystery lovers to watch. Interesting.
B006Y5GHU2,frank a chambers,5,Another British Police show that is outstanding entertainment and very believeable.  I wish there was another season or two to watch.
B006Y5GHU2,Quiltnb "QuiltnB",5,Love British movies and this does not disappoint.  Caroline Quentin really brings her character to life in a real way.  Great show.
B006Y5GHU2,Roberta,5,caroline Quentin is so normal.  she plays a single working mom with a brain who is able to handle her job and her children.  I love her.
B006Y5GHU2,S. Lee "waterwoman39",4,We enjoyed to the end. Watching one episode a day keeps the story flow in mind better than waiting a week .  These are likable characters and the the pacing is good.
B006YP42IG,Bob,4,Interesting take on a few well known supernatural creatures.  Like the actors a lot.  Can't wait to watch the next season.
B006YP42IG,Craig Louis Webber,5,This is a great series with fun and entertaing twists and turns. The humor is so bad that it's good. A good investment of time.
B006YP42IG,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,picks right up from last season and if you liked Season 1 you will like Season 2 (so far at least)
B006YP42IG,DVDwatcher,5,I really enjoyed season 1 so I couldn't wait for season 2. I'm glad to see that it has continued to season 3 and I am looking forward to when that comes out.  I could do without the music/songs playing (geared towards the 18-25 group) and they do get a little graphic sometimes. But overall I enjoy the characters and the stories.  Looking forward to the next season.
B006YP42IG,Jeff Riley,4,Season one repeated the English episodes but in season 2 they make the story their own. It really takes the characters into a different direction and they make the show their own.
B006YP42IG,Megan,5,i loved it just wish the show was still on! i think it  comes back in january but all around awesome show
B006YP42IG,melvin watkins,5,this show continues to peek my entrest so many highs and lows it's enough to make want talk back to freak'n television so that's why i continue to watch it
B006YP42IG,Morgan Harris,5,One of the greats modern sci fi dramas ever.  It makes you reexamine your own humanity and what it means to be &#34;alive&#34;.
B006YP42IG,Richard Pokallus,5,I like this series so I have been buying them as they come out for sale. It is a great series.
B006YP42IG,Seb311,5,I liked the British version but this is actually a really good version too. Highly recommend. Plus its free on prime.
B006YP42IG,SR "SR",5,The video quality is excellent (HD). You just have to make sure that you have a good connection. I love the show. I have been hooked ever since it came out. It is my True Blood (but totally different) when True Blood is on its year long hiatus. Great Show!
B006YP42IG,Troy D,5,This show really keeps you wanting more. The graphics are great and the show keeps you thinking. Great writers!Can't wait for the next seasons surprises.
B006YZSC3C,aloha1127,4,Its a good show that is entertaining.I think the writing is missing a few key scenarios and plot twists in each episode.
B006YZSC3C,Camilla Stradley,5,Wow!  This one keeps adding more and more twists to it.  It is suspense and CSI all together.  Love it.
B006YZSC3C,Cheryl Carter "cartec",5,I really enjoyed the series.  It ended on cliffhanger which led me to believe it would return for a second season .  I went online to search for more information and found none.  I will be very disappointed if it does not return.  Sam Neil is outstanding in their suffering role of man with too many responsibilities on his mind.  The plot is very versatile and always refreshing.  Ideally hope it returns.
B006YZSC3C,Diane Bevans,4,show was short lived so no answers were really given as to the disappearance and reappearance of the inmates and others there.
B006YZSC3C,Grover D Carson,5,I truly liked the series but it appears that there was never an ending and the series just ended. In other words the series just left me hanging looking for more and I never got it.
B006YZSC3C,J. C. Wiltshire,5,This was a great show. Had awesome &#34;lost&#34; type potential with the built-in plots of each of the missing inmates. Sad they cancelled it as we were looking forward to this season.
B006YZSC3C,Jo-Rell "The Word",5,I wished the show was never cancelled .. So they could have finished the show but overall it was good. Story was very interesting made you think a lot .. At times it was a bit slow but it felt as they was holding back on the story to add into season 2 but the ending was really bad since it left me wanting more .. But overall the show was good
B006YZSC3C,Patrick R Smith,4,Enjoyed this series a lot and would watch again. Thank you for bring us content like this in Amazon. I Enjoy the plot of this series.
B006YZSC3C,Richard Schaefer,4,This series had so much promise. It was obviously planned for more than one season with the premise of tracking down some 63 inmates one at a time who disappeared from The Rock back in the 1960's. Unfortunately it lasted only one season. Each prisoner had his own &#34;story&#34; and there was an ongoing sub-plot involving the 1960's warden and some dark medical experiments being conducted in the prison. We will never know the outcome since the series disappeared just as the prisoners had. Perhaps it will reappear in 50 years. One can always hope.
B006YZSC3C,Savy Shopper,4,It was a very interesting series.  My only complaint was that its over.  I guess it did not get renewed.
B006YZSC3C,S. S. "Super",4,A bit of history and a lot of underlying plots with a side of old guyscovering up their crazy mistakes.  Way out there but very watchable
B006Z48TZS,Alfonzo "charter duck",5,This is such a compelling series with fine acting and superior story lines that we just can't stop watching the next one!
B006Z48TZS,Alicia Yates,5,Wish I knew what I had been missing by not watching this show! I absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW!! You will have your favorite lines & characters you will be hooked!
B006Z48TZS,Amazon Customer "chemming",4,Protecting their land in the Ky mountains where the coal is along with basic human interaction among people with few possessions and conflicts with the law and big business.
B006Z48TZS,Amazon Customer,4,It's a show about a cop who takes no crap from the bad guys. Good acting makes this a 4-star choice.
B006Z48TZS,Amazon Customer,5,This is a  wonderful show its actors are talented and beliveable...I get involved with the story line and the hour pasts with great hase...keep them coming...
B006Z48TZS,Amazon Customer,5,We love Justified - we are addicted!  It is so worth it to watch without the commercials - even fast forwarding through them - what a pain - this is the best way to watch this series.
B006Z48TZS,Annie,5,Love this show about to start season 4 hope it's as good as the previous 3 Timothy Olyphant is worth the watch!!!
B006Z48TZS,Annie Wilson,5,Consistently good story line. Timothy Olyphant is great as is the supporting cast. Have watched seasons 1-3 so far and would recommend.
B006Z48TZS,Anon "Anon",4,I was a little disappointed in this season... The plot line was weak and never really found its groove. But still enjoyable to watch
B006Z48TZS,artist in residence "artist in residence",5,I enjoy a shows that proves bullies for what they are and then rights those wrongs.  I'm not all that crazy about the violence but it goes along with the story line and that doesn't bother me so much.I really like Timothy Olyphant as an actor too.  I get what he's thinking and while he is telling the story.I wish this series would continue.
B006Z48TZS,Ashley Thomas,5,Entertaining at every turn! Can't stop watching all the episodes. Every season just keeps getting better. Highly recommend Justified to anyone.
B006Z48TZS,awilderirishrose,5,What's not to love about this show?  The characters are sooo interesting; never tire of them and the plots are riveting.
B006Z48TZS,azloree,5,Highly entertaining TV show - can't wait to see Season 4.  One of the best written and acted series that I have seen.
B006Z48TZS,aztnge,4,Good actors & acting ~ lots of shooting & killing which I like ~ makes it more realistic ~ wish it had more sex
B006Z48TZS,Baroque Music Lover,5,Walton Goggins is a wonder to behold.  The sad fact that the Big Networks have abandoned Scripted Dramas like this for &#34;Reality&#34; shows how really out of touch they are with good television is all about.  Jeremy Davies is a reassure!
B006Z48TZS,Becky M. Brooks,5,Plenty of snark mixed with loads of action along with a storyline threaded throughout the entire series makes this a must-see.
B006Z48TZS,Beverly Johnson,5,I wasn't sure where Season 3 would go after the &#34;Mags Bennett&#34; story line but I am pleased with the new developments and new situations. Very enjoyable.
B006Z48TZS,Camilla Stradley,5,I got introduced to this show when a freind bought me season 1.  Now both my husband and I are hooked!
B006Z48TZS,C. A. Neal,5,I watched Season 3 a few weekends ago in a marathon session. I stayed up all night to watch the entire season. It held my attention and made me want to watch more! I love this season of Justified!
B006Z48TZS,Cathy Hale,5,I chose this rating because I absolutely live this awesome show I hope thst the next season comes out soon.
B006Z48TZS,ccc,5,Great show  enjoy the interaction with all the characters up with the times. Funny and witty for all and yet serious also.
B006Z48TZS,Craig Miller,5,Great series.  Well worth the time. My wife has also become a fan of the show. I would recommend it to anyone asking.
B006Z48TZS,Dave PA,5,A great season that opens up some new chapters and closes up a few others. If you are a few you do not want to miss it!!
B006Z48TZS,ddddd,4,Enjoyed this series from the start. Good acting. Good characters. Good plot. It sure would be nice to have Season 4 on prime.
B006Z48TZS,Deborah Branson "DB",5,I am totally hooked on Justified.  Timothy Olyphant is one of the sexiest men on television.  The backwoods drama is very entertaining.  I can hardly wait for next season!
B006Z48TZS,Debra D. Thiele,5,I love the show and its main characters.  It is an adult themed drama and not a family show.  So I would advise not allowing young teens to view it.
B006Z48TZS,debra marrero,5,I enjoy this show I watched it on tv when it was at 9pm now it is at 10pm ugh
B006Z48TZS,Dennis "barbarosa",5,I have enjoyed every episode of all three years of this show and am happy to own all three seasons. Each episode is extremely well made and continues Mr. Olyphant's Lou Gehrig like record of appearing in only excellent movies and television shows. I have yet to see anything that Mr. Olyphant has appeared in that wasnt superb from "Hitman" to "Crazies" to the Justified Television Series.Of course this years episodes as well as the two preceeding it come with my highest recommendations. View everyone if there is any way for you to do so.
B006Z48TZS,diannerae,5,I didn't know sony made such good series. Wish season 4 would be released soon.It really is addictive to watch.
B006Z48TZS,D. Robertson,5,This is one of the best of the shows currently running on TV.  It is the number one &#34;must watch&#34; shows on my schedule right now.  I like the mixture of humor and action each week
B006Z48TZS,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",5,Hope the next season comes to Prime. I enjoyed the quick draw marshal and the complex story line. Oliphant is great.
B006Z48TZS,Edna M. Dooley "Doolster",5,This is a wonderful show with all the actors giving their all I think. Great show. Waiting for next season!!!
B006Z48TZS,Elizabeth Cavalone,5,This isn't your typical cowboy shoot em up show. Yes there are violent scenes but  the dialogue is well written and even Rayland's nemesis Boyd has redeeming qualities.
B006Z48TZS,Encino,5,Justified rebounded in this 3rd season after a disappointing 2nd season. Hats off to the writers for ending the Raylon/Winona relationship and introducing a group of new villains. This is a well-written and well-acted series. Top notch entertainment. Thank you FX and Amazon.
B006Z48TZS,Ernie Fordham,5,Season 3 followed the first two with more quality programming and plot twists. Always enjoyable to watch. Now watching season 4 and waiting on season 5.
B006Z48TZS,Gerold Ransom "G Mon'e",4,Nice show can't wait to see the end I wonder what is going to happen in this series of events
B006Z48TZS,G. Neal "EMPEROR",4,A great show that keeps getting better.  Wonderful characters.  Dynamic plot.  Excellent pacing.  It's a must see!  You'd be hard pressed to find a better quality show.
B006Z48TZS,grandma,4,It is so addicting.  Can not stop watching.  We will watch 2 or 3 episodes in one night.  Thank you Prime.
B006Z48TZS,greenapple,5,Really enjoyed watching this show.  It was nice to have the opportunity to watch on Amazon prime after missing the last season when it aired on regular tv.
B006Z48TZS,greg,5,one of the best series i have seen in years. im writing this because i have to. watch from the begining
B006Z48TZS,Greg V,5,I'm really hooked on this series.  Interesting how actors that also worked in Deadwood seem to keep showing up.  The only way it could be better for me is to have more episodes per season.
B006Z48TZS,helena,5,Im Very happy with my purchase. I am very glad that Amazon has the movie/dvd products to buy or rent.
B006Z48TZS,Inky,5,This is a really great show. I can't wait to watch more. There's isn't anything else like it on TV.
B006Z48TZS,Isaac N Hoagland,5,The writing continued being well done.  Same with the acting.  The chemistry between actors was a little better in this season as well.
B006Z48TZS,Jack,5,Can't miss a minute!! Great drama good humor. Raylene US Marshall Bad Ass with a gentle side for bad friends.
B006Z48TZS,James A. Moore "Jim",5,This is one of those shows where we get hooked and just HAVE to keep up with this true-to-life gunslinging hero.
B006Z48TZS,James D. Tate "tate manor",5,Each episode draws me deeper into the series.  Every character is well developed; so either like or hate them.  My only regret with Justified is there are only 13 episodes each season; 20 or so would be much better.  The other cable series have 20+ episodes; a hit like Justified should too.
B006Z48TZS,James R. Turner,5,Good writing good characters and photography eyes plotline just a really good good show to watch  wish they were more shows like this
B006Z48TZS,Jeepin' rocks!,5,I absolutely love this series. I was hooked the first time I watched it. Its' so hard waiting for the next season to come out. I ususually just watch the past seasons over. Timothy Olephant and all the actors are terrific in this show. Highly recommend.
B006Z48TZS,Jeff Riley,5,I love all the these characters. They are so much fun. Each storyline is original and fun. I look forward to the next season.
B006Z48TZS,Joanne,5,Justified has a great cast and wonderful writers.  The guest stars are perfect and what's not to like about the Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder dynamic!
B006Z48TZS,Julia A. Antoon "shamoonya",5,Almost done with season three and still entralled in this well written series.  All of the actors are excellent and so believable.Can't stop watching it.
B006Z48TZS,Kathy,4,Love the characters especially Boyde.  I love snide comments and the throw away lines are just too funny.  I really enjoy this show.
B006Z48TZS,K.V.,5,This is the best show on TV. It just keeps getting better and better. The cast is awesome and the storyline is so cool.
B006Z48TZS,LacrosseD "LacrosseD",5,Enjoyed this season of an excellent series.  If you are interested in watching I strongly suggest starting at season one episode one.
B006Z48TZS,lily,5,This show is consistently excellent.  The show is so good that there is a temptation to just run through the episodes non stop. Justified is a gem - what TV can be.
B006Z48TZS,linda21,5,It's so good my husband bought the 4th season being we never watched on TV it's great in January the 5th season will air then I will watch on TV. You can not be disappointed with this TV show
B006Z48TZS,Liz Hart,5,completely hooked on this show. Can't stop watching it. been on a binge for days. Gives you an idea of what goes on in the South.
B006Z48TZS,lynne,5,I just love justifed.  I am on season 4. I dont know what I am going to do when it is finished
B006Z48TZS,Lynne M Core,5,enjoy it all the way the characters remain episode one after another. Wish I wasn't charged for every one would rather pay a one time fee.
B006Z48TZS,Mam,5,From Season one we have been enjoying this show.  This is not like any show on TV thank goodness somebody in TV land still has imagination.  LOVE IT!
B006Z48TZS,Marianna Conner,5,I started  watching this show and now I am hooked. It's right up there with Breaking Bad. It has just enough redneck humor in it to make the characters believable. Great casting.
B006Z48TZS,Marrette Chambers "mchambers",4,This was good.  It got a little stale in the middle then picked up at the end of the season.  I was glad I watched all the way to thru. This is some heart stopping entertainment.  It is not for the squeamish.
B006Z48TZS,MaryBee,5,Really enjoy the characters on Justified. The writing in this show is excellent. We've been watching past seasons throughout our summer...good stuff!
B006Z48TZS,Mary M Riley,5,The casting is great. The writing is great. The characters are great. The acting is great. Their voices are all great. Exceptional TV. Exceptional work.
B006Z48TZS,M. Blackledge "Everyday user",5,Is a great show and I would highly recommend it to the 'cowboy' or girl in the family.  It mixes the right amount of fun and comedy with serious content.  It has an outlaw element that might not be suited for the younger members.
B006Z48TZS,MikeyrInKY "Mike",5,This show benefits from great writing and terrific acting performances. The plot twists just never end and the action is non-stop. Then there are the villains. The show continues to come up with bad guys( and ladies) who are engaging while evil. I strongly recommend this show to all but children as the content is definitely for a mature audience only.
B006Z48TZS,mlstillman,5,I am super stoked that amazon prime has Justified and other Fx shows that Netflix doesn't have.  Not just season 3 but all the seasons of Justified. Thank you
B006Z48TZS,Money_Maker,4,So far this has been a good series something to keep you entertained I look forward to the next series
B006Z48TZS,mparrish,5,Great show.Would like to see more episodes.I highly recommend  watching.You will not be able to stop watching.
B006Z48TZS,Music is good for you,5,Producers and writers keep having a great time killing people and making Raylan a modern-day Gary Cooper sheriff who enjoys using his gun.  Perfect bad guys and plenty of temptations for all of the good people.
B006Z48TZS,M. Weber,5,Justified does it again; my wife and I have been binge watching Justified and enjoyed Season 3 more than any other; the new villain Mr. Quarles and Limehouse were good additions to the staff
B006Z48TZS,Myrna I McKnight,5,We need more of this type of marshalls in real life. Too bad our society has made our law enforcement officers such targets and tied their hands.
B006Z48TZS,Nan,5,Waiting for Season 4 to be on Prime. Love this series. Great Series. Wish there were more like it. for sure
B006Z48TZS,O. Mallard,5,This is an excellent series. i have watched all the series up to the current one now. I love watching tv shows and movies on Amazon Prime - love watching what I want when I want. If you are interested in an action packed series with something exciting going on in every expisode you need to watch these previous series and catch up to the current season
B006Z48TZS,O. Vaughn "Movie Fan",5,We started watching Justified with the first season and were hooked.  I love all the depth of the characters and the acting is superb! A modern day Western to be sure!
B006Z48TZS,Phyllis DeSio,5,This season three of Justified was very thrilling every episode was very exciting than previous one - just love watching
B006Z48TZS,P. K. Nolen,5,Watching with baited breath as they say. I love this guy. He is so laid back and the action is great.
B006Z48TZS,R. A. Macgaren,5,I love Timohy Olyphant and love him in this show.  This show just moves at all times and each season is so very interesting.  I will watch these over again.
B006Z48TZS,REGRETFUL,5,Neither the acting or story lines have lost a step. Highly entertaining and very engrossing. I would highly recommend watching this series.
B006Z48TZS,Richard C. Anderson,5,Deputy Marshall Raylan Givens is a totally entertaining character.  Elmore Leonard at his very best.  And the complex relationships are wonderful to watch
B006Z48TZS,R. L. Hearn,5,I used to love to watch Marshall Matt Dillon get the bad guys and Marshall Raylan gets the bad guys too though he has to deal with a lot of complex issues to do it. All the actors make their parts so believable and poor Raylan never runs out of bad guys to deal with.
B006Z48TZS,Robert A. Giunta "HalfWalker",5,Plot and acting get better as the seasons move forward. Bad guys get badder and you can fell the weight of the job wearing on Rayland as he finds and shoots more fugitives.
B006Z48TZS,Robert Fischer "Alone At the Alter",5,I loved this series and so did my wife. I love purchasing and watching using my Roku. Amazon allows me to keep my movies and music in the cloud at no cost. Easy access from any mobile device.
B006Z48TZS,Roger E. Ervast,5,I never gave it much consideration when it was first released.  Once I started watching it I was amazed at how much I loved the stars and characters in it.
B006Z48TZS,Roger L. Boese "FirstConsultant",4,A few inconsistent plots but overall good escapist entertainment.  No surprises and some characters appear only to evaporate for the rest of the season.  One cannot be sure there will be a season 3 but the are a number of open threads that can be taken further.
B006Z48TZS,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",5,Much like the action of the first and second season. Some parts are unbelievable but entertaining. The acting is mostly superb. I am starting the 4th season with great anticipation.
B006Z48TZS,Seb311,5,This is one of the most underrated shows on TV. I have converted quite a few people to this show who now all love it. I did the same thing with Breaking Bad before it blew up and became a culture phenomenon. Hopefully this show will gain more followers who discover it.  While this isn't on the level of breaking bad it is still a very good show.
B006Z48TZS,Shadhawk,5,the humor keeps me laughing and gives a feel of deadwood us marshal style. Olyphant and Gogginsplay well off each other.
B006Z48TZS,Shad,5,It is not cowboys and Indians it is a country cops and robbers. This is not a game checkers it is Chess. Keeps everything interesting.
B006Z48TZS,shane molitor,5,Another greatFX series. Can't get enoough of it and having it saved in the cloud is my new way to buy. No more kids losing or destroying my discs :). If this series appeals to u then u should check out The Shield and Sons of Anarchy as well.
B006Z48TZS,Sherry A. Mccall,4,really liked this season better than two and better than four. that said number three was very much the best so far.
B006Z48TZS,snowdogozzie,5,we watch at least one episode every night after supper! Always exciting and fun to watch! What are those crazy Kentuckians going to do next!
B006Z48TZS,srrogers50,5,This is a great series. I am so glad I found it. It is now one of my favorite television shows.
B006Z48TZS,Steamer,4,Enjoy seeing life in flyover country. All the acting is great. Love Boyd. Keep these type of shows coming to Prime.
B006Z48TZS,Sudsy,5,A wonderful series. Great acting and the plot lines are very interesting.Love to &#34;hate&#34; some of the leading  characters.
B006Z48TZS,Sunni,5,Every actor in Justified is excellent. It is amazing to find a series with superb acting even those with bit parts. I am on Season four and when I finish Season five it will be difficult to find a replacement. Timothy is outstanding and I now have a new favorite male actor.
B006Z48TZS,TAMUNOSIKI MINA,5,Unending action and he has a county full of great people and ideas of some bad concoction to make money the wrong way
B006Z48TZS,thepoetnmotion,4,The series is well acted and moves at a good pace. It holds your interest. Olyphant is given some good one liners.
B006Z48TZS,Timothy J Kilkka,3,Left me wanting to see the next episode just to see what would happen. It was a great show and the actors seemed to have it together.
B006Z48TZS,TJC,5,This show does not suffer from decline as most tv shows do. This one just keeps getting better and coming up with fresh ideas.  I hope this show keeps going for some time.
B006Z48TZS,T. J. Foster,5,I love this show and think its worth the invested time. I've been binge watching it even though Netflix is throttling my account. It's worth the blurry screen to watch this show.
B006Z48TZS,TKD Fan,2,The story line is getting more interesting BUT way too much unnecessary gore!  Not sue why they feel the need to directly show all that.
B006Z48TZS,T. L. Smith,5,I am really enjoying this series. I don't like the language as they take the Lord's name in vain frequently. The storyline is very good. I would recommend it if you can overlook the foul language.
B006Z48TZS,Tori "Effortless",5,I love this show. Like most Elmore Leanord stories the dialogue is brilliant and has a cadence all it's own. The acting in this is top notch. I've watched this show from the first episode and so far have loved every single one.
B006Z48TZS,Travis Anderson,5,Now I am going to have to watch this series cuz I'm hooked and I have to see what is going to happen to all the characters.
B006Z48TZS,Webster68,5,Outstanding show to watch.  I Look forward to very episode.  May not reflect the true actions of the U.S. Marshals service but it is just a show after all.
B006Z48TZS,William E. Rice,5,Very tight from start to finish. I like the transition in how he works people in different situations
B006Z48TZS,yongbing1,5,Westerns will never die. This is a real western set in the eastern part of the U.S.A. The Timothy Oliphant is flawless. The show is priceless entertainment. I love it. Hope it goes on forever. Elmore Leonard's short story has achieved classic TV proportions.
B006Z8461A,A. J. B,4,it was a typical movie revealing prejudices along the way. an inspiring story for those struggling with an addiction. he finally overcame the odds to be what he wanted to be.
B006Z8461A,Kevin burns "kevin Burns",2,i thought this was going to be way better but it was a fat guy eating then just loosening the weight but people still hated him because of ruinning a wedding so it was not worth watching
B006Z8461A,Sandra E. Chatelain,5,Engrossing&#8230;.no pun intended.  Best film I have seen about compulsive overeating.  It is an inspiring docudrama.  I'm from metro NY and love the characters.  So familiar.
B0070TEN7A,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,3,The commander does such unwise actions relative to men that it distracts from the police work. Initially I thought that she was all business at work and above any personal relationships with suspects and colleagues. Her lack of good judgment makes the series annoying. I could not suspend my disbelief and annoyance.
B0070TEN7A,fchmdpc,5,We loved watching this. It was edgy and  captivating. We highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Britmysteries.
B0070TEN7A,P. Bates,4,I had never heard of this series before but usually like the British mystery shows. I enjoyed season 1 and have also watched season 2. Will be continuing with the next ones.
B0070TEN7A,Thomas W. Flacke,3,Well done but I do not look forward to endless internal drama struggles but no conclusion to the crime. I don't know if that is going to happen but will know when we finish the second program.
B0070XUDOS,B.C. "Defend Liberty",3,Technical shortcomings of picture quality consistent with the production period will distract some viewers immediately.  But for those looking beyond this will find the Chesterton stories interesting.  I would make an analogy to early Twilight Zone episodes - sit any kid down and the first reaction will be about black and white and then about cinematography so &#34;alien&#34; (pardon the pun) to today's experience.  My bottom line:  give one or two episodes a try before you turn your back on this series.
B0070XUDOS,Erica,5,it is a great film version of the famous father Brown books that have been so popular for so long!
B0070XUDOS,Stacy Joura,4,Kenneth More is well cast in the series.  The screenplays are true to the original Father Brown short stories byG K Chesterton.  Most of the stories are found in The Innocence of Father Brown.
B0070XUDOS,Whomike "Whomike",5,By today's standard violent/graphic TV fare- This series is a little bit restrained. That is exactly why I like it! You can watch and have a nice pleasant feeling at the end when Father Brown solves the mysteries. You do not feel upset by violent criminals and &#34;everybody's an FBI agent&#34; or &#34;sleazy lawyer&#34; type of TV.This is great entertainment!! Set in England around1974-75 the stories invole quaint small English villiages and their interesting inhabitants. I recommend highly!
B0071E6J30,Brandonia,4,Maybe or maybe not there is a book of secrets but it's really cool to watch and to think about after the fact.
B0071E6J30,Craig Louis Webber,5,Extremely informative and captivating. You get a &#34;glimpse&#34; of what goes on behind the scenes in our government. True or not - I'll leave that up to you?
B0071E6J30,cynthia,2,This show is informative but extremely boring. It seemed to drag.  We did not make it through the first showing.
B0071E6J30,Flannel Quilter,3,This series was about American icons and important places. I can't figure out why I would care about the Playboy Mansion and Fort Knox in the same series. Did Hugh Hefner pay for the series so he could get some publicity?  Skip the playboy episode.
B0071E6J30,Jack Summer,4,I found this episode to be enjoyable and interesting which was showing the inside secrets of the white house. Good show.
B0071E6J30,Karen L. Ball,3,Fell asleep watching it. It was rather boring. Don't remember what it was about because it was so boring. Sorry.
B0071E6J30,Kim,4,If you saw National Treasure you will like watching these episodes.  I like to watch educational shows sometimes and this was pretty interesting.
B0071E6J30,Kitty,3,I've only watched a few of the episodes and they are interesting and worth watching to know something about them.
B0071E6J30,Mary,4,I have not finished watching this series but so far it's really quite interesting.  See secrets of the White House and other things not taught in school.
B0071E6J30,M. KochKetola "Otaku",1,The moment you bring in a far right rabid dog and demagogue/fear monger like Alex Jones in as a contributor you destroy all you credibility you once had.
B0071E6J30,Nurse Sandie,4,Enjoying this series of programs.  Keep an open mind when watching it.  Some of it will make you really think.
B0071E6J30,rmkjbg6,5,Excellent show.  Very informative and interesting.  Ready to watch more episodes to learn more about America's Book of Secrets soon
B0071E6J30,Savy Shopper,4,Many movies have been made regarding some of these &#34;Secrets&#34;.  Having been raised in the DC area it was interesting to me that a lot are based in facts.
B0071E6J30,stoneyb,5,excellent show. I like secrets and this show had many of then.  I will watch this again and again. thanks
B0071E6J30,TomG "CW Junkie",4,Lots of details that I have never heard before. Good entertainment when there's little on cable TV worth watching if you over 65.
B0071IDK88,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,4,I have a son and would definitely protect him from harm. I thought the story interesting given multiple perspectives - enemies.
B0071IDK88,John T. foster,5,Makes you think about all the 'little' battles during the war that never made the news till the end.Some familiar faces also.
B0071IDK88,V R. Clark,3,This series was entertaining to a point.  The altruistic theme was a little too thick and tended to slow the real plot.  The altruistic line always bogs-down the story and seems to always take up so much of the air time the viewer gets bored and wants to leave the show!  Other than that it was worth the time spent to watch!  The theme and plot were well written and acted out.  The amateur-spy aspect played just right as to enhance the historical setting and events.  Conflict was abundant and helped overcome the altruistic bog.
B0071MUKEG,A. M. Bonito,4,I think this series is very worth watching. All of the actors and actresses do a great job. I would recommend this to others.
B0071MUKEG,Bonnie Chinnick,4,A bit slow starting but grew into an interesting story.  Interesting to experience the class structure in a different society.
B0071MUKEG,Carolyn,4,I like shows set in that era. It gives you a look at how some people might have lived then. I like the costumes. I like how they show people from different &#34;classes&#34; live and or work in the same place.
B0071MUKEG,Ellyn M. Renken,5,I've watched this series twice now and enjoyd it greatly each time.  It takes you back to the early 1900's when such things as indoor plumbing and electricity were new.  It takes you back to the days when who your parents were dictated what success you would have in life.  You will find yourself laughing (and crying) with the characters involved.An excellent seledtion for entertainment and a look at early post-World War I England.
B0071MUKEG,Nika "LovesDharma",5,This show is highly addictive. You get involved in the rich story lines and you will fall in love with the cast.
B0071MUKEG,Pat Babcock,5,A great British show made in the 90s. Stephen Moyer (Vampire Bill in True Blood) plays one of the characters in the first season. The show has some great story lines and I was so surprised that Russell T Davies wrote most of the episodes since he's better known for Dr Who and Torchwood.
B0071UYJFE,A. T. Williams,5,In 2012 we should have expected this kind of story. . . one that shows us that we are connected in so many odd and wonderful ways. Sutherland is definitely not reprising his persona on 24. He shows much more vulnerability to the issues of his unusual son who doesn't speak. Both father and son Jake find ways to communicate while solving connection glitches between seemingly unrelated people. It looks like we're in for another season since Touch was renewed. This is a fresh approach that makes for great TV.
B0071UYJFE,Chris's Review,5,I watched all episodes of touch. Couldn't wait until the next week got here so I could see another episode. Each week the plot got better and Kiefers son was in more and more danger. I suggest you watch Touch from beginning to end.
B0071UYJFE,Patricia Doherty,5,The ACTING is very good and the characters unusual and interesting. The PLOTS and characters are interwoven in intriguing ways. Connections are made through mystic numbers supplied by an autistic child. Fresh and well done series that I highly recommend.
B0072281NC,F. Zell "Mrs. Peel",4,What's not to like. This must have been written on one of her vacations because it is entertaining but involves more dialogue than one may like. Usually she has a large cast of characters but these episodes seem to skate by with a lot of chit chat. Good for a rainy night.
B0072281NC,V. Durost,5,Tommy and Tuppence really are a dynamic duo when it comes to solving or preventing a crime.  Recommended for the whole family
B0072C8RPE,J. Kaplan "JJ",4,I liked it but it's just not as engrossing as other mysteries.  too much striking the cigarette and smoking and trying to be intense.  The actor is &#34;there&#34; - just need better writers (a more intense story) to match David's ability.
B0072C8RPE,Lynda Norton "Highland Enthusiast",4,This program is very much like Law and Order from the English prospective and the laws on the books and how criminals are brought to justice.  Interesting and as most of the English detective programs I have watched...you never know the &#34;who done it&#34; until the very end.  Probably why this program as lasted so long!
B0072C8RPE,muddyboots,5,I have wanted to start this series for a long time so have only did one season.  Hope to be able  to try some of the others.
B0072N7XQC,Chris St Pierre,3,Was not to bad and the plot kept you plugged in enough to keep watching. Sort of a well made B movie.
B0072N8O4M,Lee Lyte,2,I applaud the effort put into this movie and am editing my review after further consideration. The uniqueness of the girl's talent needs upgrading. I believe that would go a long way in increasing interest.
B0072N8O4M,MFJLabs,1,2012NR: You could get just as valid predictive feedback from a well thought-out trailer (aka movie commercial) combined with an internet-based audience poll. Unless of course the intended audience are people who have nothing better to do than to watch a 1hr 37 min commercial about a product that doesn't yet exist. Can anyone say "advance sale on partially built beach front condo's that never complete construction?" ... MFJLabs -1x
B0072QWPSK,JD GAYMAN,5,I can't waite for next season. I will use Amazon more for streaming. The video quality was excellent. I like it better for using my Roku device.
B0073CMRKE,Al "hunter",1,2 groups fighting arguing and in my opinion have nothing to do with weaponry.  I wish they would have included some normal people instead of guys who thinks they're a big shoot.
B0073CMRKE,David A. Bachelder,5,I'm a big fan I really like the show and I'm glad Amazon makes it available.  I'm waiting for season 5 to be released now. I think I'll wait for it to be included with Amazon Prime though.
B0073CMRKE,Sadie,5,Always different and the people who make it on there are very interesting. And Colby is very easy on the eyes!
B0073CMRKE,skiarc,4,I watched the first season and there after and have noticed that the challenges and general format is improving.  I could do with more shooting and less drama but the fact that the producers show the drama makes it more real.  I'd recommend the show.
B0073CMRKE,Wilson Family,5,I think this is our favorite show as a family.  The skills are amazing but it also opens up discussions about how the people behave under pressure and how they treat each other and compete.  Valuable conversations to have with our son.
B0073J5X58,Amanda H.,5,Entertaining and educational! I love this show!!! The cast is is amazing and funny. There is just so much awesome!
B0073J5X58,Brett T Moore,5,I really love this show and this season is just more of the things that made the first 2 great.
B0073J5X58,Camilla Stradley,5,This is an interesting and exciting adventure in the south.  They do a great job of removing the gore and keeping your attention.  You get to know the characters and the culture.  It is very interesting and at times an edge of the seat kind of drama.
B0073J5X58,cottageprims,5,If you need to keep your husband interested and occupied this is the show.The people are down to earth and it's great for the whole family.With the exception of John Paul and his dad I always feel like they are over harvesting to many babies.
B0073J5X58,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,My husband an I love this reality series. We have gotten attached to these hard working real people. So interesting to see how they live and work in the swamp. The Dvd series arrived on time and good quality. Priced right. The whole series cost less than many single videotapes.
B0073J5X58,Judith Pritchard,5,My husband and I watch this series together at least 3 episodes a night when t.v. sucks.  We laugh yet are mesmerized by the people who do this for a living.
B0073J5X58,JULIE DONALD,5,Love this show. Such a funny  and exciting show. Makes you think you are right there with them....trying to catch gaters too
B0073J5X58,Kathleen Rowland,4,I'm personally not a big fan but it is nice to see families working together and passing down traditions.  My husband is the real fan here.
B0073J5X58,Larry,5,always enjoy watching swamp people and the things they do to make a living in the swamps catching gators and ?
B0073J5X58,Michelle DuBose,3,It's interesting to watch how people make a living in a way that is so very different.  Dangerously funny.  Enjoy.
B0073J5X58,Pacific Mitchell,5,The show follows down to earth honest hard working gator hunters in Louisiana.  The people that the show chose are excellent they really pinpointed the right combinations in season 3.  I love watching every family and story.
B0073J5X58,Patrick Highers,5,Found this series to be interesting enough to watch all three seasons so far. A good show for the hunters and fishers out there!
B0073J5X58,Sherri in Georgia,5,My husband and I watch this show together to relax.  These guys and gals really work hard to make their living!
B0073J5X58,Tracy Christensen,5,Can not wait for Season 4 to start.  It is always exciting to see how big &#34;The Big One&#34; is going to be this year.
B0073J5X58,Wendy L. Stivers,5,This season is even better than the last.  Some of the characters have evolved in a positive manner.  These people are a testament to family and community.
B0073J5X58,Whale,5,Great show. You get hooked on the characters. Really like the hard work values and laid back ways of this bunch.
B0074279LU,Charles J. Mcpeak "mcpeak2",5,At long last this show is available!  A childhood favorite!
B0074279LU,Customer,4,While this series did over do it on the action sometimes it was still a very well made and fun cartoon to watch. I would definitely recommend this dvd.
B0074279LU,dennis sohn,5,X-Men is by far one the greatest comic books out there. The story lines were just creative and all the X-Men characters are simply awesome. Glad I watched this series again.
B007427K8W,Adair,5,Tosh is one of the funniest stand ups I have seen. I was glad when the show started and am glad that I have been able to watch a few seasons on Amazon Instant Video.
B007427K8W,Amazon Customer,5,Hilarious summary of all of the best internet videos.  Not politically correct and awesome.  Why waste hours surfing YouTube when you can see the best in a fraction of the time.
B007427K8W,D Dawg,5,Tosh.O makes me laugh everytime I watch it and I am glad it is on amazon prime avaliable for me to watch it thank you
B007427K8W,John C,5,This show is really witty and I like how he pokes fun at his guests without them even being aware that he's mocking them in front of his viewers.  Like all of his nudity too!
B007427K8W,Kindle Customer,4,My husband and I enjoy watching this together.  It's good for something light in the background when you're doing something else...such as browsing Amazon.  :)
B007427K8W,Pflugerville Pete "Amiable Zany",3,Not bad.  It's just a show that gets video from all over the internet and one segment where they invite a person from one of the videos on their show.  Daniel Tosh does an OK job as the host.
B007427K8W,T. J. Foster,5,Tosh isn't for everyone. But if you love crude and rude and politically incorrect humor and weird web redemption's then Tosh is your man.
B007427XS4,A. R. St Jean "ARS",2,Not my kind of comedy. I think that the younger generation may like this more. The whole concept is very thin.
B007427XS4,Devora,5,These guys are too funny for words. I mean lol funny. They touch all ethnic groups because they can love them
B007427XS4,dman,5,Never heard of them but now I can wait to see them again and again. Will have you laugh out loud for sure.
B007427XS4,E. A Dunn "laineyd",4,The first episode was especially awesome but so far each episode has had at least one sketch that has made us laugh out loud.
B007427XS4,Ela,5,Key and Peel - that's the number one reason for the 5 star rating.  Loved these guys on MAD TV and were thrilled to find them on Amazon.
B007427XS4,Jennifer D. Williams,4,This show was very entertaining.  It is definitely not a family show because it contains a decent amount of language.  I offers a great variety of humor.
B007427XS4,Joseph B. Powell,4,They are funny as heck and need to get more props.  They get it in like David Chappell with great skits
B007427XS4,Lee DeBree,3,Many parts are funny but why curse if you know before hand that their going to blip the words out. It seems as though every fourth word is an open space in the dialogue. It gets annoying after awhile.
B007427XS4,Ray "Gray Wolf",4,To be fair I only gave this outstanding comedy four stars because I have only watched two episodes and so I cannot judge the whole season.  If you remember Laugh In with Rowan and Martin from way back when you get somewhat of an essence of what this comedy team is all about.  This is true cross-over comedy as both are bi-racial and the comedy is only richer because of it.  Active and energetic this team brings a new dynamic into comedy.  Skits are good and well thought out and a pleasure to watch.
B007427XS4,Rich,3,I watch a lot of their skits on youtube and I must say they are funny. My only issue is the way the show is put together. I don't want no introduction or monologue. Just feed me the damn cake!!
B007427XS4,swims2me,5,These guys are great. I remember them from Mad TV. They have come along way from then. A Very Good show!!
B007427XS4,V. Aub,4,Key and Peele is a very funny show while also being extremely edgy.  Hopefully they will be able to keep this up for several more seasons.
B00742GOP2,Dennis "barbarosa",2,It hasn't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing. That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is. I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off.I cannot recommend this movie in any way.
B00751IYQ4,David Bower,5,We watched this last night on a hunch and found it to be a treasure. We were not familiar with any of the cast and found them all to be thoroughly enjoyable in their portrayals of the characters in the movie.This has a totally different feel to it and places the viewer very quickly on a remote Scottish island where ordinarily nothing ever happens but that is about to change. The movie reeks with charm and atmosphere and captivated us from the very beginning. After only a few minutes we knew we were in for a completely different sort of film experience and wound up having a lot of fun with the story and the cast.This is suitable for the entire family and provides a fun evening's entertainment; I recommend it highly.
B00751IYQ4,toadknocker,1,This is a tedious slow boring movie of Scottish people trying to be funny....They are not.  I made it 45 minutes before finally turning it off in disgust.  I think the Director's family wrote the rest of these reviews as the seem to have no concept of character development or an interesting story...
B00751JL2K,cozzetta,4,Good movie! Liked it alot! The story line was very good. Christian Slater played a creepy cop alittle to well. The ending was good. Definately a good buy!
B00751JL2K,sonya "i am a fashionista nerd&#62; I am stud...,4,But all the necessary parts are there! I looooooove scary creepy movies! I liked the premise of the movie and also that Christian slater was in it(barely) Instead of looking up a more detailed synopsis I went with the tiny blurb> I usually do not look at anything less than 3 stars no 4 stars to be honest> but I have seen recently so many 4 to 4 1/2 that sucked I said lets try a 3! I liked it so much better than I thought! I put my critical mind to sleep and sat back and rolled with it fun ride creepy antagonist and I mean creepy! A twist so surprising I held my hand to my mouth proclaiming "no way" I haven't done that since the movie " the Crying game" I will definitely watch it again. could give a crap about how horrible of a film an embarrassment! whatever movies are made to entertain us and make us feel different emotions. this film bulls eyed it! if there were better ways to promote it it definitely could have made a profit and a possible sequel. which I think they should maybe they can create a pearl. Its all there figure out how to create it! I think it should become a cult if a bunch of people play it at a Horror party mixed with already seen and not yet! wow could be fun for both parties! sequel sequel Call me its on!!!!!lol thanks I had fun!
B00751JL2K,violet rose,4,i really enjoyed this movie...i watch a lot of horror movies & i thought this had a nice fresh appeal........a little slow in the beggining but it does pick up & it made for a solid good horror movie.....worth checking out !!!
B007943UZ2,Deborah Jones,4,I have always wanted to know what that cult was all about. Now I know. It is very scary and sad to see people getting caught up in that junk instead of focusing on our real God. Very informative.
B007943UZ2,Eric W. Hutcheson "guyseattle",5,This documentary shows who the real cult of scientology is.  And it sheds light on their scams and lies.  L Ron Hubbard is a fraud.
B007943UZ2,Kansas,3,this show I don't think even uncovers half or a third of what scientology is all about and it is also scary that some people are actually brained washed into buying all the B.S. that goes with it.
B0079W7OCY,David Lehmann,5,Setting and casting perfect for story line.  Series of 29 episodes so far all hold you attention. Good for end of tiring day.  Nice to watch- no commercials.
B0079W7OCY,David W. Meadows,4,again the inspector lewis mysteries are exceptionally well written and well acted and the development of the characters and the stars keep me entertained and so much so I purchased the sequels only available through purchase
B0079W7OCY,greg,5,i did not know i would come to love this series as much as i do. its quite progressive and the characters are very well played
B0079W7OCY,H2oxy,5,I love his crustiness and that he struggles with modern gadgets.  He has a great relationship with his partner and his boss attempts to keep these two in check with a firm hand.  Great series.
B0079W7OCY,Hoosier Grandfather,5,The Inspector Lewis series are favorites of ours.
B0079W7OCY,J. C. Miller,4,mysterv lovers wll enjoy inspector lewis.the acting is good and the scenery beautiful.i love englsh mysteries so inpector lewis is right bup my alley
B0079W7OCY,jo ann lovett,4,Laurence Fox is a great actor in any show.  Would watch him in all British television. He and Devin Whately make a great team.
B0079W7OCY,Joycyln Kessler,5,I love these English police shows!  Inspector Lewis and Hathaway are worth the time it takes to watch them.  I get to escape from my hum drum life.
B0079W7OCY,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,I have enjoyed watching this series on Prime.  It is so good to be able to watch these shows on my Kindle or laptop.
B0079W7OCY,Kay Beth Stavley,4,Loved the intelligence quotient of this program.  Kept me guessing and interested.  Will recommend to others for sure for a good program.
B0079W7OCY,M1Hop2,5,It has a different feel than many of the shows in this genre. It's kinda refreshing to watch. Good acting.
B0079W7OCY,mrs natural,5,We decided to check out this out and we were not disappointed. It doesn't have a lot of fast paced action if that is what you want. It is just a simple story of detectives solving a crime.  The do seem to make the plot interesting so you don't get too bored. It is kind of funny that we have to go to another countries TV shows to find something decent. There are too many realty shows going nowadays which we do not care to watch.
B0079W7OCY,Nancy E. Gallagher,5,I loved Inspector Morse and somehow the different combo of Lewis and his new Sargent works rather well.  The counter point of the common man versus Oxford is still there.  I have watched all of them with pleasure.
B0079W7OCY,Rosie,5,A worthy British murder mystery series to watch if you've got nothing better to watch. There's so much rubbish out there.
B0079W7X98,Amorette,5,There is always a surprising twist at the end of the stories and when the guilty person is revealed to the viewer.
B0079W7X98,Annie,5,Wasn't sure if I would enjoy it as much as Morse but it is better. Stories are consistently good and I enjoy his sidekick too.
B0079W7X98,BargainHunter,5,I do love these characters. If I could just learn to turn them off at night and go to bed!!
B0079W7X98,B. Lyn,3,The show would have been better if it were only one hour.  It drags out to fill the time slot and I lose interest.
B0079W7X98,Christine A. Rushbrook,5,I love a good murder mystery and this one of the good ones. Please give us more episodes to enjoy!
B0079W7X98,CO GIRL,5,Such a pleasant way to spend time  Intriguing but not normally showing a lot of bloody scenes.  I really enjoy this but I am an Anglophile.
B0079W7X98,Cynthia W. Wright,5,Excellent!  Morse through Lewis.  Just the best!  Would watch them all over again.  Real acting with no blood and guts.
B0079W7X98,David Lehmann,5,Very enjoyable.  Wish there were more episodes. we use rokau streaming video- works great (no commercials- wonderful).  Incredible scenery old England!
B0079W7X98,David W. Meadows,4,well written and I enjoy the storyline and the cast and especially the layout of the story as the mystery unfolds and is not revealed until the ending /I  appreciate the mystery is the focus and the cast is explored as aside to the show
B0079W7X98,DD "DD",4,It is fun to watch the non intellectual  Inspector Lewis solve the crimes taking place in the Intellectual community of Oxford.Many of the the Oxford community are quite condescending until Inspector Lewis solves the crime.
B0079W7X98,Deanna "Deanna",5,I have always enjoyed the Inspector Lewis series.  The mysteries are interesting and the acting is very good.  I highly recommend this show.
B0079W7X98,Diane Sanford,4,This is a fair program but it was not my very favorite.
B0079W7X98,dokolady "dokolady",5,Kudos to everyone involved in this series.  I never thought I would enjoy a series as I did the &#34;Inspector Morse&#34; series.  This Inspector Lewis series exceeded my expectations.
B0079W7X98,egf,5,Well written and well acted. Have viewed several seasons of this series and have enjoyed them all. Well done and engrossing
B0079W7X98,Evie "book weaver",5,Love Kevin Whately and his co-star.  They are great together.  The mysteries are interesting and challenging to the mind.
B0079W7X98,fchmdpc,5,Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are. Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are.Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are
B0079W7X98,htmcs,5,Really enjoyed this series. The cast and the stories were great. Will go and find the original Inspector Morse  series so I can see inspector Lewis' early days.
B0079W7X98,J. C. Miller,4,i love english mysteries. the plots areinteresting and the actin is good. if you like mysteries you will enjjoy the inpector lewis series
B0079W7X98,Jennifer Faries,5,I like crime stories but I love the British crime stories especially.  There are no really overplayed action parts with guns and 40 people shooting each other.  This is more sleuthing and detective work.  I have watched all 6 seasons of Inspector Lewis and I enjoyed every one.
B0079W7X98,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,The ensemble interaction is first rate.  The stories are well thought out.  Lewis and Hathaway were meant for each other.
B0079W7X98,jo ann lovett,4,I love Laurence Fox.  Saw him act in another series.  Could watch him in anything. I love  British television so much.
B0079W7X98,John,5,This is a very good &#34;Who Don It&#34; movies.  I enjoyed each movie in the Season 2 series.  Most of all it is good for the whole family.  There are no four letter words in this series.  I believe you will enjoy each movie
B0079W7X98,Joycyln Kessler,4,I really like English shows.  This spin off from Morse is a hit.  I really enjoy every part of each series.
B0079W7X98,kathryn,4,I love the whole Morse series I would recommend Lewis with his sharp instincts and his ex-seminarian partner to anyone.
B0079W7X98,Kim,5,The show is just developing.  Its a police show that is enjoyable to watch without a lot of gore.  Inspector Lewis and his partner get along very well and its fun to watch the two of them work together.
B0079W7X98,kindlelover,5,Interesting series from the point of view of an outsider at Oxford...not accepted in the higher education snobbery of Oxford. Both the Inspector and his partner have multi level intriguing character and it is more than just solving the murders. Love it!
B0079W7X98,L. Grueneberg,5,I just love these British mysteries.  The plot is very interesting and many times I am surprises with who done it!  The main characters are human and interesting.
B0079W7X98,Linda,5,Great writing - story plots are really exciting.  I have become a fan.  I will watch them all for sure.
B0079W7X98,M. Davis "Texas Rose",5,Unusual and colorful characters. Love the change from the usual detective series from the U.S. Very addicting. Would recommend to all.
B0079W7X98,M. Webster "None",5,Lewis and Hathaway make a wonderful duo.  I really enjoy watching them work.  I don't really care for Innocent because she is too interested in pleasing the higher ups than really letting Lewis solve crimes.
B0079W7X98,Patricia J. Owen,5,I love English detective shows!  Gives an insight into how the English live.  Most of Detective Lewis' episodes occur right on the campus of Oxford University. So enlightening!
B0079W7X98,Rescue dog lover,5,Continues the great stories of season one.  Same beautiful music and scenery.  And once again Hathaway and Lewis are great together.
B0079W7X98,Roberta,5,I watched Kevin Whately in inspector Morris and I loved the way he balanced the sometimes darker and depressed Morris.  He is down to earth and figures things out just as well as the overly cerebral partners.
B0079W7X98,S. Hewitt,5,I really like all of the programs in this series but watch &#34;And the Moonbeams Kissed the Sea&#34; and &#34;The Quality of Mercy&#34; are my favorites. In other series there are episodes here and there that I just don't watch.
B0079W7X98,S. McDonald,4,I am addicted to Brit police type of series.They do it well!!!This series plays well off the quirks of the main characters.Keep em ' coming!!
B0079W7X98,S. M. Lott "MovieMusic",5,Lewis and Hathaway are very good and good together.  Excellent murder mysteries without being too graphic and gruesom.Can be guessed but not very easily.
B0079W7X98,Ssloane,5,Inspector Lewis is wonderful!  Morse would be proud to see how Lewis carried on after his untimely demise.  Three cheers.
B0079XCKAE,A. Gray "RulesVixen",5,They way she treats people in this season is deplorable. I am only half-way through but I hope she gets what she deserves.She is DISGUSTING.
B0079XCKAE,Elisha C. Douglas,5,I enjoyed this very much.  I was pleasantly surprised that they did men vs. women.  It will be interesting to see if they do it again or if they have something else in mind.
B0079XCKAE,John Egbert "jegbert",3,It starts out slow but the characters become more interesting and likeable. Tarzan boiling his undies in the community pot is classic and worth watching the whole season.
B0079XCKAE,mlsigner "mlsigner",5,Throughly enjoyed it. Survivor always provides fun for anyone of any age and the rewards given can be cultural and provide learning for us.
B0079XCKAE,SC,2,An average season if survivor. After seasons with all returning players it's hard to watch newbies thinking they have slick tricks.
B007A1DSQ0,Carol J. Rader "crdvm",5,I enjoyed this complex mystery when it was on and hoped to find more clues when watching it without comercials.
B007A1DSQ0,MNMJFoley,5,Its's easy to feel for the tortured main character. His confusion and frustration is relayed well by the former Lucius from Harry Potter.
B007A1DSQ0,North Texas Girl,1,There's nothing at all in the first 10 minutes to keep anyone interested.  I bailed early because I was falling asleep.
B007AB6Q28,Rick,2,All the other actors appear in the last few minutes of the movie. I guess if you are a Stephen Dorff fan and enjoy looking up his nostrils for over an hour then this is the movie for you. Tom Berenger is the size of a whale and can't find a tie long enough to reach to his belt. A copy of "Buried" and less interesting. An IFC Film so look for it on Netflix in the next 3 months or so.
B007B9Q8K4,&#34;The Book Crone&#34;,4,If you want to study the psychology of human behavior and be entertained at the same time...this is an interesting way.  When the going is easy the winners are always nice and kind.  When the going gets tough those with character and integrity are easy to spot.
B007B9Q8K4,bruce,4,It is truly amazing what they put these people thru. You really feel for these people when they win or loose.
B007B9Q8K4,Pochassic,5,my wife and I are completely hooked on this show. We sit around and watch entire seasons over the course of a weekend
B007B9Q8K4,Thomas Condon "Film boomer",4,This series has me hooked season-to-season. Phil &#34;the eyebrow&#34; Keoghan is terrific as the host and the producers always seem to have villain-sorts in the competition to keep dramatic tension high.I recommend the series from the first to the last. You can even find Amazing Race originating in other countries (like Australia and Philippines) if you want to see how it's done elsewhere.
B007BECHEK,Doug R. Troupe "drt568",5,Makes you more understand what determines our feelings. Some things you may already know. Many of the things I could identify with.
B007BECHEK,Jimmy Don Johnson,5,I found myself becoming very introspective during this movie.  I really did a great deal of thinking after watching this.  I would happily recommend it and may actually watch it again.  I found it informative as well as uplifting.
B007BECHEK,Tamara J. Christian,5,This was really interesting. I liked seeing how others are very happy in their lives when we might think they are unhappy.
B007BECIVC,Alice,4,I thought this was an excellent assessment of our value system in assessing level of happiness.  I would recommend it to all.  Especially those who believe that you need &#34;things and money&#34; to be happy which are fleeting and temporary.
B007C1K6NQ,Britney,5,My two year old knows his alphabet and sounds with much help from this show. This is the type of programming I like my children to watch. My five year old and two year old are both entertained by it.
B007C1K6NQ,Gennes Council III,5,My son loves it. It gives him another chance to enjoy the stories I grew up with in different ways.  I love it
B007C1K6NQ,Jon O "Health Care Worker",4,I have a 3 1/2 year old and this show is very educational for her. Worth viewing with your child
B007C7UI8S,debra marrero,1,The new vampire and werewolf do nothing for the show... did not enjoy it at all. Miss the other characters they were awesome
B007C7UI8S,Tab,5,Bought all the other season and loved them. Can not wait to watch this season and will be waiting for the next season to come out.
B007C7UI8S,Valerie "exprincess",4,You changed it! Shame on you! It took a whole season for me to really accept the new Mitch. Is his name now Tom?
B007CGN1JM,Erica,5,The acting is at the very highest level. Of course it's only enhanced by perfect costumes and sets. I won't spoil the plot needless to say FUNNY!
B007CGN1JM,Here in ocean city "Melissa",5,5 stars I love it and can watch it over and over it never gets boring. To funny for words actually.
B007CUQ82A,S. M. Lott "MovieMusic",4,They love their kings and queens and it shows up here.  This series cleared up some questions I had about the various &#34;wars&#34; nice to get it at last.
B007EMEG52,1farstar,1,A waste of time and $.  Don't fall for this one.  I didn't mind the waste of $1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time.  =(
B007EMEG52,Snookums062,4,I liked this program because it shows there is always another side to people and things we put on pedestals.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more of the truth about an individual or religion.  Because the whole truth will never be in the history books.  Very interesting and informative.
B007G5GMMC,B. Ying,4,This is a lean adventure film with a measured pace set in the rarely seen Tasmania starring the ageless and ever worth-watchingWilliem Dafoe and supported by a group of able real-life-looking actors.  It is satisfying to watch a well-thought-through film with a good story and A not disappointing ending these days.  If you are not expecting an action adventure but a drama with a good theme then you will not be disappointed.  I would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
B007G5GMMC,Clark A. Lucas II,5,A well played Drama by Mr. Dafoe who sadly realized in the end the only alternative which was very sad.  Shows what we as a society have come to in protecting the environment and the life it supports.
B007G5GMMC,D. M. She,5,This is especially good if you have spent time in the wilderness.  Any wilderness.  Beautifully and hauntingly done.  Glad I watched it.
B007G5GMMC,L. John,3,Great character. Interesting plot. I liked this movie. I would have liked it better if the other characters int he movie had been developed more fully.
B007G5GMMC,Mace & Lacey Gannon,4,Watching this on my Amazon Prime movies was really quite a treat. Much better than a lot of mainstream movies. Actor Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding performance here in this much different type of movie.
B007G5GMMC,Scott Solomon,1,Another Hollywood movie that features a big name actor that turned out to be total crap! I can't imagine why such a notable actor would accept a role in this movie. Is he that hard up for money??? Movie is slow and boring and has very little to do with hunting a rare tiger. Are there no good writers left in Hollywood??? Boring and a total waste of time. Don't spend a penny on this film. Shame on you Hollywood!!!
B007G5GMMC,sharon,5,Enjoyed! It's not hard to appreciate a movie like this due to its impressive cinematography and direction as well as a great performance by Willem Dafoe and cast.
B007G5H2X0,Edward,1,one of the worst movies of all the time...terrible movie..who wrote this movie??? the director must be shooooot himself...this is a low cheap budget movie terrible...stay away...
B007G5H2X0,L. JOURNELL "bULLETT",1,this movie was so bad....dont want to waste time explaining it...good concept?!?! but ultimately really really awful.thank god it was free.
B007G5H2X0,Marco,5,a tense but also repetitive thriller that is worth watching. Ending is great & disturbing. I give it a B. worth a watch
B007G5H2X0,violet rose,4,great horror movie.....it was worth the 9.99 i spent on it when it came out........very entertaining.....good amount of blood scenes.........kind of a twisty ending....i liked it !!!
B007H63DRW,Hope - California,5,I am so sorry this has ended.  It was wonderfully entertaining.  I am going to watch it again very soon because it made me laugh so hard.  That last episode in the desert was a scream.  The writers of this show are very creative with the most bizarre and interesting plots.  I am puzzled as to why it was cancelled after only one season.  The whacky characters and episodes grew more endearing to me with each disc.  Thanks for all the zany fun.  Come back!  Come back!
B007H63DRW,Michelle "Navy Gunner",5,Good Christian B****es indeed.  This is a good comedy drama with some good acting. They did a good job in exaggerating the Texan big hair and gun crazy attitude. But wait - maybe it's not much of an exaggeration. LOL.Canceled due to the group One Million Moms - FU group. No longer respect this group.
B007H63DRW,The Big G. Spot "The Big G. Spot",5,Another show they took off much too soon my Mother loved this show and the networks canceled it after one season but at least she can watch them on dvd now.
B007HDPJSG,Donna L. Sako,1,The theme was boring. The actors/experts were boring. There was no story line. I left the movie after 30 minutes.
B007HGY0S8,Anne Lee,5,Army Wives never failed to grab my attention. I loved all the characters especially the dynamics between the different couples profiled in this drama. I asked a woman who had experience as a military wife and she confirmed that Army Wives is very true to the lives of the spouses left behind to bear the burden (and experiencing the joys) of raising children alone while their spouse was across the world serving our great country.
B007HGY0S8,Belizelovely,5,I had to move to Germany when this season started & hated to miss it. I too am an Air Force Wife & can relate to 90% of these storylines. I love them & can't wait fir season 7 to start.
B007HGY0S8,Pamela S. Halbig,5,This on going story about Army life and family and friends is great. You feel part of the tribe.  love the story.
B007HYMHEE,bruce,4,These guys give a slightly new spin to the series of auctions. They are able to keep the subject enjoyable
B007HYMHEE,Buddyjay,2,The show is too scripted. A reality show is SUPPOSED to be off the &#34;cuff&#34; and spontaneous. This show is too scripted. And why is Roy Williams (one of the dirtiest football players that ever played) on the show? He's an absolute idiot!Talk about scripted...when was the last time YOU were able to walk right up to a famous athletes house and ring his door bell?What a crock.
B007HYMHEE,greg,5,This is one of the best storage bidding shows out there. I think much of the Items they find could indeed be found in a storage locker.
B007HYMHEE,K. R. Merryman,4,The characters in this show are... well... different!  In a good way!  It is hard to believe what people leave in the storage lockers to be sold off.  Everything is bigger in Texas and some of the items found have big value to the trained eye.
B007JF83YY,A. Fast,5,I enjoyed this show from the first one I watched and will continue buying the season DVDs to watch uninterrupted by commercials until they quit making them.
B007JF83YY,aloha1127,5,A little over the top but aren't all reality shows?This is just plain good fun and silliness with actual good family values.
B007JF83YY,Amazon Customer,5,Absolutely love this show and I usually hate reality tv. This family is so funny it is better than most sitcoms on the air. Also love that they end each show with family and friends gathered around for a huge dinner and give thanks for all their blessings
B007JF83YY,Amazon Customer,4,I put off watching this show because it appears to be ridiculous.  Well guess what? It is. Ridiculously funny! I caught myself laughing out loud numerous times. This is a great family and a great show. I'm only sorry I didn't fall in love with them sooner.
B007JF83YY,Angie,5,Unbelievably unique family with very cute grandkids. Just corny enough to make you laugh and no bad language. Good family entertainment with a conservative philosophy that does not match their appearance. They must be rolling in money if the spin off products in the stores is any indication.
B007JF83YY,artsieann,4,I wouldn't watch it for a long time. My husband wanted to watch it. I watched it with him and I loved it. It is very funny and you fall in love with the people.
B007JF83YY,BarbaraKButler,5,This is a family who is down to earth and loyal although sometimes get a bit carried away in some of their antics. So what? I love them all.
B007JF83YY,B. Edmondson,5,The episodes have great fun in them for every member of the family.  They have great religious beliefs and great family values.
B007JF83YY,Brenda Santiago,5,I am a pure city girl and for some reason this reality show I love!!! I love each person on the show and the old fashion moral and values the parents to the children uphold till this day knowing and having the knowledge that their son's and wives are changing with the times... including their children... and I love the end of each show how they always pray about the togetherness of the family  ... no matter what they went thru that day...
B007JF83YY,Brett T Moore,5,I thought it was going to be like most other reality shows but it's seriously funny!  some of it is scripted but it's all pretty good.
B007JF83YY,CARRIE,5,This is so funny to watch especially when you know they are so rich and yet they are rednecks at heart and still catch their food and do alot of things theirselves while teaching the young ones how to keep the traditions.
B007JF83YY,Cindy Gentry,5,This is a funny show of an everyday family that runs their own business but puts fun 1st. They also are not afraid to show their love of God and family through out the series
B007JF83YY,Constance,5,I absolutely love Duck Dynasty so i had to buy the season. I haven't watched it on the DVD yet but I know the episodes are good because I have seen them all on tv. I would definitely recommend this show.
B007JF83YY,Dawna324,5,I love love love this show. I did not start watching it from the beginning but I caught one or two episodes on TV and really liked it so I watched season 1 on Amazon and I love every show. If every family were like this one America would be a really fun place to live in my opinion. Getting readsy to watch season 2 now. Hope it is as good as season 1.
B007JF83YY,DD "DD",4,A reality show that is actually fun and interesting to watch. I enjoy all of the characters and they are all some real &#34;characters.&#34;
B007JF83YY,Debra A. Ward,5,Love seeing the family interaction. It's nice to sit down with the family and know we aren't going to be slammed with bad language or sex or violence.
B007JF83YY,Desiree Merrick,3,Very funny show.  Intelligent witty family.  I cannot afford the cost of the prime membership and to pay individually for the episodes.  But if they were included in my membership I would definitely watch.
B007JF83YY,D. L. Cheever,5,These guys epitomize the concept of good old redneck boys for me and the rivalry between the brothers and Sy is hard to beat.
B007JF83YY,Eric J. Fridman "ejf302",5,I really enjoy this show.  I was skeptical but it kinda grows on you.  I was watching it in HD on my new HDX 8.9 and the picture quality was outstanding.
B007JF83YY,Flannel Quilter,5,People at work were talking about this show and so I thought I would check it out. I laugh during every episode.I highly recommend.
B007JF83YY,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,We loved Duck Dynasty!  People are craving good clean entertainment and this is it!  People drawn to  this show are a majority of Americans that honor God and their country.
B007JF83YY,gary seamon,4,it's nice to see a Christian base family on television again. that like to play with guns and fish.  We need more shows like this one. Philip Robertson is my hero.
B007JF83YY,Janet Atkinson - Q15J,5,I think there's a little Phil or Miss Kay in each of us.  What a wonderful family--they exhibit true Christianity in their dealings with each other.  We could all learn from that.
B007JF83YY,Jennifer D. Williams,5,I enjoy watching this show.  It is clean and provides a great family time following! I am a people water and I enjoy learning about other people's prospective on life.
B007JF83YY,Kathleen Rowland,4,It's fun to get a glimpse into a totally different culture.  Glad for the Christian stand they take in some issues.  That's refreshing.  Some of the episodes are totally hilarious.
B007JF83YY,Kathy A.,5,I love Duck Dynasty!  Love the characters and love the prayer at the table at each meal.  The only thing I'd like differently is if Phil and Miss Kay wouldn't talk about sex quite as much.
B007JF83YY,Kerry A. Barndt,5,My husband watched this; he loves Duck Dynasty and will be watching all of them.  I watch when I can; they're very amusing.
B007JF83YY,K. Garrety "kellysb00kz",4,It's interesting to see these characters show who they really are behind the fancy clothes and money.I find it entertaining though sometimes I can't watch like when they show animals being prepared for meals.
B007JF83YY,Kungfujackrabbit,5,This show is hilarious with a touch of old time family values. We loved it! We will be purchasing season two next.
B007JF83YY,Laura,5,Humorous. Light hearted and fun to watch. Clean show that you can watch as a family. I would highly recommend it.
B007JF83YY,L. Hossler "LSH",5,Quality show and safe and fun entertainment for the whole family.  There are not many shows out there that you can say this about.  A & E had better keep with this show or another network will have no trouble scooping them up into their line up. :)
B007JF83YY,Linda Pawson,5,This is a great DVD.  It is clear and has good sound.  The episodes are very funny.The product arrived in a safe package.  No problems with shipping.  It arrived ontime as stated.  I would highly recommend this product.  I also would not hesitateto purchase future merchandise from this seller.
B007JF83YY,Lizzie,5,great family normalities! nice to see siblings doing normal things and makes the point about how different we all are even within the tight familyl
B007JF83YY,Lois,5,Again  it is Duck Dynasty and I really Love watching this series and the family working together and the Godly concept it is awesome and wished we had more like it..
B007JF83YY,lucy1895,5,First reality show that I ever watched.  I know that reality is scripted - then filmed.  I enjoyed the stories and liked the people.  Watching a family that loves each other without negative events was delightful.
B007JF83YY,Marie "Marie",5,I am totally in love with some of the family members.  I find it a fun and entertaining show to watch.
B007JF83YY,mbyers,5,Love it!!! Wholesome fun! We watch it over and over again! Great for the whole family! Love the prayer and moral at the end!
B007JF83YY,michaelaen_37841,5,My in Laws are just like them when you come from the south you do alot of the same canning and living off the land alot you grow and hunt your way all year round this is just the best show I have ever watched showing that and funny to boot
B007JF83YY,Michelle DuBose,5,Great show.  Love the close knit family.  Makes you smile over and over again. Feel good entertainment for the whole family.
B007JF83YY,M. Marks,5,This show is hilarious. So many funny and endearing characters. I hope the subsequent seasons come onto Amazon Prime Instant.
B007JF83YY,MokaChik,4,Good clean family funWe can all enjoy it together and we all laugh at different things.I wish more under armour was worn... Not
B007JF83YY,Monica A. Sloan,5,Never thought I'd like such a show but this just shows one what one can expect with great actors and good writing!  Both are a must for good entertainment and this is it!
B007JF83YY,Nana4,3,I kept hearing about Duck Dynasty and wanted to find out what it was all about. This was a good introduction to the family and each role they play in the business and family.
B007JF83YY,neon,4,its is very unique show and very unusual family doing business a very low key way and making top notch dollars.
B007JF83YY,night player,5,I wondered what all the excitement was recently when the show was threatened with cancellation. Then I saw the first episode. I think I am addicted as I watched the whole first season in two days. What a family. The one thing that stands out by not being present is the lack of profanity. Has some great moral values that many could do well to believe in. When is Season 2 going to be available on Prime?
B007JF83YY,Nurse Sandie,5,Love their principles and values.  God fearing just like me.Good work ethic just like me.  This is my kind of show.
B007JF83YY,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,This show is really funny and family oriented.  Just started watching and now I'm hooked.  I love the fact that old fashion values and a family that actually loves and respects one another is such a hit.
B007JF83YY,readinglarge,5,Whether you share their particular beliefs or not let your inner red neck flag fly because this show is too funny to miss!
B007JF83YY,rmkjbg6,5,Fun show with good family values.  Lots of stuff to make you laugh.  Just a nice feel good show. Love Phil and the advice he gives his grandkids.
B007JF83YY,RPC,5,I love this show. at first I thought another stupid reality show wtf. but I watched it and laughed my ass off
B007JF83YY,Serenity,5,This show was such a cute surprise for me who is not a &#34;hunting for sport&#34; advocate.  This did give me insight into families that do such a thing along with their values and their points of view.  Love the characters & family dynamics.
B007JF83YY,S. Guest "A Mom of Two Soldiers",1,I'm not a big fan of reality shows and I don't watch them regularly.  I saw 15 minutes of one episode and it was too much. Scratch this one off the list.
B007JF83YY,Sherrie McGovern "Sherrie",5,Love having season one!  This show and amazon tv have an excellent selection of the best movies and shows of any other smart tv app
B007JF83YY,Snookums062,2,I only looked at this program to find out what all the hype was about.  This program is not for me personally.  It's good to have choices of what you can look at; but this program will never be tuned in on my television again.  Different strokes for different folks.
B007JF83YY,S. S. "Super",5,I am kind of surprised at how they don't seem to be affected by the cameras being around.  This is a good show and fine for children.
B007JF83YY,S. Thiel "Sanpan",3,This show is funny and entertaining. Its amazing how one son takes the business from small to very successful.  Duck calls.....amazing!
B007JF83YY,Stinky Greg,5,This more than met my expectations. It is exactly what I anticipated receiving and is very well made. Should the need arise I would purchase this item again. Not only is the Roberston family funny and entertaining they are also very inspiring. Everyone should see this show.
B007JF83YY,susan,4,he must like it cause i own a lot of episodes i watched one it was the chirstmas but  what season i dont know
B007JF83YY,susan stewart,2,Didn't care for it - just too stupid for me. Maybe if I watched more of it but so far it wasn't worth my time.
B007JF83YY,Ted Robbins,3,Hokey for the sake of hokiness. I will continue to watch because I suspect that somewhere in my psyche lurks a redneck.
B007JF83YY,todd,5,this is one of my favorite shows of all time and i love the actors and the what they do for a living it is great....
B007JF83YY,victoria,3,I personally didn't  care too much for this one. I mean it was ok and if I had watched more than just one episode I may have really like it . So I really can't be a good judge of this series because I didn't watch more than one of them. It seems to be popular from what I've heard other from other people. Give it a try yourself. You may like it.
B007JF83YY,webbsb,5,It is a very funny and family friendly show.  You will never have to worry about allowing your children to watch.
B007JF83YY,Wimpy Charley "Wimpy",5,It comes in with excellent condition.  And it comes with 2 discs.  And this shows is very funny.  I also have season 2 and 3.  Am expecting Season 4 sometimes soon.
B007JF83YY,Woody,5,Popular for a reason. Highly entertaining. Better than most reality shows. No over the top fake drama. You will grow to love these guys!
B007JF8G9Q,alllie,5,Both the making of the bread and the aluminum foil look like dirty processes.  They never show the foil being washed at any point. And the production line for the bread looks dirty as well.
B007JF8G9Q,Carole M,4,It's always interesting to see how things we take for granted are made.  This series is okay but seems to be aimed at people with very short attention spans.  Mr. Rogers did a much better job on his field trips on his show.
B007JF8G9Q,DENISE NAVARRO,5,I just love this show it is very interesting and informative. I like how they show you in detail how they make everyday products.
B007JF8G9Q,Jenny,5,I have always wondered how things are made and this show is great. I have learned a lot from this show
B007JF8G9Q,K. D. Fortune "Ken Fortune",5,This is one great show about how inventive people can be--but the best part is being able to go show by show and findout about how something you are interested in is made.
B007JF8G9Q,K. Garrety "kellysb00kz",5,I really enjoy watching how things are made.The narrator keeps thing moving with many interesting facts to keep your mind focused.
B007JF8G9Q,mrs natural,5,My husband and I like to watch this show because it is very informative. Also something to watch when nothing else on tv.
B007JF8G9Q,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,love it!!!!! i used to have dish tv & WHEN THIS WAS ON I LOVED IT( DISH TO  MUCH$$$$$...SO WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON PRIME I SNATCHED IT UP.....
B007JF8G9Q,Striving4Excellence,5,I Love this show. Extremely happy to find it on Amazon Prime.It is a safe show for children to watch and learn about everyday items.I have learned quite a bit watching it with my children.I am sad that there are not more seasons to watch.Netflix canceled the show.
B007JF9DB6,Amazon Customer,4,It's an interesting but very simplified explanation of how things are made. The cover 3 or 4 things in each episode so explanations are pretty simple.
B007JF9DB6,Desiree Merrick,4,Who has never asked themselves how something is made?  I wish Amazon would find a way to get Made in America the series avaliable.  The one that took you from place to place showing how and where items were made in America.
B007JF9DB6,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",3,Somewhere in the middle of Season 3 of these series the Video presentation format got changed from 4:3 to wide-screen however the screen does not fully fit a 16:9 aspect ratio TVs and is seen to be presented in a 'windowboxed' format which I hated. I had to constantly flip my TV's aspect ratio to 'wide-screen fit' & 16:9 ratio between episodes. I even checked with my KindleFire tablet and that also suffered the same  Window boxed image quality which is why I am rating this with 3 stars. BTW Season 5 is awesome as it is available in Hi-Def!
B007L8N42A,Bryan,5,South park is a classic that I hope never goes away. This season is no different. It has the zip line episode where they go live action for a minute. Loved it.
B007L8N42A,Dwight,3,a tedious episode but a great song that should be for sale on itunes and as a ringtone but it is NOT.The music video is absolutely adorable - about ten minutes into the episode but the episode itself is SO tedious. Butters is such a wuss so no wonder he has a creepy grandma in addition to having creepy parents.  Blech.
B007L8N42A,Jamie Hensley,5,always good.
B007L8N42A,Ronault D. Trowbridge,4,South Park continues to crank out the seasons & still manage to feel fresh I love the &#34;Raising the Bar&#34; & &#34;A Nightmare on Face time&#34; episodes.
B007LVT9SA,Cocorah,5,I really enjoyed this whole series.  I like series that have strong female leads and this one was great.  I am very sorry to see it end.
B007LVT9SA,Gary W. Crane "Movie Lover",5,I feel this is a great TV series and just want to keep my collection complete. If you haven't seen any of the show try season 1 and check it out for yourself.
B007LVT9SA,Jen Sites,5,In plain sight has been one of my favorite shows since the first episode. Now I finally have all five seasons. I love Mary and Marshall so much.  I hate that they only had five seasons. It is a awesome show.
B007LVT9SA,J. Ligon "JimL",5,This was one of the best series on TV and I really hated to see the series end. Really Good!
B007LVT9SA,L. Carson "L Carson",5,I don't understand why they took it off the air!  Would love to see how Marshall Mann runs the office and how Mary''s life turns around AND who's Squish's baby's father?  Is it  Peter?  Will they get back together?  She's not as far away from his lowly beginnings as she thinks.!
B007LVT9SA,Marcia Wenbert,4,I find it interesting to see the potential areas of how life would be affected by witness protection.  Following the lives of the base characters and the twist and turns they take keep me entertained as well.  Good acting without being too heavy.
B007LVT9SA,MWOO,5,I don't know how they got such a good cast of characters but they did.I will miss the program.  Mary and Marshall Marshall were the best.
B007LVT9SA,S. Cowan,5,Mary and Marshall Marshal have been hiding those people so well for years now. Love the series and the interaction between characters.
B007LVT9SA,sewready,5,This is a really nice show that did not last as long as it should. Try hard not to miss it.
B007LVT9SA,W. Simons "Wendi8",4,The only reason I don't give this five stars is because the series ended too soon and not at all the way I had hoped.  But every episode was a lesson in how a TV series should be done.  Great acting.
B007MHB990,Britney,5,My six year old daughter and I love to watch these together.  I feel as though it is more appropriate then any Hannah Montana or anything else kids are watching these days and the show gives us all sorts of things to talk about from history to clothing.  this show is so fun and I love sharing it.
B007MHB990,DM "dm",5,I watched the program and enjoyed every moment of it.  the clarity is great.  It is so nice to watch TV from waaaaay back.  Thank you.
B007MHB990,FolkLore,5,How can you ever go wrong with I Love Lucy?  This will always be one of the best shows ever made.
B007MHB990,Larry,1,I enjoyed the shows and now every time I try to access one it says c content not available this is not the show rather something with Amazon
B007MHB990,norma jean kringer,5,Who can deny that these shows are so part of this country's history.  How many times do we do a &#34;Lucy&#34; line during the day?
B007MHB990,starshining4ever,4,Great show! Hilarious too. Lucy keeps getting into trouble but usually learns a good lesson. Love the depiction of mid-1900s Americana!
B007MHB990,Wayne A. Seavolt,5,This is a great show where the couple are a solid family.  There is no sneaking around or drug use it shows family values and in the end a love for each other.
B007MJSPJA,gustavo a lopez,3,typical vampire themes except that in this case the vampire is a girl in an all girls preppy high school. You have your typical sexual tension between the vampire and the girls plus tension between the heroine and the only male teacher in school. ending was predictable
B007MS58AA,eric,5,Les Stroud is one of the best if not the best of the survival instructors.HE films alone and is by himself in this series for7 days in the newest ones 10 days.He has really helpful advice and lives the life he portrays.Even  has his own knife brand with camillius and the only reason i bought a camellius is because he helped design and set the specs really is a great buy ( i suggest the artic)  S how is entertaining and informative.two thumbs up.
B007MS58AA,pd,5,Les does this this BY HIM SELF. There is no camera crew. He hauls around 50 lbs of photo gear besides survival in some tough situiations. Very entertaining and educational.
B007MS58AA,Texman,5,Survivorman test his resolve in facing survival in the wilderness with little or no resources and while doing all the filming himself. Well filmed and edited keeping a viewers interest throughout the episode and very entertaining.
B007MXEJU0,Diana Strole,5,I love all these true crime series on Investigation Discovery!  It's amazing at the amount of evil people there are out there.
B007MXEJU0,Shelly Iniguez,5,Love this show!! It opens your eyes to the sick things that people do and I think that it helps you to become more aware so that you are not a victim too!! You watch one and then you cant stop!! Great show!!
B007N4BTEW,Becky M. Brooks,5,Haven't seen ILL for years upon years. The show is no worse for the wear in spite of being 60+ years old.
B007N4BTEW,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,Who doesn't Love Lucy? This show was and still is a funny show that the whole family can enjoy. The best of the best.
B007N4BTEW,Carol,4,Lucy can always make you laugh at yourself as she does it so well. She is an amazing and wonderful gift to all of us!
B007N4BTEW,Cub,5,You would have to be comatose not to like the comedy of Lucy and Desi Arnaz.  I sure hope we are piping their comedy throughout the galaxy. It's a sure fire way to maintain cosmic harmony.
B007N4BTEW,Debbie Dillon,5,I have introduced I Love Lucy to my 11 year old granddaughter and she loves it. She laughs and it is so nice to be able to show her TV shows that have no inappropriate moments.
B007N4BTEW,DM "dm",5,This was a great series to watch.  Lucy is so funny and entertaining.  The picture display was clear and I truly enjoyed this program.  Thank you.
B007N4BTEW,E. arroyo "papa che",5,Another classic from all time greats. Laughter is  so easy when watching Lucy and the gang do their thing. So  funny.
B007N4BTEW,Eric Barreto "Eric B.",5,I Love Lucy is a timeless treasure.  It's what all sitcoms of today aspire to be. I can never get tired of enjoying the antics of the frowzy redhead and her friends.
B007N4BTEW,Gina,5,I Love Lucy is a classic! Absolutely timeless. The humor is well executed. The show is light hearted and delightful. i Definitely could do a 'i Love Lucy' marathon.
B007N4BTEW,Holly,5,I love Lucy is great classic tv. Still makes me laugh no matter how many times I've seen the episodes!
B007N4BTEW,Jeff Riley,5,I truly love Lucy. It is the only show from those days that is still funny to people in general. It is what all the comedy shows steal from today.
B007N4BTEW,KEN,5,Great humor. Always was a big fan. They don't make them like this any more. Glad to have the time with family.
B007N4BTEW,K. Garrety "kellysb00kz",5,It's great to watch real comedy.  A good comedy makes us relax and feel good about being alive.Theses old comedies were created by people who knew what makes a person laugh.If only modern producers could accomplish what the Lucy show got done.
B007N4BTEW,K. Hopkins "K Hopkins",5,&#34;I Love Lucy&#34; always has been and always will be an all time favorite.  She and Ricky were true innovators of their time.  Still hilarious after all these years.
B007N4BTEW,Kirk,5,after all these years and even after watching the shows over and over... Lucy and crew are still the funniest!!!
B007N4BTEW,norma jean kringer,5,I doubt if anybody could give this historical sit com anything but 5 stars.  We all grew up with Lucy and my children watch Lucy and now my grandchildren are watching Lucy.  A day hardly goes by without a Lucy line for the day.  This is an American Icon.
B007N4BTEW,Pat,4,One of the best memories of my childhood is getting to watch this show! It hasn't lost its' charm although those days are quite distant now.
B007N4BTEW,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,I Love Lucy never gets old. I have been seeing episodes since I was a kid and even today they do make you laugh. The HD version is digitized superbly and while the aspect ratio is 4:3 the black & white nostalgic comedy in this series can entertain anyone who has love for Lucy. Five Stars!
B007N4BTEW,starshining4ever,4,Love watching &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; with the family. It's a great way to unwind at the end of the day.
B007NYO4GM,A. J. Minhas "althotos",4,An interesting look at the forces of Nature and how they are constantly reshaping our planet. A well done documentary.
B007NYO4GM,Diane "Geepa",5,Talk about timely. Several episodes were so current that I just saw parts on today's news. Fantastic filming. Just spectacular
B007NYO4GM,Jennifer D. Williams,5,I loved every minute of this program.  It was stunning and educational.  I wish there were more seasons available to watch.  You will not be disappointed!!
B007NYO4GM,Kevin burns "kevin Burns",5,5 stars on this one my personal favorite is tornados super amazing to see mother nature destoy all then volcanoes i just dont feel bad for people who live by one and there house is burned up what did you expect but very good scenes of all of natures fury highly recommend
B007NYO4GM,mari franks,5,Definitely an amazing. My 13 yro said this is just like school stuff. My 5 yro thought it was awesome. A show that was informing and interesting. Couldn't stop watching it.
B007NYO4GM,norma jean kringer,5,Just think.  This is history and seems it just gets worse as it goes along.  Filming it is going to pretty hard soon.  I sure enjoyed this footage.  We don't live in a fairy tale world.
B007NYO4GM,Sophea Uk "sopheasinferno",5,Very entertaining and informative. My nephew loves this a lot. He remembers a lot of information from this. Worth watching.
B007NYOJXK,grace,5,real life presentation.  excellent quality which is usual for ID.  easy to follow cases and issues related to interrogation.  if you like detective stories etc. this is right up that alley.
B007NYOJXK,Janet Lynn,2,Low grade film not very interesting to watch. Story does not build up. Other shows like 48 hours has better interviews.
B007NYOJXK,Success,4,Pretty good show. Highlights real interrogation techniques used by the police to get the information they need to solve crimes.
B007O2TG6Q,Alex Colby,5,I used to live in Indy briefly so a tiny connection. That aside to watch such a dedicated professional team at work is a learning experience. I didn't think I'd like such a reality program but it's done well. You never see disturbing pictures of the deceased. So for anyone interested in real detective or forensic work this is a good way to see it in action.
B007O2TG6Q,Jeni,5,I like this show because of how real it is. you follow the detectives on each case from start to end. the city of Indianapolis has the most solved murder cases in the United States. I wouldn't recommend watching if you have a sensitive stomach.
B007O2TG6Q,K. Schonlau "MysteriesinStL",5,I pulled this off Amazon Prime and I had never seen the series and wanted to expose myself to new dramas.  The Shift is a realistic view of police work and procedures.  It reminds me a bit of 48 Hours but with more depth.  I like this series and wish I had seen it before.  It is well worth viewing.  For adults.
B007O2TG6Q,Patricia M. Brown,2,Don't like real cop or drama shows. If you do you would like this because it shows how the cops handle a homiside.
B007O62JG6,Camilla Stradley,3,Very cute.  Much shorter than I realized but worth the watch.  It is great for parents that want something short to settle the kids down before bed.
B007O62JG6,Kellie V. Bravender "kvbravender",5,I love Maximus in the movie Tangled!! This is a great way to get a &#34;Maximus Fix&#34; when you don't have time to watch the entire movie.  My boys and I will watch it when we need a laugh....
B007O62JG6,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,vjnmhrg;h lndsfg;okhi d;jfnhgtoeruihj lkjsdlfio jajghoshi khsdtrhjo'i jlakhdgrkjh klagtrjkl'j lkdsnrtylorhjo ijlektj blkjtrl'ykhje'kj lknsfhytrlkhn ljknsghjytr'lkj lkjstl'rkyjl'kj lklgtkjhytrlj lkjtrylkrjlkj ltkjyrkjd lkftrylkrjl jlkjtrylrkgj fhj
B007O62JG6,SuperDad "SuperDad",5,The only thing I didn't like was that it was too short. 7 minutes of fun for the whole family.
B007OKD3GC,Andre Villemaire,1,I am a sucker that wasted my money by going with the cover picture (the statue ofLiberty pounded by flaming meteors ). Cool picture..could be a good film....NOTSad ...very Sad...  and you will be very sad if you waste any of your qualitytime for this piece of turd.Watched 5 minutes...fowarded the rest...then straight for the Garbage...No regrets on the money that i lost...I think this Studio....is worse that Asylum....can you believe that....im startingtoo.................
B007ORTYKO,babydoc,3,It's a pretty good show. It shows all aspecs of a murder from a torn family to the detectives trying to solve the case.
B007ORTYKO,Bob Morton,4,First & Second season were good. Reaslistic in many ways.I'll give a ONE  star to the third season. BAD!
B007ORTYKO,chance,5,This series continues to be intriguing. A glimpse into the personal hells of characters circled within the ripples of a young woman's murder. Just when things become obvious the focus eclipses. Layers peel back upon layers. We have to forgive our heroes their sins. We have to rethink our conclusions. Everyone is breaking the rules a little. And the rules are breaking everyone. You find it slow? I find it intense!!!
B007ORTYKO,Constance,5,Revelations from season one into season 2 could have not been done better. Takes a lot to keep me guessing but The Killing nails it. Unfortunately there are too many people needing instant gratification so AMC is not renewing a 3rd Season. So with that said my parting words are " IDIOTS at AMC you have disappointed a lot of fans"....................update: YEAH!!! The Killing was picked up for Season 3!!! AMC listened to the fans :)Season 3 starts tonight 02June2013
B007ORTYKO,Crusader,5,Never a dull moment and lots of twists and turns to keep most viewers on the edge of their seats.  Cannot wait for the next season.  Writing and acting is very good.
B007ORTYKO,Danar "Ardent Booky",4,The Killing ended after this second season. That was the worst part about this series. My husband and I watched the first season on Netflix's but they did not have the second season so we purchased it from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for allowing us to know how this story ended and exactly who the killer was or killer(s) were.
B007ORTYKO,Denise Brown "Have a blessed day!",5,ok this episode starts out kinda slow...but then OMG!!! the secrets the Larson family  keep slowly start to come out! i love this show and each episode is better than the last!
B007ORTYKO,Donna K. Ford "English Mystery Collector",5,This is a great show!  The characters are memorable though low key.  The story is greatand keeps you wanting to see the next one.
B007ORTYKO,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",4,Each episode gets us closer to the answer (most of the time) but the mystery is unraveling faster and faster.
B007ORTYKO,Ernie Fordham,5,Excellent and suspenseful entertainment! I have enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2 and look forward to Season 3. Even my wife likes it!
B007ORTYKO,Eugene Gutierrez,5,For those of you that stayed with the show through Season 1 your reward comes in Season 2.  Go ahead and buy the whole season because it doesn't conclude until the very last show.  It's worth it.  I don't know how.  A ginger in the lead and a partner who epitomizes a meth-head should not have a great cop show by any formula I can understand!!  It was so worth it to buy both seasons!  Enjoy.  You will not figure it out until the end.
B007ORTYKO,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",5,Great season ending.  Lots of action throughout the episodes and really moved faster along the plot than season 1.  Good character acting by all.
B007ORTYKO,Julie Vickery,5,The Killing is definitely a cut above the rest. Excellent writing and performances make for a very satisfying tale. I look forward to season 3.
B007ORTYKO,L. Carlson "lovemykindle",5,We really enjoy this show. We really love the character of Stephen Holder. We had never seen the actors who play detective Sarah Linden and detective Holder but they prove to very good actors. The show kept us at the edge of our seat and wanting more so we would watch 3 or 4 episodes at a time! Our favorite season is season three.
B007ORTYKO,mjordan,5,This is a very good crime drama.  However you do need to see every episode from season one to keep up with the whole plot.of season two.  Each episode is a day of the investigation into a murder of a young woman that took place during season one.  The show has a lot of twist and turns until you finally find out WHO DID IT.
B007ORTYKO,Nancy G. Hutchison "addicted to mysteries",5,What a great series.  This is one that sticks with you for a long time.  Great acting with plenty of twists to keep you guessing.  The political plot developed and then joined the murder plot.  I recommend it.
B007ORTYKO,Northerngal,5,I found this show quite by accident and quickly became caught up in the storyline.  I am so glad to hear there will be more seasons!
B007ORTYKO,Nuttya22,5,Just as good if not better than the first season!!!  Love how the second season is a continuation of the first season....same case...short amount of time has gone by. This show just gets better and better!!!
B007ORTYKO,OWEN R. MILLER,5,Excellent Story line - Excellent writing - And EXCELLENT acting. Came across the series by accident while searching for another. Best find I ever had.
B007ORTYKO,Rev.Carolyn J. White,5,I very much enjoyed this series.  I enjoyed the female lead.  A no nonsense sort of woman.  Very intelligent portrayal.
B007ORTYKO,Romona Burton,5,Excellent.  Suspenseful with a great story lines and great  acting.  So sorry that the series ended. I hope that the series makes a return.
B007ORTYKO,Younggrandma,5,This murder mystery was well worth my time even though it was a bit depressing at times.  The characters are multidimensional and its is almost impossible to figure out who the killer might be.  There are many surprises and twists along the way.
B007OV0UYY,Customer,1,This show is unwatchable and horribly acted. It is also extremely boring and not funny in the slightest. Don't waste your money on this crap.
B007OV0UYY,LADONNA HARVEY "LaHarvey",5,This show still grabs my kids' attention after years of watching episode after episode. They can watch these episodes several times.
B007OV0UYY,Michael Gallagher,4,iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $28.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!
B007PKOKZY,B. Lyn,3,I thought the makeup & costuming of the mechanical man was good.  Amazing he could stay still so long but the story line lacked zing.  The story was okay but I guess it moved too slowly for me.
B007PKOKZY,Craig S. Werner "The Grumpy Old Squid",4,Not your ordinary movie.  It tells a story and portrays the difficulty of life for those who do not travel the traditional path of the 9 to 5 working life.
B007PKOKZY,LibraryFriends,5,Really touching film about two souls muddling through life and then they found each other.  Very sweet little film indie film.
B007PKOKZY,Lyna,5,Very appealing story of a man and woman who meet serendipitously and are drawn to on another by their likeness.
B007PKOKZY,Lynn McBee,5,I really enjoyed the whole premise of this movie. I thought the actors did an excellent job. I loved the character development both of the main actors did with their characters. The story was well written and tight.
B007PKOKZY,mr. contrarian,3,Two smart attractive people are at a transitional point in their lives.  They each take dead end jobs at a zoo to keep busy and bring in a little cash and...whaddaya know: romance blossoms with a couple of standard movie roadblocks that almost keep it from happening.  Women will like this one.  Men will see every plot twist coming a mile away.
B007PKOKZY,Sarah,3,This is definitely a good and original film. The story has a nice message and the actors were all excellent in their roles.
B007PKOKZY,ShopGrl09,5,I enjoyed every minute of this film. Such great casting and beautiful performances. It is best movie I have seen this year.
B007PKOL62,Doug R. Troupe "drt568",4,Good acting for French films go.The movie moved along and kept you interested.Could have been filmed in more locations?D
B007PYEWZ8,Janet C. Walker,1,I watched this as a Prime customer for free.  It was worth about half of that.  Very similar to stepping in dogcrap.  Now I have to go bathe.
B007PYEWZ8,lagrandedame "fan forever",5,Why wait and pay more money at the theatre?  Another great Samuel L. Jackson flick!  Ends with a twist -- and a lingering question.
B007PYEWZ8,Lynn McBee,4,This movie kept my husband & I on edge through the whole thing. Lots of death and blood. Love the actors and they did a great job with the story.
B007PYEWZ8,Nick6684,5,Samuel Jackson is good and playing a bad guy!  This movie was worth the buy it before its in movies price of $9.99. This is a great suspense thriller that kept my attention from start to finish.  If you like Samuel Jackson then you will like this movie!
B007PYEXL6,Erica,5,It is one of the best performances ever captured on film. The depth of the ensemble cast is mind blowing.
B007PYF66W,Ex Brit "smj",5,This is yet another Brit TV show with real characters and great acting with a touch of humor thrown in.Lots of familiar faces in the cast including the lead actor Alan Davies who is always enjoyable.
B007PYFAJ0,dulcibell "dulcibell",2,OK series. Love Cieran Hinds though. He's excellent as usual. Maybe I was just in a strange mood when I watched this.
B007PYFAJ0,egf,5,Horrific murder detective case with good acting and plenty of twists and turns.  Not for the faint or young viewer
B007PYFAJ0,Faye P,3,I must have closed captions (as a hearing impaired person). I chose this program because the listing summary indicated that it was closed captioned. Enjoyed part 1 and then was very unhappy to discover part 2 is not captioned. Cannot understand why this situation exists. Better to have left off the CC indicator on part 1 and not fool us who are hard of hearing.
B007PYFAJ0,Jeremy Van Pelt,4,Interesting characters and a good mystery. The UK TV mysteries tend to run longer than our 45 minute police procedurals and can pack in more about the characters and provide more depth to the story. The female lead  shows intellect and skills at handling being the only woman detective in the room.
B007PYFAJ0,Loretta Mederos,5,This did not disappoint. Can't wait to watch more. I love having a female star in the major role. Good to watch anytime.
B007PYFAJ0,Sandra Acquistapace,4,I have long been a fan of British police dramas as well as the dry English wit (notwithstanding Monty Python & company).  The set period lends itself well to demonstrating the less than enthusiastic welcome to women in a male dominated profession.  Excellent acting by all.
B007PYFAP4,Amazon Customer,4,I gave it 4 stars because of the quality of the story. Acting and plot are very good and will keep you guessing.
B007PYFAP4,Amorette,5,I like this show very much.  It keeps my interest.  I don't get bored.  It is interesting to see a different setting than our American crime shows.
B007PYFAP4,egf,5,Well acted and written but this is a copy cat murder that is very graphic and not to be viewed by the young viewer.
B007PYFAP4,Five Yards,3,I watch primarily for the sight of Ciaran Hinds and find Kelly Reilly distracting (I like her better as Mrs. Watson). Somehow this plot did not come together for me.
B007PYFAP4,gpat65,5,Love this series. The young female detective is strong willed and smart. The show is exciting and fast moving and I really enjoy it.
B007PYFAP4,htmcs,5,Good stories . Good acting . I just  recently saw Kelly  Reilly in a tv series on American channel  Had no idea that she was British. Very good series . I would watch many more episodes if they come about.
B007PYFAP4,James F. MacLean,5,She carries the whole show. I still can't believe she is doctor Watson's wife in the Sherlock Holmes movies.If your a male and love eye candy then watch this show.
B007PYFAP4,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,Ensemble interaction is first rate.  Suspend imagination and just let the story unfold as crazy as it is and enjoyable at same time.  Well done by all involved!
B007PYFAP4,Karen Wilson,5,Clever intertwining with the real Black Dahlia case.  Again a really good series I would like to see more of.
B007PYFAP4,Lisa_Minneapolis,3,The concept of this show was great but the writing didn't measure up. I liked the cast but again the characters seemed very superficial. It almost seemed like the writers couldn't be bothered to do any heavy-lifting. It's too bad because it could have been a wonderful series.
B007PYFAP4,Mark Wolfe,5,I have to admit that I have watched each episode three times now. The plots are very interesting. I there is something about looking into Kelly's eyes.
B007PYFAP4,Micky,5,A. S. Season 2 - was even more surprising; more revelations; the story more twisted - a shocking conclusion - a bit &#34;sick&#34; - but I still watched.  You will too!
B007PYFAP4,Nancy Roblez,4,This is a really good detective show which is fun to watch because the main characters are interesting. Graphic at times when showing crime scenes.
B007PYFAP4,Robert Walker,5,One no more begins feeling sympathy for one of these characters and then you want them wasted. An interesting and nicely non-American approach where characters are a mix of qualities rather than simplistic cartoon. Ciaran Hinds is always interesting and the young detective working with him is equally engaging.
B007PYFAP4,Sally Goodin,5,I am a big fan of Lynda LaPlant's work and wish this series went longer.  Would like the series to run longer.
B007PYFAP4,Ssloane,5,Can't wait to see Season 4 over in the States.  Hoping that this excellent cast continues for many seasons to come.
B007PYFAP4,Toni5000,3,Not especially engaging and definitely only worth the 'free' episodes from Amazon Prime.  Ciaran Hind is always good - not much else
B007QJD6R2,Amazon Customer,4,A cute series about a little town in Ireland. It's a British idea of a situation comedy. I liked it.
B007QJD6R2,barbibobu,3,This season has a lost a lot of the charm and characters from the earlier seasons.  They just disappeared and we're not quite as fond of the new people and situations.
B007QJD6R2,Gram,3,This season was not as good as the other 5 seasons. I really enjoyed the other ones very much but was let downWith this one.
B007QJD6R2,shirley,3,I agree with other reviews I have read about season 6 in that it was certainly different from the first 5 . The new characters seemed to have made the difference. Maybe should have quite while the writers were ahead. Loved the first 5 seasons.
B007QJD6R2,Steve P,4,I really enjoyed the entire series of Ballykissangel. I was sad to see it end. Entertaining and funny with a little drama thrown in for good measure
B007QRER4K,Altecian,4,Sadly this is he last season of the series but it was great none the less. I would still have loved more but all things come to an end eventually. Also not a bad price either :).
B007QRER4K,Amazon Customer "DJC041003",5,This series and the charioteers will be missed. I have enjoyed seeing what would happen every week and the calamities that would befall Jack Carter. I am happy that he and Alison finally got together and would love to have a house like he lives in although I would want it solar power backup due to the electrical grid problems.....LOL...
B007QRER4K,Angela Anderson,5,I loved this show when it was on but missed some of the episodes. Now I can watch the last season while working out.
B007QRER4K,B. J. LARKIN "The Beej",5,What can I say about Eureka?  Colin Ferguson and cast gave this quirky series so much heart and charm....loved this show and I HATE Syfy for cancelling it for stupid wrestling shows.  If you have not watched this show...give it a try.  You'll love it.
B007QRER4K,Charles Van Cleef,4,this series is getting a little bit long in the tooth by season five but it is still one of the most endearing series that my family has watched. For the price&#8230; Definitely worth the entertainment value you receive. If you like the previous season she will like this.
B007QRER4K,James A. Moore "Jim",3,C'mon. Someone ran out of material. Timelines? Who gets back? Why don't they want to go back? What happens to the beings they replace?
B007QRER4K,Jeff SC,4,As this was the last season of the series I was expecting the writing to be a lower caliber than the rest of the seasons. it was not. I liked the way they wraped it up.
B007QRER4K,Kathleen Fuller "Kathleen7",5,We are so bummed like many others that this was the last season of the show. We all hope they will create a Season 6 and beyond!
B007QRER4K,Katycaboose "Katty",5,what a shame they discontinued such a unique show.  always looked forward to the next episode.
B007QRER4K,K. Thomas,5,Wish it was back.  Don't know why they always cancel the good shows. Get rid of all those reality shows and bring back real tv.Awesome show!
B007QRER4K,Linda C. "Linda C.",5,Season five meant the end of Eureka on television and the town and the characters will be missed. Thank goodness I have the entire series on DVDs. I look forward to watching the episodes and reliving the charm and chaos in this quaint little town.
B007QRER4K,old timer,5,Good clean prime time ready for all the family fun.  I love the characters and the crazy science.  I just wish they could have kept the show around for more seasons.
B007QRER4K,Pamela Medina,5,It was a dang shame they took this show off the air.  It was really well done.  I miss it a lot!!
B007QRER4K,pam,5,my husband and i have really enjoyed this series wish it hadn't have been ended and i rewatch all seasons as i can
B007QRER4K,P. Manley "book lover",5,I enjoyed this series.  Didn't really want it to end but all good things must.  Worth watching if you like comedy with a slight sy-fy twist.
B007QRER4K,putder53,5,THIS IS SAD TO ME. I ENJOYED GOING TO EUREKA. IS A GREAT WAY TO END THE SERIES. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS AS WELL. GOOD BYE EUREKA
B007QRER4K,readinglarge,5,The perfect ending for this zany series.wraps up every single character and five years of storyline in this last season
B007QRER4K,Ruby,4,This was a series with a different twist.  If you like syfi this will be fun to watch!  See it from the beginning!
B007QRER4K,Rugby,5,I love this entire series  - the primise as well as the characters. I am over 50 but love science so was into it although I see the show as better fit for teens. A positive and entertaining message.
B007QRER4K,splash "splashjam",5,Eureka is the perfect show for the entire family.My son and I love it and thanks to Amazon Prime we are able to watch the entire series from beginning to end as often as we'd like.Eureka is the #1 show Syfy has ever aired and it is an absolute shame they decided to cancel it. My son and I are still hoping Syfy comes to their senses and starts filling this great show again.
B007QRER4K,Steve Bystrak,5,Great show. Will miss it.
B007QRER4K,S. Warren,5,So want to cry.  Love the show from all the way from the first season.  Sadly it had to end.  Still great season.
B007QRER4K,TJD "Kara Thrace's Special Destiny",5,I wonder what awesome top secret project Holly and Doug have been recruited for. Lots of traveling... please tell me she is going to be a starship captain. A follow-up to the Astreaus mission? A spinoff perhaps? :D
B007QRJV0K,AMason,5,My boys still love their Avenger shows....so this one is great for car rides to our family's house and for quiet time.
B007QRJV0K,Amazon Customer,5,Loved season 1 and loved season 2 even more. I hope to see a season three very soon! Ant-Man! I need more Ant-Man in this!
B007QRJV0K,Gray,1,I love this series and am a big fan but.....Giant robots???  Seriously???  All the other episodes are outstanding but this one is pathetic.
B007QRJV0K,Jacqueline "ys diva",5,I love this show and am bitterly disappointed it was canceled before it really got going. The writers handed the twisting story lines expertly and made sure to give all the Avengers enough face time to make the viewers care about each one of them. This show has a really good Loki too which is very hard to do and currently only this show and the Avenger's movie have managed to pull off.This show is a must watch for kids and adults.
B007QRJV0K,MacGyver's "Swiss Army Knife",5,Fun to watch!  It shows how important a team like the Avengers would be.  Love the character interaction and the fight scences.  Good job marvel.  Lets get some more shows like this on.
B007QRJV0K,Michael S. Jessop "Generalist",4,As far as superhero action series go this isn't bad.  They stay fairly true to the characters and even parallel the actual comics books for the most part.  My kids enjoy this and the older X-men series.
B007QYRCX6,Amazon Customer "&#34;Insert snazzy catchphra...,5,This is another of those rare series I can put up for the kids with relatively little worry. The storyline is good enough to keep me entertained and the kids love it though they don't &#34;get&#34; it all yet.
B007QYRCX6,Brandon K Shatswell,4,I just started this season.  I'm only a couple of episodes in.  I do enjoy the show...(but it is important to remember that it's not quite Avatar!)
B007QYRCX6,Cami=) "Cami=)",4,It was a nice production and a good attempt at connecting the stories without making it a sequel.....i do feel they were rushed in the storyline to get it out there.....i dont know if they felt they were getting a second season..... I feel they would have developed the characters and storyline a lot more......
B007QYRCX6,E. Helms,5,My daughter and I enjoyed watching the &#34;Last Air Bender&#34; series togther and were excited to see this new spin-off. We watched all these together and enjoyed them just as well. This story line is more of an older teen style but was clean good vs evil adventures.
B007QYRCX6,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",3,This show is not bad and a decent follow up to The Avatar. They just don't have quite the same impact that the originals did. Not sure I like the timeline advance.
B007QYRCX6,Lydia Buitron,5,I never really liked Anime but the storyline of the avatar is very spiritual and moving. This second installment to the last Airbender isn't as good as the last Airbender but definitely noteworthy and worth watching I believe the writers did a great job making this show and I hope they continue to add to it.
B007QYRCX6,Michael Chen,5,I can't wait until season 2.  If you like the original avatar you would definitely like this one.  Characters are really developing.
B007QYRCX6,Rene',4,The Legend of Korra is an okay sequel to the Avatar.  It starts out a little slow but later episodes start to get better.  The animation is great and like the original Avatar the characters are written with depth if not sometimes a little too silly.  I hope the series continues to get better with time and became a true classic like its predessor.
B007QYRCX6,Theresa Lepiane "Theresa",2,I found myself waiting for Ang to show up to brighten my day.  The whole beauty and artistry of the original was downgraded in this.  It shows that the producers wanted to make a quick buck by tapping into the children's market.  The original Avatar was actually beautifully put together. This is a piece of crap and destroyed most of my feelings about the original characters.  Save your money
B007QYRCX6,Tina Van Eick,4,We loved the Air Bender series and was so glad to see you offer this.  We can't wait to see the subsequent seasons.
B007QYRCX6,Varian David,4,I really enjoyed the story and felt it was a little better than Avatar: last airbender. I like how they tied everything together from avatar to present day.
B007R9XAB8,Amazon Customer,5,These girls reallty do learn how to dance professionally. A shame the mothers behave like idiots.  Abby Lee does her job otherwise the girls would not be so good
B007R9XAB8,Cathy Dunican,4,I watched this because I really like the original Dance Moms with Abby Lee Miller.  This is about a dance studio taught by 2 guys and it is enjoyable.  I think the original Dance Moms is better but this show was with an interesting cast of characters in it.  If you like Dance Moms you will enjoy this show
B007RV6X2Y,Sandra L. Foster,4,This movie was pretty decent. I like most anything Samuel Jackson is in and this was no exception. Good action.
B007T05BSK,grace,5,excellent true life presentation of issues related to use of psychics for investigation.  well balanced and no hype. usual quality for ID
B007T05BSK,Granny123go,5,I found this fascinating.  It is amazing how they pick up on the facts of a case.  I think you will enoyed watcing it too.
B007T05BSK,Lynda Norton "Highland Enthusiast",4,Though physics are brought in to help the police in most cases they can't or don't solve the crime(s) and updates aren't given (thus what I have seen so far.) I think when putting together a series such as this with programs already product and shown that updates should be added after each program OR noted that the case is still cold.
B007TADRIG,Michael P. Mcintire,5,As usual csi ny grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the hour. Good starter for season with several twist which makes the audience become involved
B007TADRIG,MWOO,4,Characters are good but they could do a little more to make the characters moreinteresting.  Stories are well written.
B007UMJSZE,E. Magno,4,Endgame has interesting characters with challenging plots that provide for good drama and comedy. I would have enjoyed a second season if it wre available.
B007UMJSZE,M. Kennedy,4,Clever and funny with a flakey chess master who can solve mysteries without leaving the hotel in which he lives.  Found this program while searching for something that I could justify paying to see.
B007UMJSZE,Monica A. Sloan,5,I really enjoyed it and am now eager to watch further episodes.  Hope they are all as delightful.  What a character!
B007UMK3SA,Amazon Customer,4,It's not the fastest moving series but the good guy triumphs in the end. It's a worthwhile series to watch. The scenery on the west coast of Ireland is beautiful too.
B007UMK3SA,BargainHunter,5,Just as good as the first Season.  Really liked the characters and the plot was engaging. Worth watching more than once.
B007UMK3SA,Colleen,5,These keep getting better and better!  I hope they continue with a season 3!!  Better than most cable and pbs series currently available to watch!
B007UMK3SA,C. Perez "c. perez",5,The series was well thought  out and it takes place in Ireland. I coiuld actually understand most of the language. To bad the series is over. Lots of plots thru each episode. Worth a watch.
B007UMK3SA,Craig S. Werner "The Grumpy Old Squid",4,This is an interesting look at police life in a small village in Ireland.The problems of politics in a small community take their toll and it is amazing to see how much.
B007UMK3SA,Foster,4,Lesser known actors and a good sturdy plot give this stoical tale of Northern Ireland cop shop a nice different flavor compared to the unusual police formula show. The scenery alone is delightfully different and the dilemma faced by N. Irish Jack in facing corruption and incompetence and a forlorn love life is compelling and we'll worth a second look.
B007UMK3SA,Fred,4,A good detective/police stories of a very small Ireland country city. Good look at the Ireland cost-land and country side.
B007UMK3SA,G. Higley,3,Reasonably entertaining with decent acting and interesting story lines. Recommended for those who are into the genre as well as those with an interest in Ireland.
B007UMK3SA,John O. McMurren,5,Incredible photography-great scripts-both my wife & I love it! We can't wait for the next season to arrive so that we can gobble it up...
B007UMK3SA,Kathleen Caires,4,The Irish live up to their reputation as good story tellers.  This series gives a realistic slice of Ireland in the Galway area of western Ireland.
B007UMK3SA,KOBAM,5,Single-Handed Season 2 episodes were as exciting as season 1. They also stepped the complexity up and increased the number of intermingled story lines. The characters remain plausible and emotionally evocative. This is a great series for the scenery alone.
B007UMK3SA,Leah,4,STILL TRYING TO RAISE HIMSELF UP ABOVE HIS FATHER'S LOOSE WAYS. THE BONUS IS VISITING IRELAND COUNTRY SIDE. YOU MEET SOME LONG LOST RELATIVES.
B007UMK3SA,Lisa "boston's biggest baked bean",5,Great crime show with a twist in that it is based in Ireland and not the US or UK like so many are. The stories are good and not hokey like it could have turned out to be.  The scenery is pretty.  My only complaint is that the main character is really the only normal one. The rest are pretty lacking in ethics- even his mom turns out to be a little shady.
B007UMK3SA,lpearson,5,I loved this show throughout all the seasons.
B007UMK3SA,Max Mustang,4,Same story line. Interesting cultural shift and scenic locale. Seems the &#34;Murder Plot&#34; will never grow old. Yada Yada Yada....
B007UMK3SA,Palani,4,Not much I can say about this series except I enjoyed watching it. If you like BBC type of investigative who done its you'll most likely like this.
B007UMK3SA,Patricia J. Owen,5,I love this series!  My ancestors are from Ireland so I love the scenery & the dialect.  The storylines are great. Can't say enough good abt this series!
B007UMK3SA,sam,5,Love the premise of hometwon boy returning home.  It reminds me of an american soap opera but with an Irish accent.
B007UMK3SA,Southern belle "southern belle",5,Love the way the actors/actresses are &#34;everyday people.&#34;  They don't try to glam them up.  Hope they make more of this show.
B007UMK3SA,Thomas W. Flacke,3,This second season has a lot of holes in it but still enjoyable to watch. By holes I mean missing characters whose absence could be covered by a few lines of dialogue. I look forward to season 3 if there is one and I hope there is.
B007UMK3SA,Tom Stevenson,5,More like this please.  I do not understand why I need to post a certain number of words in order to review.  Seems silly
B007UMK3SA,Verna Metzger,4,The story lines are interesting and the characters have depth. The setting of Ireland is a nice change. Compelling stories
B007UMK3SA,Viv,5,From Ballykissangel's rolling hills of Ireland to the windy shore of Single-Handed I&#34;ve enjoyed this Season 2 story line of a serious Garda who strives to be honest. Many surprises in each episode. I do hope this continues into another season.
B007UMK3SA,W. Cleaveland,3,This short series is good and I would recommend it to a friend.  It gets a bit mundane in that he sleeps with every woman that comes into the series.
B007UXS5NY,Lilly D,1,I had a hard time trying to get into this story. Not something i wanted to spend time watching on.
B007UXS5NY,Lynn "Bashira",4,I like that the crimes are not solved after one episode like most American crime dramas. That makes the plot more realistic.
B007UXS5NY,P. Bates,4,This was a good series. A lot of suspense and good acting. I would watch more episodes if they were available.
B007UXS5NY,Toni5000,5,This series is wonderfully engaging - the characters are well done and keeps you guessing and the politics behind the scene are interesting
B007UXSDT0,Daphne,5,Great entertainment for teens and adults.it was great to be able to watch the series on prime on my kindle
B007UXSDT0,Dorothy,5,Upstairs Downstairs is excellent.  Every single show for 5 seasons was excellent.  Superb acting and story line.  I wish there was a season 6.  I will miss it so.
B007UXSDT0,Evelyn M. "new at this",5,I enjoyed the series and all of the characters in upstairs downstairs season 5. Now I'm getting ready for season 6. I like the way that the series winds down. Good entertainment and helps to understand those times somewhat.
B007UXSDT0,HFC,5,Season 5 has been excellent.  The series cast have all given excellent performances.  Would like to see more programs like this.
B007UXTC2M,Ethel K. Robinson,4,I love good crime drama with great scripting and plot content.  This met my standard very well indeed.  I hope it has more seasons to come!!
B007UXTC2M,Mark Wolfe,4,each episode was better than expected and went down different paths than expected. Very good writing and acting. Will watch again.
B007VQLRGW,David R. Criser,4,The jet fighter pilots over Korea were amazed to see the Russian built Mig introduced into battle for the first time.
B007VQLRGW,RayInLV,4,He spends hours watching military documentaries about air battles from every source I can find.  He got tired of the series he was watching and this is a perfect replacement.
B007VQLRGW,Steve P,4,Interesting and informative at the same time.  A definite watch for a military history buffs. Enjoyed all of the combat fighter match ups
B007WPLZAK,exwyzee8,5,I love love stories and this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's sad and real and will break your heart. The acting is amazing!!
B007WPLZAK,grand,2,I never thought the war segments would be more interesting than the love story.  Poor acting for the love story and so much dead pauses.
B007WPLZAK,Julie "juliedolls",3,The main character has the worst attitude concerning his circumstances that I have seen in a while. He was annoying.
B007WPLZAK,Kimberly Alexander,1,I just couldn't finish watching this one given the graphic portrayals of the sexual relationship between the two principal characters.  While the relationship was central to what story line I could find (and that in itself was a challenge) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways.  I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off!
B007WPLZAK,meg,5,Love and all the emotions in one movie that made you want more. A movie worth watching of all ages.
B007WPLZAK,NHB "show me",5,Have seen this twice and find it just as moving and interesting as I did the first time.  Beautifully played and mounted too. Doesn't get much better than this.
B007WPLZAK,toni gulotta,2,expected story to be much more real.  male main  actor always seem to be in a daze.  horrible was going on and he 's in dreamland.  I felt like shouting &#34;snap out of it&#34;  didn't enjoy movie at all.
B007WW7GH4,Mark Hall,5,Our family loves this show. We ordered the season so our daughters could watch it since they do not have cable at their homes.
B007Y36DVG,Carol,3,It could just be me.  I am not a fan of the documentary style films.  I thought the movie dragged a bit and the ending appeared rushed.
B007Y36DVG,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,I love scary movies and this one is another one to add to the to buy list. I'm starting to get out of them more gory junk and really enjoying movies that scare! I recommend this to anyone that likes the kind of paranormal activity type movies. Enjoy!
B007Y36DVG,Robert Wittenburg "hardbags dot com",5,you ...... will ........... love .......... this .................. item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........
B007Y36DVG,violet rose,5,i loved this movie....i felt they did a fantastic job with it...it felt real...it kept my interest...it was creepy & had some good "jump in my seat" moments....if u liked paranormal activity (1st one) then u will really like this movie........great effects too....and great ending....cant wait to watch it again....and worth the 9.99.......a must see for anyone who likes supernatural movies.........
B007YNXQXO,Jacob Crampton,5,I love all the Survivor series. It isn't my favorite season but it is still worth watching. You should check it out.
B007YNXQXO,nancy,5,I can never get enough of this show.my only wish is that Amazon offered all of the seasons.
B007YQ5D8M,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,American Experience series was very educational and entertaining.  We highly recommend it!  We looked forward to watching it each night.
B007YQ5D8M,Kansas,5,This is one of the best shows on PBS and if you like to know about the history of some of the variety events you will love this show.
B007YQ5D8M,norma jean kringer,5,Wish I learned history this way since film footage shows a little more truth than an opinioned author.  Never gets dull
B007YZ29U8,h3liflyer,5,A great show with nice visuals...I am a science teacher and I even have learned a thing or two from it.
B007YZ29U8,Jamie Hensley,3,This season is filled with too much speculation and leaves one feeling less than satisfied by asking more questions than it cares to answer.
B007YZ29U8,lne,5,It is something I don't mind him watching even though it is probably way too advanced for him. I am interested too and find myself watching more than I imagined I would when we put it on.
B007YZ29U8,Mike Hunt,5,Truely educational and entertainment tv.  I watch these over and over mind blowing stuff. Space is our future if we have a future.
B007YZ29U8,moptop64,5,This show is so cool. Great for all ages. You can watch an episode over and over and get more out of it.
B007YZ29U8,Palani,5,Really enjoyed Universe. I have always been a space nut. This is really fun to watch. I've seen it on TV and just have to watch it again and again.
B007YZ29U8,THE G,4,This program makes you think about how our world began and what may lie ahead for us. Great for students of all ages.
B007YZ29U8,Wendy Johnson "Imcyked",4,Brilliant simulations and great footage from NASA make this series a must watch for astrophysics fans or folks that like science presented in an entertaining way.
B007YZ29U8,Yvonne Michel,5,I learned a great deal because this series presents the most current research into this fascinating topic. I'm watching the whole series.
B007ZF1JW6,Arthur Gooch,4,alot of people are into this show and e-mail back and forth-this and the green lantern shows are two of the best on t.v
B007ZF1JW6,Efrain Casul Jr,3,I was enjoying the suspense and the drama of the series but disappointed it stopped at episode 7.  What a cliffhanger 7 episodes for the season 2.  I wanted more.
B007ZF1JW6,Michael Chen,4,The second season shows the kids all grown up.  It is a little confusing especially when you see 3 batmans or 3 flashes.  Was kinda hard to tell who was who from the first season.
B007ZF1JW6,Seven,5,This was a great show!! The writing was great. Keeps you guessing as well as good development of each of the heroes.Action was great but not senseless. The fights were well done and placed in their proper form. This show won multiple Emmy awards... and they cancelled it because of low toy sales!!! Are you kidding me? Bring them back!!
B007ZF1JW6,victor,5,Hands down the most enjoyable and exciting cartoon series Ive ever watched.. Great stories.. Great characters... Cant wait to watch the rest of it!!
B007ZU23GC,C E Matthews,5,We love to watch this show. It is like the adult version of America's Funniest Home Videos. Better host &  funnier videos!
B007ZU23GC,Dave,4,I know that title seems a little dumb but it is only because my I.Q. points definitely take a hit while watching this show.  Sorry but I like it any way.  Seems a little devious to be cheerful about other peoples misfortunes.  Sorry but it is funny sometimes
B0080CK0O6,daedrya,5,These shows are much better than the standard U.S. crime shows.....they're grittier and more interesting. Less &#34;glam&#34; and formula driven. Highly recommend it..
B0080CK0O6,Lynn "Bashira",4,I love British dramas and crime tv. Please make more of them available for free video streaming for prime members.
B0080CK0O6,Roberta,5,she tries to be so hard and yet her soft inner self seems to come out without being sappy.  But if I were her I would slap some of the male colleagues around a bit.
B0080CK0O6,The Gigi,4,She lives the life of a man personally and professionally...the morals of an alley cat probably helps her fend off the male prejudices of the police command/upper-echelon who know she is good in her job...most of the time...but still don't like her.
B0080CK0O6,Tom Stevenson,5,fabulous....British TV and Movies seem to carry a better story line than shows done here in the US and that is a sad thing.  But I did love The Commander
B0080CKV72,Rick,3,A very low budget movie but quite good. The violence is over the top and way beyond anything I have ever seen. Similar to the zombie movies but with severely mentally ill patients. The ending can be a copy of Shutter Island or maybe not.
B0081FD7BA,David "Black Widow 2014",5,Stan Lee is the man. I love all and every character he has created but spider-man is my ultimate favorite. this is a documentary of stan the man lee. one of comics most awesome and famous creators. this is a great documentary and everyone who is a fan of comics or superheroes should see this movie. this is a awesome film. I don't think the world would be the same if he did not come along. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0081HVXG4,A. M. Bonito,4,I wasn't sure if I would like this movie but I did. I wish other seasons were available but they weren't. I would recommend it to others.
B0081HVXG4,Barbara E. Blanco,4,I love Jane Austen stories and the period movie series. Loved the actors and slight change in retelling this classic story
B0081HVXG4,Sue,4,This version of Mansfield Park focused much more on the heroine and her final happy ending with marriage to the younger son. I have seen other versions which brought out some of the other subconflicts between the father and the eldest son who clash over the slavery issue on his father's overseas plantation. The schemes of the unfaithful married cousin to meet with her handsome lover are downplayed in this version as well. This version seems to gloss over the flaws and shortcomings of  many of the characters in the real version of Mansfield Park to make it more acceptable for television audiences. Enjoyable enough to watch.
B0081HVXG4,V Johnson,3,There are 2 adaptations of Mansfield Park on Amazon Prime.  I watched both of them.  The other I found more to my liking.  This one seemed a bit shallow.
B0082CXI34,AK,5,Fun show to watch. Definitely worth buying if you watch it alot on Cartoon Network. Own all seasons as of right now!
B0082CXI34,Paul Aguirre,5,I love adventure time its a good cartoon show best one cartoon has had on in a long time I would recommend it
B0082CXI34,SilverJade451,5,I love this series!  This season gives us a little more about the world of Ooo and lots more fun.
B0082JW05O,Brenda D. Nelson,1,I've been looking for a good standup comedian that knows how to deliver real laughs without making me cringe or change the channel for fear that someone (my grand kids) would see me laugh at crude humor.
B0082JW05O,Eric Nathanson,1,I made it through about 15 minutes before giving up.  It just wasn't first rate material.  It seems that a lot of stuff on Amazon Prime could be described this way.
B0082JW05O,night player,4,Good show and a little different. Just long enough to keep your interest but not so long as to get boring.
B0082JW05O,NormaJean James,4,I love this show because it showcases new comics.  I usually watch this series just before turning my set off each night.
B0083IJGBU,Amazon Customer,4,So many remakes of P and P and this is my favorite. Was the catalyst to Colin Firths career. Love the scenery and pomp and circumstance.
B0083IJGBU,Araley,5,My roommates and I used to take an entire weekend to watch the entire mini-series. Very well done and perhaps my favorite Ms Bennett and Mr Darcy since Garson and Olivier.
B0083IJGBU,Book Lover "CYN",5,I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. To me Colin Firth is Mr Darcy and I could watch it every week.
B0083IJGBU,B's Mom,5,I'm not sure I know anyone who has not seen this movie or some version.  Who doesn't love Mr. Darcy.
B0083IJGBU,Carolyn D. Smith,5,This is one of the best period pieces I have seen.  Colin Firth kills it in his porttrayal of Mr Darcy.  It it touching and heart wrenching.  Loved it.
B0083IJGBU,CTM,5,Great series
B0083IJGBU,curlygirrl,5,I just re-watched this series for the umpteenth time. What is it that draws me back time and time again? #1 would have to be Colin Firth's performance. Has any actor ever harnessed the &#34;brooding&#34; factor better than he has as Mr. Darcy? #2 would have to be the sizzling chemistry between Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  Each of their eyes convey so many emotions that it makes my head spin.  I believe Jane Austen would be exceedingly pleased with this adaptation of her work.  I don't understand why they keep making newer versions of the book when it is virtually impossible to match the quality of this series.
B0083IJGBU,Debra A. Ward,5,What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said?  It is absolutely the best rendition of this story ever filmed.  It is my go-to movie if I don't know what else to watch.  And it seems new and fresh every time.
B0083IJGBU,djr311,5,This presentation is very very good and the setting and costuming are excellent.  I am only at part 4 but I love every minute.  I have always loved Colin Firth and the younger version of him is even better.I have finished the series and it is my #1 favorite version.  Great presentation!
B0083IJGBU,Edward Vanzo,5,I have seen four different productions of Jane Austens' story.  They are based on the same book but are portrayed quite differently.They each have their own portrayal of the characters and are all worth watching.  This version is one of my favorites.
B0083IJGBU,Elizabeth A Gonzalez,5,One of my all time favorite programs.  This one... there are other productions.  Just a wonderful story and  wonderfully acted.
B0083IJGBU,inspectorudy,5,I have read the book and seen every version of it and this is the best!
B0083IJGBU,James R. Turner,4,Better than the movie by far. Not sure why it is called season 1 - is there to be a follow-on?
B0083IJGBU,Laura,5,It does a very good job telling the story- Austen style.  It did a good job staying true to the original written story.
B0083IJGBU,Nukumach,5,I chose this rating because it's my favorite movie of all time. I love it because I always imagine myself in their time. I think it's the most romantic movie ever.
B0083IJGBU,Nuttya22,5,I give this mini series five stars.  The acting was as wonderful as the story.  It does a great job of capturing the time period.  I love Mr. Darcy!!!
B0083IJGBU,SusieQ "Carwalker",5,This is the closest &#34;series&#34; I've seen to the book.The role of Fitzwilliam Darcy is definitely betterdone by Colin Firth. He is Darcy.
B0083IJGBU,T. L. Smith,5,I enjoyed watching Pride & Prejudice. It was very nicely done. I would highly recommend this program to everyone.
B0083ZLR24,jess,5,this is hands down the coolest cartoon i have ever seen in all my 31 yrs. I even keep up with it every week. chracters and concept rock my socks. if there were ever a post apocalyptic world id hope it was like ooo.
B0083ZLR24,Paul Aguirre,5,Best cartoon series cartoon network has had on in a long time I recommend it to anyone who likes cartoons its cool I love it
B008494L22,Erica,5,I love it and always loved the father Brown mysteries and it's a great made for TV version of it !
B0084RZPPQ,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",2,this movie was boring and felt so fake and staged to me.  Did not enjoy it but kept waiting to see if it got better
B0084RZPPQ,crosscountryman,1,God please tell these film school pimps to quit making these awful clones.  It seems there is no end in sight of the film school rejects efforts at selling a product whose time has come and gone years and years ago!  Don't make any more!
B0084RZPPQ,Ms KAM,1,The film makers really should stop watching reality TV and actually go to film school to learn how to make movies.
B0084YC47G,louis "unapologetic fan of good tv",5,i miss kelly and jill a bit and wasnt sure if i liked the new folks. (other than carole who i loved on sight and love more with each episode "im definitly coming on the trip now!")aviva turns out to be wacky but wonderful and her dad is the best new character ever. we ALL have embarrassing and inconvenient relatives who are beloved and mortifying at the same time. He deserves his own show. He is unfiltered and outlandish and the best part is her reaction to him. I cannot wait to see him interact with luann (who seems more comfortable this season) and ramona (who i actually like this season and who loves to revert to her religion when all else fails)Aviva and family (including her mother in law- herself a character) could easily have their own show. all in all very cool. oh- and of course sonja is her fantastic self. still love her.
B0084YC47G,Nicole Crew "Trauma Queen",5,These woman are the reason I CHOOSE to have no female friends! All the bickering and arguing is entertaining to watch though. This city and jersey are the BEST real housewives! Thank you Bravo!
B0085SOJ1A,Chuck St. Louis "The Saint",1,Missed the Grade and slid off the road. The writers must have been snowed in because is no longer worth watching.
B0085SOJ1A,juan,5,This is a good series.  I admire these drivers that risk their life and work under harsh conditions to bring food to the table of their family.
B0085SOJ1A,TJK,3,Much of the same. Somewhat interesting but the producers can only go so far in creating any interest after the 5 seasons before this one.
B008620ZTA,C. Latham "zcarbo",5,The 3rd season of Rookie Blue was a great season. Each subsequent season is better than the last really love this series.
B008620ZTA,Jessica L Meyer,5,Hooray for a show with more than one female story line. It is great to see women playing dynamic characters.
B008620ZTA,Julianne Knutson,5,This was by far entertaining.I loved that you kept up with all the main character's love lifes and what they had to deal with outside of the police station. Wonder what will happen in the next season!
B008620ZTA,TERRIE MIXER,5,This show has turned out to be one of my favorites. Very realistic to life. EMOTIONALLY CHARGED. CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT SEASON.
B008620ZTA,THOMPSON,5,WAITING FOR THE NEXT SEASON. I NOW HAVE A WAY TO VIEW IT WITH MY KINDLE FIRE. WHEN IS THE NEXT SEASON ?
B008620ZTA,Woman in a Strange Land,5,Season 3 can seem confusing if this is the first season you're watching. The back stories on the characters are well developed and make watching the season 1 & 2 well worth the time. The actors seem to have developed their character's drives and complexities and thus seem real in season 3. I like that each of the main characters is given a chance to show who they are and why they do and react to the same situations that fit their character's personality. There is still the group doing police proceedures as seen from each characters perspective. Some have said it's like the show Grey's Anatomy but I see it more like the Law and Order shows. I enjoy seeing how the characters actions drive the stories each week. The writers have been able to keep season 3 fresh and hopefully this will continue. I appreciate the lack of soap opera cliffhangers that other shows use to keep the viewer "hooked". The acting and writing is solid and it's a good show.
B0086213XW,R. Turnbull "art lover",1,Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments. I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content. Otherwise this film was a waste of time.
B008621DSM,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,Just watched it on netflix and adding to my buy list! I love movies with some actual scary stuff in it. This also has a great storyline. I was impressed with what they did with this. Just goes to show you don't have to spend the big bucks to make something good. I'm so tired of the same old gore junk and lately I'm finding some really good scary movies thank goodness! If your looking for something that is creepy and actually has a good plot then this is your movie. Check it out on Netflix or Redbox! Like I said I'm buying it!
B008621DSM,Michael "beergut",3,Decent thriller - a couple of scenes didn't make sense (why didn't the ghost just kill the psycho brother?) But all in all- it's worth a watch. It's &#34; silence of the lambs&#34; spooky with a supernatural twist. Notthe best movie- but not the worst either.
B008621DSM,Rating My Best Pick,4,You want be disappointed I was really shock to see how great the movie turned out to be. It's worth the money good entertainment.
B008621DSM,Ron Baker,4,When two sisters come home to deal with their mothers death a horrible secret is unveiled that their mother hid. Not your typical horror story. Has one wicked ending.
B008621DSM,SomeoneWife,4,It was an okay movie.  It wasn't as scary as people claim it out to be.  I didn't like the way that it ended.  But overall I guess I would recommend.
B008621DSM,Tamara J. Christian,1,It had a few jumpy moments but we never figured what the pact was and who made it. It just wasn't that good. The acting was sub par especially for who the actors were.
B0086T6RH2,Chris Winchester "mikeystoyz",5,I really like this show.  I am not learning anything new here but just like to see what these people are up to.  Some of them seem to be a little extreme - hence doomsday - but it is fun to watch.  If you like anything about prepping or even if you dont you will like this stuff.  Some of it does leave you scratching your head going really?  The stories follow people that are prepping for an extinction level event and what they are doing to prepare for it if you are at all curious.
B0086T6RH2,DemonessOfDeathValley,3,I don't have really a beef with this show. Other than these people are really doing this. I do think that being prepared is important. But to go to this extent is a little extreme in my eyes. and it's kind of frightening some of the things that these people are doing. the amount of firearms shown in the homes is disturbing. And if you tend to be a worrier or you're easily rattled. this show isn't for you.
B0086T706Y,aztnge,5,I really really like this show & especially Callie Thorn ~ she is a very sexy lady & I hope the show continues for a long long time.
B0086T706Y,Big John MacK,5,Great a really great show well thought up professional filed the writing and acting is superb. I think this may well become a classic if it doesn't move to far off base.
B0086T706Y,Cooper,5,1. I love TK's new awareness.2. I would have loved to see Nico and Dani get together. Sad Nico is leaving
B0086T706Y,M. Campbell,5,Season 2 packed as much of a punch as season one with a little more spice! A great show to watch!
B0086T706Y,M. Kennedy,5,Interesting turn of affairs and happy that K.T. became aware of growing up and older.  Son had an expensive car which I would have taken away from him and grounded him.
B0086T706Y,T. Brady "Tom",3,I title this in this way because the episode fluctuates back and forth.  Characters have their strong points and weak ones in this episode.  Although I like the series as a whole I thought this episode had its drawbacks but the viewer is the judge and not a tv critic.  The series itself though is very good I recommend anyone to stick with it.
B00870YQLE,DeDe "DeDe",5,Fabulous show great story line wonderful characters and acting.  Would have been awful to see it cancelled. Glad Sony saw the light and went to work to "make it work" for all concerned & mostly for all the fans out here. Would have really missed it- and there is that doozie of a cliffhanger- cant wait to see where they take that. Thanks Lifetime! Thanks Sony!
B00870YQLE,diamonds,5,i have enjoyed all 4 seasons of the series.  it is a funny drama.  i enjoy all the charters on the show
B00870YQLE,liesel strong,5,i love drop dead diva because it it is serious but still fun and funny. i like the fact that she's an adult but yet this total girly girl.
B00870YQLE,Lynn McBee,5,I really enjoyed this season of &#34;Drop Dead Diva&#34;.  I love the characters but do miss the previous angel. Characters are growing and developing well. Hate that Kim Kardashian is in the show. Disgusting person and lousy actor.
B00870YQLE,Sandra Seebers "Avid Reader",4,Great show. Just wish the star didn't keep gaining weight.She is very talented and I really want her and Owen to get married!
B00870YQLE,Tori "Effortless",5,The premise of this show isn't brand new - but it's well executed. The characters are very likable and you can't help but want things to work out for all. It's a fun light hearted show!
B0087BJXM0,dennis sohn,5,This show is really funny and I can't wait to watch more of these episodes. The story lines are so catchy.
B0087BJXM0,jks1980,5,It's a funny show runs along the lines if it's always sunny in Philadelphia not nearly as clever but definitely entertaining
B0087BJXM0,Ryan Mullin,5,This is one of the great &#34;stoner&#34; show of all time. Sit down with a fatty and enjoy all the laughs. Enjoy!
B0087YNHNI,Alice,3,The show is created with limited video footage and there is too much repetition of scenes to fill in time.  That is the only negative.  It is a good show revealing the day to day struggles of surviving in the mountains.
B0087YNHNI,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",5,I am new to Mountain Men but after watching a catch-up marathon of season 2. I of course had to go back to season 1 on Amazon Prime. I am really impressed. I especially love watching these mountain men create something from various natural things and with primitive tools.  I think my favorite character is Eustace in North Carolina. He's amazing!
B0087YNHNI,Constant Reader,5,This show offers an in depth look at what it takes to be self sustainable. It isn't an easy road for sure.
B0087YNHNI,Darlene,4,Hard to imagine living this way but it is intersting to see how they not only survive but enjoy it.
B0087YNHNI,Francisco Loaiza,5,True self reliance is shown. I have a new respect for people who love this way.  A good show that is more than mere entertainment.
B0087YNHNI,Harlan Kamm,3,This is really slow paced show but it is interesting.  These people have developed systems to make it on their own which I find rather amazing.
B0087YNHNI,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",5,So interesting to see how self sufficient these people can be. Reminds us how hard life was for our ancestors.
B0087YNHNI,jaxxnjas,4,Not action packed but a pleasant glimpse into what these men have to do daily to live. It's not easy.
B0087YNHNI,Judith Pritchard,4,This show makes wish I actually had cable.  Between mountain men and swamp people that would be about the only reason I would pay for television.
B0087YNHNI,JULIE DONALD,5,I really liked this show...Beautiful scenery. It makes me want to visit these states! Please hurry and Add another season!!!!
B0087YNHNI,Kungfujackrabbit,4,Mountain men covers three interesting areas with pretty interesting men living off the land. One critique I had was the show would switch too frequently between the locations. That really made it seem abrupt and a little hard to watch. But it covers adventurous areas youll enjoy seeing. Good show I'll keep watching.
B0087YNHNI,Lawrence Rivett Jr. "Elvis Mercury",5,I really like this show about individuals living off the land.  Helps remind us that are basic struggle in life is really daily survival and not acquisitions and social standing.
B0087YNHNI,Micelle Parker,5,Love the views shown in the show. It is interesting to see how different they live than most of us.
B0087YNHNI,New2This,5,This a a well document series which is both informative and entertaining.The challenges faced in the wild are both eye-opening and frightful.Very well done.
B0087YNHNI,P. K. Nolen,4,This one is fun to watch. People are very interesting and their life is so interesting. Will keep watching it.
B0087YNHNI,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,Great show ...It tells me there are still people out there that still live off the land & shows me that civilized  life in the city is way better than living off the land....(NO INTERNET!!!)
B0087YNHNI,Sadie,3,Really? Couldn't they have found more capable &#34;men&#34; for this series? The only one who isn't a complete &#34;mountain moron&#34; is the dude in MT. The other 2 shouldn't even be on.
B0087YNHNI,shopalot,3,Shows is good but they really need to quit the re capping ... Half of the shows is repeating what already happened 5 minutes earlier. Also hard to believe any of the drama ... Almost seems fabricates
B0087YNHNI,tin man,5,I have watched this on network TV and liked it. I wanted to see if there was an episode that I had missed and found I had missed a few. This shows how soft we have it at home.
B0087YNHNI,Whale,5,Great show!! Would like to see season two on prime. Love the scenery of each place. Can't wait for more
B0087YQVY0,MFJLabs,4,2012PG: Every once in a great while we meet someone who makes us want to "sit taller in the saddle". If you're one of those people you'll enjoy this story of an old writer who's lost his reason for living then finds it in the dream of another (won't spoil the story) while searching for it in the bottom of a bottle. It's a cold heart that can't find warmth in a story about real people with real feelings. Redemption of self can take many forms the favorite of which may be to "never stop looking for what's not there". I hope you enjoy this beautifully written and wonderfully played gem as much as I did. MFJLabs 4x
B0087YQVY0,Pamela,5,I loved this family movie.. A feel good happy movie...
B0088LTU54,Big John MacK,4,The fun twists that were part of the first two series are not as present in this series still very good but not great
B0088LTU54,Blue Moose,3,The plots have a lot of twists and turns in them to keep you guessing until the end. An entertaining series that so far hasn't gotten into the stale trouble of other similar programs.
B0088LTU54,Carol J. Wooldridge,5,i've followed this series from the first season and collected each one. it is a good show and i hope it continues.
B0088LTU54,Carolyn Skinner08,4,enjoy the scenery beaches etc. like the people that are in the show and the stories are believable and interesting
B0088LTU54,charlie t. hodges,5,this is one of the greatest shows you have on prime t.v. I love the plots and jims way of solving crimes is entertaining.
B0088LTU54,CO GIRL,5,I loved this show.  Have watched all episodes but am now stymied because I can't continue watching without paying for the final season  I would prime yourself for the fact that the series is going to be over for you at the end of season 3 unless you're willing to pay for the last season
B0088LTU54,DEEZEE,3,Slowly but surely the soap opera infiltrated the show and less and less mystery. I hope season 4 is not all washed up.
B0088LTU54,Douglas Deicke,3,The first and second seasons of The Glades were very good but the third season was OK because the storylines were a little bit boring.
B0088LTU54,Jeanne Lorance,5,Wish I could find season four on DVD rather than digital.  Really bummed that A&E cancelled this and keeps all those other goofy 'reality' shows
B0088LTU54,jim,4,it 's interesting to see the cases and character growth the season and hopefully more seasons to come thanks you
B0088LTU54,Joanne,5,I think that the show has a great mix of characters.  I love Jim's eye rolls and sarcasm along with the chemistry with Callie.  I just hope that the writers don't mess with that.  Sanchez and Daniel are a good combination.I heard that it is continued for another season.  That's great!
B0088LTU54,jose viveros,3,Same fun show but this season lost a little something.Not as fun as the last season but still fun to watch.
B0088LTU54,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,he is just plain awesome.  he doesn't even have to say anything.  just stand there.  this show should go forever.
B0088LTU54,libbylab,5,I look forward to each episode.  The main plot is usually quite complicated and the side plot with the romantic stuff is pretty well done. I enjoy it all. I also enjoyed seasons 1 and 2.
B0088LTU54,M. Naidas,5,Good series so far
B0088LTU54,movie lover "jean",5,I buy the series but have not had a chance to view them yet while they are still being shown on TV
B0088LTU54,P. K. Nolen,5,This one is also fun to watch. The people in it are very enjoyable and funny. Can't wait til more episodes come out. Hurry and get them and lets get started on them.
B0088LTU54,Rene L. Hogan "R.L.Hogan",5,Season is light hearted with multiple story lines. Sometimes Mr Longworth can stretch the realities of the law. Show does stretch Fla geography by trying to make every town less than 1/2 hr apart but this show is about entertainment.
B0088LTU54,Rene Welch,5,I love this show!I am a Amazon Prime member and I am willing topay the new price.  Just wish you would put on more seasons forprime members.
B0088LTU54,Richard "Dickie",3,The show is fine but again ten episodes? Not much of a season. And no subtitles for the hearing impaired.
B0088LTU54,R. McCuistian,5,We've followed The Glades ever since it started and it seems like Jim is a long lost friend - can't wait to see more...
B0088LTU54,Thea "Urbana",5,I truly wish there were more episodes of this series it was very good and I enjoyed the uniqueness of the character. It definitely left me wanting more
B0088OUTLA,Kelly,5,Why is this show gone forever? I was so looking forward to next season. Leah was my favorite! I'd rather them cancel the OG mob wives.
B0088OUTLA,Nicole Crew "Trauma Queen",5,What song is played in the beginning? I look on YouTube and I guess the tv version has a different version then the one on Amazon instant video. HELP!
B0088OUTLA,Terrie,4,These women take the word crazy to a whole new level. Very entertaining.I think they must live for drama. lol
B008947J8U,AlwaysWatching,5,Really good story...good acting...GREAT show! I do hope this show gets many more seasons! Not enough good shows on TV nowadays.
B008947J8U,BDI "Book reviewer",5,Longmire's character has the same gritty approach to a sheriff's role as the Western I grew up watching in the '50's.  Long suffering but dedicated to bringing justice to his county.
B008947J8U,D C Lathrop "DC in AZ",5,Saw this with no real expectations and have been very happy with this series.  Every episode has been interesting with continual character development
B008947J8U,Deborah R. Painchaud "De Pa",5,Totally enjoyed. I like the slow evolution of the back story ...the characters have depth and believability. The storylines were interesting and the setting great.
B008947J8U,Diane K. Wilson,5,Really enjoyed this and am looking forward to seeing where they take it in season 2. I love the setting and cinematography. There'sa sort of &#34;cleanliness&#34; and clarity about it that really grabbed me.
B008947J8U,Douglas Deicke,5,Longmire is an awesome show because it has an interseting cast and Sheriff Longmire always knows how to solve crimes an catch th bad guys.
B008947J8U,Nicholas M. Zallas "Greek Scholar",4,This was an enjoyable series.  I like the character and thought the stories were interesting. My only thought was the shows moved along slowly.
B008947J8U,O. Vaughn "Movie Fan",5,Walt Longmire is a &#34;Man's Man&#34; and does things his way. I love this character driven show and all the characters are GREAT!
B008947J8U,pegeen,5,there is a good balance for much drama and they do not disappoint .  I found I like this show more than I may have intended when I purchased it.  I'm a fan now.
B008947J8U,SandyLW,5,A very interesting concept done by the 2nd actor we're aware of with the name Robert Taylor.  We loved the first actor with this name & this one does not disappoint.
B008947J8U,Shadhawk,5,My wife and I have a hard time waiting for the next episode to come out. The character development is written nicely into the story of each episode.
B008947J8U,Susan Harris,5,Great series which I wish was one for a longer duration per season.  I want to read the books because the series is so intriguing. Cant wait to buy the next season.
B008947J8U,Vikki,5,I absolutely LOVE the whole Longmire series!  Excellent entertainment...characters you want to know and can identify with.  Keep them coming!
B00899EO9M,A. Drefahl,5,It's all about Barry! He makes the show worth watching. He adds color to every episode. Dave is a dufus.
B00899EO9M,Alice,4,Nice for Family and you also can learn from this. I rated a four due to unappropriate language..other than that ok
B00899EO9M,bruce,4,Still entertaining after all the time it's been on television. I missed quite a few episodes and this is a good way to catch up.
B00899EO9M,Cappnormal,5,I simply love this show and it's characters. It's way too bad that Hester dropped out of the show.  He added quite a bit to the entertainment value.
B00899EO9M,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,I like this show. It's another reality based show that makes me cheer for some of the bidders and boo the others. It also shows that your can either find trash or cash in unwanted storage lockers.
B00899EO9M,ed schreiber,2,just did not hold my interest for very long.it is more of selling stuff than storage issues involved for most part
B00899EO9M,G. L. Oneal,5,I love this show. It's just great entertainment. It's one of those few shows that you can just kick back and feel entertained. But I also love all the cool facts and stuff that you learnwhen they are having pieces appraised.I like the newer shows that have more people there bidding.it just adds more excitement!
B00899EO9M,jeff,5,Still good even though they say it faked now i still like it just to see what weird stuff they put in there or find
B00899EO9M,Joyce A Campbell,5,I'm always waiting to find out what treasures will be in those lockers.  Some great surprises and the bidders grow on you.
B00899EO9M,Lurch,4,If you know this is all staged and just get a kick out of seeing old things and the thrill of thinking what if.  This is the show for you.  It is fun and the staging hokey.  But hey that is what entertainment is all about.  Jump in and give it a try it is worth a few min just to let your brain relax
B00899EO9M,M. Webster "None",2,Completely unreal.  I can't see anyone leaving some of the things they come up with.  No one leaves rare coins and valuable artwork.
B00899EO9M,Queenwilliams,4,Fun but sometimes predicable.  I'm uncertain how &#34;unscripted&#34; the show is. I mostly watch to see Barry Weiss in action.
B00899EO9M,RND,5,Barry is a hoot!  He really makes the show.  The other characters blend the total scheme of this comedy show
B00899EO9M,RustyShoemaker,5,Because I love the show along with the characters Brandy being sexy and smart and Jerod the witty one of course Caintleave My man Barry out with all his poker faces and Darrel &brandon the bad asses they are I could do without Dave being the ass he is
B00899EO9M,Sam,3,Storage wars has been fun and interesting to watch but I'm afraid that by season 3 it's starting to show it's age. More time is spent on trying to cast the characters into something entertaining and less on what they find in the storage units.
B00899EO9M,Victor1896 "movie addict",3,Just more of the same.  It would be interesting for them to introduce some new players.  The rumor has it that the good stuff is planted - I wonder if that is true.
B00899EOIS,Agnieszka Koszowska "MovieLOVER",5,I'm hooked on PLL (as on many other shows as a show junkie;pp) And I love Amazon for having most of the new ones out there so I can watch them on the go (KINDLE FIRE)Pretty Little Liars season 3 is as good as 1&2. The Amazon quality is great as well:)
B00899EOIS,Amber R Burkhart,5,I love this tv series. :D It's great especially when your prego and on bed rest. Helped pass the time.
B00899EOIS,cutenerd,4,I will not buy this on amazon instant because they are charging too much. I mean I cant even download this unless I dishout more money for a freaking kindle fire! It is stupid to pay so much for a show I could lose if amazon goes under. Sorry but amazon you lost my purchase. I bought one episode and just couldnt bring myself to buy the rest of the season.
B00899EOIS,D. R. Roberts,5,Great delivery time on this item! Could not wait to get it tarted to watch where i left off from last season.Plot thickens and new villains are finally revealed!! I love the characters and the new developments!
B00899EOIS,Francis Tuifao,5,I have been watching this show on Netflix from the First Season through the Second Season. I am so &#34;hook&#34; up that I had to watch the episodes from the Third Season. I really enjoyed this show.
B00899EOIS,gitaday "Gitaday",4,How can you reach the end of last season and think the next could hold any new surprises?  It does.
B00899EOIS,john ward,5,The Four pretty ladies are once again fight and turning to discover who the person ---A---is. There's more suspence more nerve racking stories and something new at every turn.
B00899EOIS,Julie Murphy,5,Pretty Little Liars is so addictive and has been from the first show.  This season has revealed much and also brought up many more questions.  We are looking forward to the new Spinoff starting in January.
B00899EOIS,Kathy Miller,5,I missed the tv series as I worked in the evenings.  I purchased it as it was good and exciting.
B00899EOIS,Lezli A. Polm,4,I had my doubts at first but this show sucks you in and keeps you watching. Good mystery/drama series. I have to say it is now a favorite!
B00899EOIS,Scmeemaw "Scmeemaw",5,I ordered this series because I would keep forgetting what night it was on TV or which channel it came on and I would miss it. So I watch them on the weekends instead. I am a older woman and thought this might be to young and I would not be interested in it but I am hooked on Pretty Little Liars. It has so many twists and turns in it. Just when you think you have it figured out something different changes your mind. Love it!!!!
B00899EOIS,Vaness1233,5,This show is addicting! Can't wait for each new episode! Very suspenseful and good acting by whole cast. Love it
B00899EOIS,whatnot,5,I have watched the show from the start and all the actors and plot is great. Looking forward to watching the new series only after it is free for Primetime members.
B0089A6BLU,Amazon Customer,5,One of the best television series out there.  action pack from beginning to end and simply a great delight for those who love paranormal were wolf books and movies.
B0089A6BLU,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",5,One of the great shows to watch.  Acting is tops to me and the action is always there each episode.  Am hooked to the point not watching just one or 2 shows a day is good enough I get lost watching on line and can watch several hours at night.  I would recommend this for older teens not younger ones as it does have some graphic bloody parts.
B0089A6BLU,Chinabug "chinabug",5,Every time I think they cannot top an episode-they do! The cast is wonderful and well chosen for each part they play.  Makes me look forward to Mondays.
B0089A6BLU,patricia,4,I enjoyed watching this series but upset that I can't get the lastseason without paying. Oh well there other things to watch.
B0089A6BLU,Paula,4,The actors are interesting and the action is good. He makes werewolves look good. Waiting for more shows. Backgrounds are beautiful.
B0089JDMHW,amrbilly,5,i never get tired of watching this show. it getting better with story line from beginning to beauiful relationship brother...cant wait til 5th season
B0089JDMHW,B. Merrill,5,I love this show this was a really great episode. Usa has a real winner with this show. I wish I could see this series every week all year long.
B0089JDMHW,Ellen H. Center,5,a very funny and very touching show.  I like all the characters on this series Bravo!!!!!!  It is very heart warming to see them solve medical problems using items at hand
B0089JDMHW,Kindle Customer "Amazon Devotee",4,After four seasons I'm still engaged and look forward to each episode. I like the &#34;evolution of Evan&#34; through the years from days of poor judgment to seasoned partner in the business. Hank is still interesting and it's been good that fewer episodes rely on a highly creative and unlikely medical solution to a rare disorder he happens to come across. I'm sure there are thousands left to explore but how plausible is it that he knows so much and happens to use it all in the Hamptons? I'm curious to see where season 5 takes us after (spoiler alert) the loss of Boris.
B0089JDMHW,Michael S. Jessop "Generalist",4,I catch every third or fourth episode and I like it.  I always like a good medical mystery tho' so... take that for what it is worth.  There is always some sort of drama going on as they go about their business.
B0089JDMHW,Shane A Reber,5,If you haven't been watching this show by now then you're crazy. It's like Macgyver got a Medical Degree and sold out to the filthy rich yet he's Robin Hood too treating patients on call  at home work any where any time HankMed will be there in a Flash and treat you like your Family. Then there's hanks Whackey yet well meaning brother Even who always means well but sometimes ends up causing more trouble than was there to begin with. His Physicians Assistant is a brilliant girl that is Hanks right hand woman and constantly putting Evan in his place. Just check it out cause it's good
B0089U12GO,Cub,3,Chewing gum for the eyes.  I'm not a fan of reality shows but the novelty of one in the bayou was worth a look.  There is a little humor and some interesting cases but not enough to have drawn me in a second season.
B0089U12GO,ed schreiber,5,The series flows coherently. Characters are appealing.Hope to have it continue on prime soon.Thanks for showing us this season.
B0089U12GO,Edward H. Bell,5,This is a family friendly program that I find to be the best &#34;Cop&#34; show produced. It downplays violence and displays the 'Protect and Serve' side of law enforcement. Very compelling cast that smoothly entices you into every episode - 5 stars at least.
B0089U12GO,hidden,5,The show is great.  I love the paranormal aspect with the legends of the rougarou.  It's also a scary place with all the dark voodoo.
B0089U12GO,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",4,We love the genre of police vs felons! We always search for this type program but not all are that good. This one was surprisingly well done.
B0089U12GO,J. M. Cavalieri "mrcavalieri",4,One of those shows you can watch with the kids without worrying about someone dropping an F-bomb or something.  It doesn't necessary paint Cajun folks in the best light.  It has some very humorous moments to offset any intensity.
B0089U12GO,Mystery Shopper,3,It'll do better than watching reruns for the 5th time but I wasn't overly impressed with it.  Could have been much better.
B0089U12GO,nickphd,4,You can tell that a lot of the scenes are setup. But a very entertaining show. I miss living in Louisiana!
B0089U12GO,P. K. Nolen,5,We have really enjoyed watching this program. All the things people think of to do is so funny and sometimes very intense.
B0089U12GO,Ran,5,I love how they explain what folks might be thinking or why they do what they're doing. I think it's a good show for any age or race.
B0089U12GO,S. CONRAD,5,Cajun justice is a great TV show. I love that southern action. down to earth real life people.you'll love it too.
B0089U12GO,Susan Crow,1,I only watched two episode of this series.  It isn't a story type of show but just a lot of scattered things happening.  Someone may enjoy the shows but I would personally not recommend it to anyone.
B0089U12GO,Wisconsin Girl,4,Always interested in the &#34;Cajun&#34; genre' and was not disappointed with this show.  The characters (employees) of this department were each &#34;featured&#34; rather nicely on different shows where they encounter different problems but found the antics / teasing between the officers an entertaining way to end each episode.Keep up the good work.
B008BF99F8,Amazon Customer,5,What a great series!  It picks up where it left off years ago.  The Ewings of the 2013.. spectacular!  I highly recommend this series to all the original Dallas fans
B008BF99F8,chinagirl "ncchinagirl",4,JR is as ruthless as ever. Would have liked more Sue Ellen and JR scenes but it is a good show and season. Even Cliff is back. JR's son John Ross is great and hot and sexy too. If you're a Dallas fan your collection is not complete w/o it.
B008BF99F8,Chris NYC,5,I did not know what to expect with this new edition of Dallas but I'm sure glad I watched. The whole season was excellent and the writers did a good job of delivering the excitement and suspense known to follow the Ewings. I definitely recommend the show's whole seasons to new and existing Dallas fans.
B008BF99F8,Laura,5,Can't wait to start watching this first season. When it started I was not allowed to watch but my brother and I would listen to it and now I can actually watch it.
B008BF99F8,louis "unapologetic fan of good tv",5,This episode was everything a long time fan could hope for. i hope everybody buys this so they continue to make more. seriously. jr is as good as ever.
B008BF99F8,Nat,5,This was the best remake ever. And Larry Hagman was still JR. The young family members are following there parents foot steps all the way. Looking forward to Season 2.
B008BF99F8,Prefl96,5,JR is as rotten as ever. The cast and plot are great! Too bad Larry Hagman passed away. Can't wait for next season!
B008BF99F8,Ruth Grady,5,Great show...hoping it continues.  Loved the old show as well.  Too bad JR is gone but love how he keeps his legacy alive.
B008BQ8VOC,Amazon Customer,5,Absolutely love this show. Great story lines that will keep you hooked. I love law (I even have a paralegal degree) and every once in awhile they sneak in a legal maneuver even I don't see coming. Can't wait for season 3.
B008BQ8VOC,Amazon Customer,4,Constantly evolving plot.  Very interesting charactors. You really don't know how each person will change during the season. Can be watched each week with a different plot but the actors are changing over time.
B008BQ8VOC,Amazon Customer,5,This series is a real surprise.  The characters are that - real!  My husband and I sit and guess where the storyline is going - we are always pleasantly surprised!
B008BQ8VOC,amrbilly,5,this show kept me falling off the chair every time...i never knew lawyer are smart but this show is much smarter lawyer just kidding!!!
B008BQ8VOC,awilderirishrose,5,Season Two MUCH better than Season One.  For those watching 1st season; be patient - better CONTINUING plots in the 2nd.
B008BQ8VOC,Barbara J. Mcdermott,5,Always so much going on. Never a dull moment. Punch lines galore This series is funny as hell and yet has some serious moments.
B008BQ8VOC,Beverly Johnson,5,I'm addicted! Binge watched yesterday to catch up and am now in Season 4.
B008BQ8VOC,B. Lyn,5,This is a fun series with lots of laughs & fun characters.  Not to be taken seriously - just enjoyed!
B008BQ8VOC,Bob,5,GREAT CHARACTERS. GREAT ACTION. GREAT SURPRISES. T he interplay between the legal eagles and their aides combine to make  the action fast paced and totally unpredictable.
B008BQ8VOC,Brandonia,5,I wanted to watch season 3 so I started and began watching season 1 with Prime and then just kept rolling right into season 2. WHAT. A. SHOW. I was hooked from the first episode.
B008BQ8VOC,Brian "batfan",5,Awesome show.  The actors are great and we enjoy every episode.  The banter between the two mains is fun.  Bing watching can be difficult because now we want the next season and it's not on Prime.
B008BQ8VOC,Brian,5,The strong characters and sharp dialogue continue into the second season. A great watch once again. Still love the fasting.
B008BQ8VOC,Brian,5,This season teaches that there is no such thing as perfect loyalty and perfect honesty when competing to be the best at practicing Law.
B008BQ8VOC,Brittany Thompson,5,This show has something for everyone and I also love how this show does not hinge on you seeing the previous week's show although we never miss it!!
B008BQ8VOC,Buddyjay,5,An amazing show. I watch this on Amazon Prime; I gave up on cable a few years ago but this show almost makes me want to go back to it....NOT!
B008BQ8VOC,David,5,First few episodes take time to get used to but if you give it a chance it soon becomes addictive - it's as good as the Goodwife if you like attorney shows that have content an som humor. The key players are extremely good
B008BQ8VOC,Dg,5,After season 1 I just couldn't stop watching season 2. What I love about this season is how we get to see Harvey develop a closer relationship with mike and donna. how mike keeps developing into a tough lawyer but trying to maintain a kind heart while doing it. There are some backdrops but don't wanna ruin it and the ending....it was a hate and love moment for me. Hope this helps! Enjoy!
B008BQ8VOC,D. P. Lance,3,Same cast same plots it still works.  This is not a procedure show but about real people doing their job and letting us see all the warts.
B008BQ8VOC,eaglegrafix,3,Fun series that is far from realistic. This is fantasy law in practice. Yet still worth while just for the fun of it.
B008BQ8VOC,E. Lillian Creveling,2,Not really my feeling of entertainment. Too much arguing and bad attitudes plus I don't like the rude language. Crap
B008BQ8VOC,Elizabeth Ansley,5,love this series and Gabriel Macht is great eye candy Good plots and interesting characters lots of fun to watch
B008BQ8VOC,ElizJamie,5,Suits is a great show. Just enough drama. Each week keeps you watching up till the end sneaks up and you have to wait till next week. One of the best features I find in Suits is that -- it's funny! The humor keeps it from getting too heavy. It's just a clever and fun show to watch.
B008BQ8VOC,Ellen H. Center,5,This series about a very very &#34;white shoes&#34; law firm is filled with dramatic episodes and it is very well acted.
B008BQ8VOC,Emily H. Leonard "catsmother",4,The characters develop nicely in this second season. Look for subtle  hints of ethnicity. What do you suppose the writers are implying.?
B008BQ8VOC,EMSDAVE,5,&#34;Your hard work really shined through.  It's obvious you've been at this a long time.&#34;David ColoradoI will audition
B008BQ8VOC,Glenda Birdow,5,This show is intelligent with brilliance performance by all cast and guest actors.  I hope the show in renewed for many years.
B008BQ8VOC,Guy in a chair "grottogreeno",5,Good acting and smart screenplay with a few exceptions.  It's a 4 star show not 5 as I rested by accident but its still good
B008BQ8VOC,Guy Portland Oregon "Guy Portland Oregon",4,the writing and the story line is very good all the actors do an excellent job and it is quite refreshing
B008BQ8VOC,InBedReading,5,Couldn't stop watching. Love every character. Dialogue is fantastic. Can't wait for the next season. Keep up the banter. Thumbs up!
B008BQ8VOC,Jacklyn Ostler,5,We had heard suits was a good show but didn't start watching until recently.It's entertaining and fun to watch! I highly recommend it!
B008BQ8VOC,James Gaan "PaiGowMaster",5,I love this show about a very smart guy with a photographic memory who can read any book and understand it.  Then he becomes a lawyer in a big firm.  Pretty good con game here. Or lawyers are all liers and can't be trusted.....
B008BQ8VOC,Jason McNees,5,I wish season 3 was available.  this series just keeps getting better and better...but season 3 is not on prime..YET
B008BQ8VOC,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",5,I liked all of the actors portraying their different characters in the seasons.  Good acting really.  I was pleased with the series ending.
B008BQ8VOC,John Crites,5,Loved the first season as much as the second!
B008BQ8VOC,John C Woods,5,Interesting and funny with a bit of thoughtfulness. It seems like a good reflection on human behavior while staying lite and funny
B008BQ8VOC,John R,5,A fast action and at times a quite funny show! But when is PRIME going to let me see season three? The writing is superb as is the acting.
B008BQ8VOC,Jorge Gomez,4,My wife and I enjoyed this season very much. All the characters are interesting and the plot is well developed. Quite fast paced.
B008BQ8VOC,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,the best program on tv.  sex is around every corner and it sure raises the level of my bp.  i would recommend this program to everyone.  wish it was on every day..  gabriel is above and beyond and should be voted sexiest man in 1914.  the writers are extremely talented.  all of the actors are above and beyond for their parts they are playing.  i will buy every dvd of suits that comes out.
B008BQ8VOC,Karen Robinson,5,THIS SHOW KEEP ME GLUED TO THE TELEVISION ALL WEEK LONG. I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO SEE WHO WOULD COME OUT ON TOP. INTERESTING TAKE ON LAWYERS AND THE LAW. LOVE IT. PLEASE DON'T KEEP ME WAITING TO LONG FOR THE NEXT SEASON.
B008BQ8VOC,K. Hopkins "K Hopkins",5,I am totally addicted to this show.  So disappointed that Season 3 is not Prime :/But it's a great show.
B008BQ8VOC,Linda,5,Really good entertainment.  Thoroughly enjoyable viewing.  Love all the characters - even Louis who acts like such a  mad rat is likable (at rare moments &#128513;).
B008BQ8VOC,Lynn,5,I gave Suits Season 2 five stars because it's just a great show! I love this season better than season 1 and season 1 was very good.I recommend this show to anyone who loves a good laugh and anyone who loves drama.
B008BQ8VOC,Mam,5,From Season one we have been enjoying this show.  &#34; If you like Mad Men then you will like SUITS&#34;
B008BQ8VOC,Michael Duffy,5,What an interesting series...filmed in toronto and pretending to be nyc.  only the natives recognize local sights and buildings.  writing is excellent and acting is great.  gabriel macht is a loveable douchebag well paid lawyer.  he grows on you and his new side kick slash apprentice steals the show!
B008BQ8VOC,Michael Sullivan,5,Didn't think I wanted to watch another lawyer show. But I watched a couple of episodes and got hooked right away. Love the cast and the story lines. Surprisingly good show. Highly recommend.
B008BQ8VOC,N. Foley,5,Something endearing about the characters in this show. We look forward to each episode and hope this series goes on for many more seasons.
B008BQ8VOC,Patricia Appelquist,5,Oh and Gabriel Macht is good eye candy...I do watch for fashions even though I could never slip into some of the outfits
B008BQ8VOC,Phyllis DeSio,5,This was an awesome second season can't wait to see Season three this season kept your interested right to the end of the season. A must see..
B008BQ8VOC,pops95b,5,I love this show but I wish they would get back to it being mostly funny and less drama. I would strongly recommend it!
B008BQ8VOC,Popular1,5,Simple and sweet. Love the recap and especially want Donna back. She is a big part besides Harvey needs his sidekick.
B008BQ8VOC,Queen of Everything "Flur-de-lis",5,I have binge watched this show and am now on Season 3...wish there were more for me to watch. Great plots and interactions between all the players!! A MUST SEE
B008BQ8VOC,Raymond J. Brunner,5,I love watching this show. It is always with a twist to keep you thinking. I hate that I am at the end of the free season.
B008BQ8VOC,Ray Shiva,5,Really enjoyed the show. This season the plot gets a lot more intense. Never a dull moment. Cant wait to watch the next season.
B008BQ8VOC,Reggie,5,The second season is a lot better than the first!  Lewis is great.  Love that man!  I have to put 4 more words for this to qualify as a review. Otherwise Amazon will keep sending me a reminder to review things.
B008BQ8VOC,Sandra Seebers "Avid Reader",5,I'm hooked and can't wait for season three! Those two have to get back to being friends! Harvey must forgive Mike.
B008BQ8VOC,SandyLW,5,The only bad thing about this season is we watched it immediately & now we have to wait a year or more for the next season.Come on season 3!!!
B008BQ8VOC,Shannon Thomas,5,It's a modern telling of my fair lady. You pick someone no one would expect and you turn them into the belle of the ball. Or in Mike and Harvey's case the intern everyone want to be. Harvey never fails to charm a client and if charm doesn't work. Enter Mike who can get Harvey information he maybe shouldn't have.
B008BQ8VOC,Spencer Nassau,5,A great season that showed you a lot about both main characters and was extremely fulfilling in every episode througout.
B008BQ8VOC,Stephanie L. Hall,5,Can't get enough of this show! Just enough drama with some slices of comedy thrown in...makes for the perfect thing to watch to unwind after a day at the office.
B008BQ8VOC,Suzi,5,Can't wait until this show resumes!  It is smartly written and very clever!  My favorite character is Donna and her relationship (whatever that may be) with Harvey!
B008BQ8VOC,Teresa P.,5,Liked the first season but the second is even better. Gets more into the characters pass and how everything came to be. Love how these characters are evolving and growing. Can't wait for season three.
B008BQ8VOC,thomas marcelain,5,My wife had me watch this with her and i thought i would hate it. But i got hooked after one show. Awesome show.
B008BQ8VOC,TKD Fan,5,Lots of twists and turns.  Plus it's lite and funny at times.  Keeps you wanting more and guessing what's next!
B008BQ8VOC,Toni Eco,5,The characters on Suits are absolutely fantastic! The chemistry between Harvey and Mike has definitely matured but the writers put enough humor into the script that it doesn't hinder their relationship.
B008BQ8VOC,Tumbleweed,3,The second season is not as good as the first. The plots have some minor flaws in it. But it is good entertainment.
B008BQ8VOC,Vico96,5,I started watching Suits at the end of Season 2 on USA and got hooked immediately!  With Season 3 starting I needed and wanted to know everything on the show so bought both Season 1 & 2 and stayed up late for 2 weeks watching them....so awesome!!! Patrick J. Adams is adorable!!  He's so witty and his expressions make me laugh!! I highly recommend Suits to everyone...it rates right up there with White Collar in my book...USA shows are the best!!
B008BQ8VOC,Whocares,5,My husband and I love this show and this was a particularly great season.  We like that this is a Lawyer show without the usual blood and gore that accompany that type of show.
B008BQG3RE,Adam Rutledge,5,Awesome series. Steven Spielberg had his hand in it. He went deep. Deep and hard. Cant wait for the next season.
B008BQG3RE,Amazon Customer,5,I really enjoyed this si fi season and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys si fi as well. thanks
B008BQG3RE,Amazon Customer,5,This is one of the best series on TV and I hope it continues to get better and better and not become boring as so many others have
B008BQG3RE,barb dellesky,5,Very exciting...just what a sci fi fan wants!!!  I want to cheer for the main characters each time I view Falling Skies.
B008BQG3RE,Belinda Roman,5,The thing about watching Sci Fi on Prime is that you can follow the stories and engage without the hassle of commercials.  The story for Falling Skies was good for season two BUT let's home season three doesn't fall from the sky as well and end up a disaster of cliches.
B008BQG3RE,Bonnie Chinnick,5,Great action= adventure drama.  Love Noah Wiley and all the other supporting staff.  I would highly recommend it for all.
B008BQG3RE,bubblesinsd,4,This show has bits of previous alien invasion hits throughout. A steady progression of the plot keeps it from getting stale or hokey.
B008BQG3RE,Chris Schoenrock,5,Falling skies is a great mixture of sci fi and human drama. You care about the characters. Which makes this show and the walking dead excellent.
B008BQG3RE,Crystal M. "CM",5,Once you get past the 1st season the second season gets really good. A little more action and but a little less fighting to me.
B008BQG3RE,CT Crawford,3,I like that humanity must work together and give up their differences to conquer the bad ETs but quite honestly I would like to see the good ETs and what they have to say about humanity.
B008BQG3RE,David B Pyl,5,For a review on this season the review placed on Season 3 should be read. This series is truly amazing and mind grabbing. I can't wait for the next episode each season.
B008BQG3RE,David Linder,5,Wasn't sure where they could go with the series after the first season but man that was great...bring on season 3!!
B008BQG3RE,David Swayne,4,I find the writing to be engaging and exciting. I prefer stories that are a bit messy such as in real life. They tend not to button issues up nice and neat
B008BQG3RE,Dawny,5,Noah Wyle definitely landed himself a steady paycheck when he signed on for this show! He rocked In ER and has certainly rocked even more in Falling Skies! I can't wait for Season 3!!
B008BQG3RE,Dean W. Wood,5,This is a great SciFi end of world series. The acting is topnotch the characters are realistic. The CG and makeup is excellent. I can not wait for Season 3
B008BQG3RE,Debra D. Thiele,5,Start watching with season one to keep up with the story lines and follow up with second season to learn more of what is happening in the war to save mankind willing to protect the children as well as children taking up the fight as well to protect themselves and mankind.
B008BQG3RE,Derek Lowe "twerking the jalopy",5,Great story it's is sort of twisted from the normal Alien show and has a story that is aimed for that... Even non geek/tech scifi fans can get into it because of that. It s based in a post apocalyptic war earth where we lost the war. and focuses mainly on the rebel aspect of tryinng to take the earth back a fun show worth the watch.
B008BQG3RE,Devan Shane,5,I think the second season of falling skies is more intense than it's 1st season.. more action more drama.. cannot wait until the third installment is out on blu ray..
B008BQG3RE,Devora,5,I was kinda not interested then watched at a friends. Came home and before I knew it season one had been watched. I am hooked!!!
B008BQG3RE,DGator,5,If you like Sci-fi then you will love the second season of Falling Skies. Awesome show great acting good story.
B008BQG3RE,Diane M. Peterson,5,Thoroughly enjoyed this action drama as did my family.  We would like to see more sci-fi like this.  Would recommend.
B008BQG3RE,Differently Driven "Anime Lover",5,This political siren of imagination belies the depths of sincerity of what your enemies and your allies can be trusted to show the truth. First the take over without warning relates to what happened with our countries recent take over by the left. The lies of the right are the allies that say they are here to help but only in order to help themselves regardless what your desires are. A perfect story to help the youth of today understand how politics work and how alliances can't always be trusted and are only worth the effort to a certain point.
B008BQG3RE,D. Moore "Dano",5,One great fun TV show. Hope it is one for Years to come. I see it has SDH for the hard of hearing like season one did. One thing. I got it at Target for a buck less + tax. The shipping here a Amazon is getting to be very slow. And they put tax on things now. For a buck less  I can have it in my hand now. And doing so more and more. On something's Amazon is well worth it.  But if I can get it at Target/China Mart for a few bucks more are less I do....But this is a great fun TV show...
B008BQG3RE,Dolores Taylor,5,Every episode was exciting. I couldn't wait to get to the next one. Don't know how I missed it when it first was on TV.
B008BQG3RE,EMSDAVE,2,Slow movie with predictable outcomes. This could have been a winner!!!???  but I found myself bored at times.... GOODLUCKDave
B008BQG3RE,Greg,5,Each episode is worth watching and keeps the story going.  The last show leading to season three makes you want more.  Good drama with enough sci-fi.
B008BQG3RE,Harry,5,I was watching the previews for season 3 of this show. I'd never seen any episodes but the previews really caught my attention. I wanted to see the previous 2 seasons so I checked Amazon Prime. They had them for free so I watched them to catch up. It's a great show.
B008BQG3RE,Ingie,4,I feel upon this show when scanning the tv channels. I watched one episode and liked it but needed to watch from the beginning. I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon Prime.
B008BQG3RE,irabby,4,Season one was sort of hack but with season two it moves toward a more complicated and interesting story. Looking forward to seeing seasons three and how this story matures
B008BQG3RE,Jacob "RavenLoc",5,Professor Tom Madison has been brought before one of the leaders of the alien invasion and discovers Karen one of his troops under his command as its speaker.

B008BQG3RE,Jacry1990,5,Just love this show and the thought and concept behind it.  You hav e to really wonder since we all truly know we are not the only living creatures in the massive universe.
B008BQG3RE,Jaffacree,5,A great show with constant twists. Acting is good special effects are good story telling is amazing. As a scifi show you may expect certain things but the story and the character development is great. A true dramatic action filled show
B008BQG3RE,Jaimison,5,very well done. the cgi was excellent. story paced well. cannot wait for the next season to begin this coming june.
B008BQG3RE,Jerome Donarski,3,This series was okay but it seemed to lumber along like the monster robots that clunked and clanked their way across the screen in every episode.
B008BQG3RE,JH,4,Fun scifi drama with alien shooting.  I like Noah more in this than some other Library related mini-series. two words
B008BQG3RE,kbertch,5,This series just keeps getting better.  The characters are evolving and every show keeps me guessing as to what the aliens really want.
B008BQG3RE,Kelley Kuhlman "paperglyphs",4,Classic TV Sci-fi with alien overtones and a mad max apocalyptic theme. I like it. The characters are lovable or hateable depending on whomever it is. I rate movies or tv series on whether I would buy them or not. I would not buy this but I cant wait for the 3rd season to get to the streaming stage.
B008BQG3RE,Kenneth E Robinson,4,Falling Skies is a well written show that keeps you coming back each week. Kind of soap opera meets science fiction.
B008BQG3RE,Larry Baker,5,Awsome best science fiction since Stargate SG1!Acting is very good!Always like science fiction!Would recommend to anyone.Larry Baker
B008BQG3RE,Lewis Fulkerson "CowboyTech",3,Better than I expected but not good enough to hold my attention past one show. The plots for each show seem too predictable.
B008BQG3RE,lremick,5,I loved the series and the packaging was great! I only purchase series I have seen and liked. If any one asks for  my imput I would recommend this  series. Lookling forward to season three
B008BQG3RE,LT,4,I enjoy the turns the story has taken and I really hope next season won't turn into a poor scifi experience that just focuses on how many different aliens can be brought into the mix.
B008BQG3RE,magicboo2u,5,Gets you hooked-watched all of it and then lo and behold season 3 Amazon prime wants money for it! Sorry I watched it!
B008BQG3RE,Manuel De La Paz,5,Enjoyable story.  Action to satisfy the junkie.  Surprisingly good television .  The special effects at times seem a little cgi but the storyline makes one forget.
B008BQG3RE,Martin Allain,4,very much enjoyed the individuals and the moving dynamic of the aliens relationship with the humans. Understanding human relationships and need for each other.
B008BQG3RE,Mary Jaeger "Mary",5,Falling Skies is a great show with a lot of special effects too!  We are on the edge of our seats every episode we watch.
B008BQG3RE,MsMouse "MsMouse",5,Great acting and the story line is very good. I would recommended this series to anyone who likes alien movies
B008BQG3RE,M S SELIGMAN "pistolera",3,As good as the first season.  Holds your attention.  Great special effects.  Can't wait to see Season 3 when free.
B008BQG3RE,mvlver,5,One of the best TV made series. War of the world has been one of my favorite Si-Fi movies so this got me right off. I has just enough special effects great acting and great plot. I am watching  season 2 for a second time getting ready foe season 3's start.
B008BQG3RE,Nancy Mayton,5,good action movie for the entire Family. No Zombies but still as good can not wait to watch more epasodes.
B008BQG3RE,Otis H. McNutt "Hyrule's Savior",4,Tom is having a hard time adjusting to life back with The 2nd Mass. He is afraid of what he might do as parts of his time with The Aliens are missing. Afraid of what he might do he begs to be tied up while the 2nd Mass moves.But when a Skitter and Mech attack threatens the group he steps up to fight. Pope seeing a chance to rid the group of a threat blows a bridge with Tom still on it.In the aftermath Hal attacks Pope looking for blood until Tom emerges from the river unscathed.
B008BQG3RE,Patricia Appelquist,4,Somehow very long winded in this whole thing while I get the dynamics its just not that good anymore and I will have to see Season 3 if I really wanna keep up
B008BQG3RE,Rachelle S.,5,I'm so hooked on every episode of Falling Skies and I just finished all the Season and I wish that there was more!  Very good story line and lots of action and great acting.
B008BQG3RE,Rainyj,5,I started watching on t.v. & it is just my kind of show. Not having cable or satellite service any longer...I am able to watch on here. Catching up and will watch all that is offered.
B008BQG3RE,Raymond Coade,5,Great story line and continuity from episode to episode.  Falling skies should be around for many more seasons.  Have been a fan of Noah Wyle since his ER days and the Libranian episodes.
B008BQG3RE,rgoodi,3,Good old alien invasion idea done with an original spin I've never seen or thought of. Seeing something with twists and turns makes it that much more enjoyable.
B008BQG3RE,Robert Lange,5,Alot of fun and very engaging to watch. Noah Wylie is the perfect lead and he makes you forget he's the guy from ER. I own it and i've watched it several times.
B008BQG3RE,Ronald L. Montes "Ron The Tech",5,I can not stop watching this series.  PRIME has paid for itself already.  Almost through witht the second series.  This series is so suspenseful.  I recommend this series.
B008BQG3RE,ROY,5,I was so happy to get both 1st and 2nd season of Falling Skies.  Yes the 2nd season was better than the 1st in that the team has found a way to defeat the aliens.  Now I want to get the 3nd season as soon as it is published..
B008BQG3RE,R. Roberts,5,Falling Skies Season 2 at Amazon is as good as the first season and carries on in the same story.  The acting was excellent for those of us who enjoy the sci-fi drama action adventure series.  I say in my humble opinion that the show is well worth the watch.
B008BQG3RE,Sally Dinovo "TV & Movie Junkie",5,Watched this when it was on standard prime time TV. Always wondered what happened to it and waited for it to come back. I guess it went to cable which I don't have. So glad the story continued to a second season. Haven't finished watching it yet so don't know if this is the end. What a great alien movie. I like all movies of this type. Most are stupid but this one has a great &#34;family&#34; story behind it. It's really more about that than the focus being on the aliens themselves. I still wish Hollywood would stop making aliens that look like bugs and robots though. Noah Wylie is great as are the kids and other cast members. Acting against a green screen can be difficult but they do a good job. Yay once again to Steven Spielberg.
B008BQG3RE,sewready,4,Very good series. Always liked Noah Wyle but also has a great cast of supporting stars. Exciting action with interesting aliens.
B008BQG3RE,Shaun R. Moll,5,This is a wonderful series with lots of action! TNT has a winner with this show. I always enjoy watching it!
B008BQG3RE,Shelly Alit,5,Good story. Plenty of action. Family ties.  Not draggy. New look for aliens .different from the norm. Good for syfi lovers
B008BQG3RE,Sherry A. Mccall,4,there is another show that seems a lot like this show that has already been out there . it had a space ship like a aircraft carrier.
B008BQG3RE,S. Lasher,4,Long time science fiction fan and this isa good show. Noah Wyle does a great job. Not as good as the Battle Star Galactica remake but better than most.
B008BQG3RE,SusieQ "Carwalker",5,I started watching from listening to a lady he said she liked &#34;Falling Skies&#34;.The characters are well defined and you care about what's going on.The aliens depicted in this series are not all bad. I truly like this.I gave it 5 stars because I loved it.
B008BQG3RE,Tim O'Brien,5,A+  - excellent sf story.  Good characterization and relatonships.  Good story that keeps getting more and more involved.  I liked it.
B008BQG3RE,Tori Stegle,5,THIS SHOW IS THE BEST!  Easily one of my favorite shows on TV right now.  The cast is stunning and the story is perfect!  I love all the twists and turns.  Season 3 is off to an amazing start as well!  I highly recommend this to anyone!
B008BQG3RE,Toti,5,This is one of the best shows on now. Great human interest stories mixed with sci-fi. It is a must-see!
B008BQG3RE,Value Shopper Pensacola,4,I thought this was a very well written sci fi series.  I don't normally watch sci fy but this one kept my interest.
B008BQG3RE,Vic Graninger,5,I just love this series - I cannot get enough of it - thank you Steven Spielberg very much for this wonderful series.
B008BQG3RE,Victoria R. Brown,4,Lost track of the show.  What small amount of the show I watched was pretty good.I need to look at this on Netflix for free.
B008BQG3RE,Wendell Clendennen "Stretch",5,Love the way this series draws you deeper into the world of the characters and stays fresh by always adding new elements and surprises.
B008BQG3RE,w.ri,5,Loved season 2.  I want more and I want it right now.  I don't want to wait.  It''s that good.
B008CS6WJK,AK,5,Probably my favorite season due to some of the episodes in this season that I felt like touched based more on certain characters past. Overall I love all of the seasons cause this show is great.
B008CS6WJK,Arthur Gooch,5,the show you just have to let go and have fun---hope it stays fresh--so jump in and have a blast
B008CS6WJK,CJ Sitko,5,Lumpy Space Princess and her memoirs. Ice King and missing princess body parts. Marceline and the Nightosphere. BMO goes film noir. And creepy Lemongrab sleep peeps. You must meet these characters and laugh.
B008CS6WJK,Paul Aguirre,5,this is a great cartoon series one the best that cartoon network has had on in a long time I love it if your a fan of cartoons you will prolly like it too check it out
B008CS6WJK,Shanbear16,5,This show isn't just for kids; anyone can enjoy it! It's hilarious and often times non sequitur. Great story lines in this season particularly.
B008CS6WJK,SilverJade451,5,Adventure Time!  This season adds more depth to the already wonderful characters as well as some great twists to the plot.
B008DGRDZ8,KOBAM,3,It amazes me that smart people would choose to speak as these do.  I hope people realize the whole industry is not this bad.  Great psychological insights concerning what drives idie game creators.
B008DIY9T4,htmcs,4,Johnny was an odd man . I used to watch him all the time. I guess I never realized that he was so sad in his private life. I truly believe that he needed his mother's love and attention. Clearly he never got it when she was alive. Only in death and the contents on the vox with the clippings....... I think she was too late to help her son.
B008DIY9T4,Jeanie M Nord,5,Refreshingly honest. Respected his audience.  Didn't buy into the Hollywood mind speak.  We will miss hearing Ed say - Here's Johnny!
B008DIY9T4,Sharon,4,Johnny Carson is iconic.  Since he was born in my home State & grew up in Nebraska his personal life wasn't such a surprise to me.  He was just a &#34;good old boy&#34; that made it big.  That always comes with a price.
B008DR2ACI,Gerrob,5,Wilfred is one of the best shows to come around in a long time. This was yet another episode that delves deeply into the human psyche and gets us to think about own own lives and relationships. I love this show!!
B008DR2ACI,therrisaid,5,If you are a dog owner and aren't put off by dry explicit humor absolutely give this a watch. It is hysterical.
B008DZ91U4,lily2279,3,This series did not engage my sensibilities enough to pay for the rest of the episodes. It was mediocre - not exciting enough or actually at all. If it went to Prime I would watch it but not worth any more dollars to view. Sorry. Loved the title.
B008EM1DAC,Claudine,5,We love this show. Nice short episodes (10 Min). So little ones can sit thru the whole show. Nice learning plot line.
B008EM1DAC,Jo Ann Winternheimer,5,My Granddaughter laughs out loud while watching Pocoyo on my Kindle Fire.  She always wants to watch the episodes.  It is good for me also as I can continue watching my shows on TV.
B008EM1DAC,John Johnson,5,My kids love this animated series and spend quite a lot of time on it. Hours go by without losing their interest.
B008EM1DAC,Kindle Customer "knitting hobby",3,I don't get it. This show reminds me of gumby and pokey from the 60's. I didn't want to get it just from the illustration but my grandson wanted to see it so I bought 2 episodes. He is 3 and likes it. I won't buy anymore because I think it is too mind numing. It only gets 3 stars because he loves it. Must be an acquired taste.
B008EM1DAC,M. French,4,For kids recognizing shapes and colors. Pretty goofy if you ever sit and watch it.
B008EPHB28,Cathy,5,My son and I both love Pocoyo...great for little tykes...wish there were more though. He watches them over and over again...
B008EPHB28,Claudine,5,My son loves this show. The episodes are short (10 Min) so it holds his attention. Cute characters and nice plot line.
B008EPHB28,exwyzee8,5,The show is so simple it's brilliant. It's great for teaching young children about sharing and making friends. It's good for adventure and for learning manners. My and my 3 year old little girl love this show. The bonus is I am a huge fan of Steven Fry.
B008EPHB28,Jo Ann Winternheimer,5,Granddaughter is 5 and she likes Pocoyo Season 2 a lot.  Laughs out loud.  Watches the same episodes again after a few days.
B008EPHB28,Stephen C. Rankin,5,A great show that doesn't ramp him up b4 bed. Unique..the epitome of cute fun.that's all I got to say bout that
B008EQHT4M,A. M. Bonito,5,The third season is just as good as the first 2. Sorry to see that Jai is no longer a character towards the end of the season but I really enjoy this.
B008EQHT4M,aztnge,5,I love this show & I especially love Piper ~ she is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen!!
B008EQHT4M,B. Lyn,4,Pure entertainment -not to be believed by any stretch of the imagination!  I think there are too many characters which messes up the continuity
B008EQHT4M,Brittany Thompson,5,This show is a cliff hanger right from the beginning of season 3. There is so much sexual tension and lost love that by the time I got to season 3 I would have bought it if it were $50!!! I am hooked!!
B008EQHT4M,CAR GUY,5,GREAT SERIES THAT YOU CAN SEE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ON TV.  PIPER SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE INTERESTING EACH SEASON.
B008EQHT4M,Cathy P.,4,I really didn't think that i would like this show but its turned out to be really good. The characters are likeable and the storyline is good. The first season appeared to be low budget but its a decent show now. Worth watching.
B008EQHT4M,Chris St Pierre,5,Outstanding way too end this season. The characters and storylines are only getting better and better. Well worth the time to watch. Entertaining without being vulgar.
B008EQHT4M,Colleen Weston,5,I really like these types of shows.  the only thing upsetting is I have watched the entire series from 1 thru 3.  Get to 4 and now they want to charge.  I already pay Amazon for my Roku and don't feel this is right.  But love the show.
B008EQHT4M,Crusader,5,Excellent writing and acting; a very fun show to watch year after year.  A very creative suspense/crime drama without the type of non-stop graphic violence found in other programs in this genre.
B008EQHT4M,DAE,5,wish you had season 4! can't wait to see it in amazon prime. It's good to see a woman lead who has a brain!
B008EQHT4M,Debra D. Thiele,5,Each season gets better and better.  The writers are giving  the characters more depth and expanded personalities and the stories are lasting longer as well; instead of wrapping up at the end of each episode.  I enjoy the wanting of hurrying up to see the next episode just to see what happens next.  Good Job writers.
B008EQHT4M,djdave,5,Lots of good episodes with this season. Others who have checked it oiut of the library have said how much they have enjoyed it as well.
B008EQHT4M,dlrespaul,5,This is a great show - - - good writing - - -interesting charactors - - - good locations .
B008EQHT4M,D. Robertson,5,The best thing bout this series is the fact that the spies are not the normal infallible types in most shows of this genre
B008EQHT4M,eighth,5,Covert Affairs is an enjoyable series with a woman lead character. The supporting cast make an entertaining program seem totally believable. Where else can a very light weight woman beat off men and women and not sustain one scratch?
B008EQHT4M,Evelyn M. Garner "whitehead",4,this is a edge of the chair type TV program..but always  ends well I am up to date on all the episodesand waiting on the next ones to be viewed.
B008EQHT4M,fredd,4,I really like this show can't wait until season 4 comes to prime. I even paid for a few of these shows.
B008EQHT4M,gary blakely,4,great characters and almost real situations....entertaining not too deep....she is fun to watchwith no commercials goes by quickly ...
B008EQHT4M,Genavee,5,I love this season with all the intrigue and new character especially Hill Harper role! Annie has really been great this season I love Piper in this role! Keep Annie and Auggie together!
B008EQHT4M,George Brecht,5,There is a good mix of weekly story lines mixed with longer term stories and issues.  They keep it fresh and keep you guessing.
B008EQHT4M,Gizmo "ctwin60",3,The show is not outstanding but it is not the worst I have seen. The characters are typical and the plots are o.k.
B008EQHT4M,Gregory L. Erickson,5,I like the fact that this series is moving past the bubble-gum & rainbows stage and is assuming a more edgy attitude.
B008EQHT4M,H2oxy,5,This series is good clean fun.  I like the relationship developments and the story lines are exciting and eventful.  Enjoy!
B008EQHT4M,James Gaan "PaiGowMaster",5,Once again a great season.  All great episodes and Piper is hot. I can't wait for season four to be here.
B008EQHT4M,John Boone,5,We enjoy watch Annie as she progresses in her skill set as a spy the interaction she has with her sister in hiding that she is a spy to when she reads her sister in and how Annie handles rejection as well as how Annie and her sister make amends. This is a great show good action. Nice narrations.  The series seems to be well connected between episodes.
B008EQHT4M,John R,4,Covert Affairs is getting better and better and I was disappointed that season 4 is not ready for Amazon Prime!
B008EQHT4M,John T. foster,5,Love this show and it's international intrigue.Good personal stories as well.Acting and story telling get better each season.
B008EQHT4M,K. Anderson "andersox",4,I'm sorry to see the romance story arc with Simon end but hoping we've seen the start of a new one. Also does a good job of creating a new super villian for the CIA to track down.The story was improved by having it produced as dream sequences interspersed with "reality" sequences.
B008EQHT4M,Karen P,5,I watched each episode with Amazon prime and can't wait for the new season.  All of the characters are great.  I think the show will only get better.
B008EQHT4M,K. R. Merryman,5,Each episode has a lot of suspense that keeps your interest. You want to continue to the next episode right away to see what happens next. The acting is very good and the filming quality and locations are not low budget! Watch the first one and your hooked!
B008EQHT4M,Laura Fletcher "WOLF Women",5,Awesome season. I have all three seasons.I will be getting season four when it comes out. Very good acting and story line.
B008EQHT4M,L. Grant,5,I've been finding interesting older series on Prime and enjoying them.  Sometimes straight through the series.  This one is a good one.  Not to mention I like the sassy theme song (even downloaded it from the web).  Characters are good and stories are both fun and fast-paced and fresh.
B008EQHT4M,linda21,5,Great show keeps you in suspense. Acting is good. Piper is great. Now I can watch a the new ones I caught up
B008EQHT4M,M. Anderson,5,I'm so glad that they are making a season 4 because this drama is so fun to watch. I like Piper Perabo as the CIA agent. The stories keep you on the edge of your seat.
B008EQHT4M,Max Remley,5,Glad we stumbled over this one on Amazon Instant Video.  Good plot and good characters.  Definitely worth the time to watch.
B008EQHT4M,Michelle Gould,5,The characters and story line are engaging. The interaction of characters makes you wish you were an CIA agent.
B008EQHT4M,neon,5,it keeps you in suspense with its change overs  and always want to see what happens with the next assignment.
B008EQHT4M,NLJ,5,We watched it together and really loved it. We really like being able to watch two or three episodes in a row. Is there another season? Please say YES!
B008EQHT4M,Powerhouse,5,I stumbled onto the series with the first episode and haven't missed it since! Looking forward to Season 4 next month.
B008EQHT4M,Randall von Schoeler "Garden Guru",5,Been watching all episodes since the beginning.  It is just as good at this point as it was at episode 1.
B008EQHT4M,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,Finished watching Covert Affairs season 3 and had a good time watching this with family. This season keeps you on the edge for some nice action packed drama. The main character is obviously Annie Walker portrayed by Piper Perabo who surprisingly has done some excellent acting. All the other characters has done excellent acting too making this whole season worth watching. Good story-line & never a dull moment. I do like the fact that every episode has something new to watch which takes you to various parts of the globe.Fun filled action packed drama season 1-3 were. I am waiting for Season 4 to become Prime Eligible. Amazon please make that happen. Five stars for season3!
B008EQHT4M,Rebecca Collins,5,This show is spectacular .. I have watched all the seasons and all the shows and want more !  Piper comes on strong - and has never ending talent - she doesn't quit - and sets the screen on fire.  And Auggie !!  .. what can I saw beside awesome.  Together - they are an amazing team which make an incredible show !  Other characters in the show are charismatic also.
B008EQHT4M,Roger L. Boese "FirstConsultant",4,It rough and tumble fun and games.  Figuring out who to trust is hard on the characters.  An interesting season that holds together pretty well.
B008EQHT4M,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I am very pleased with my purchase. This season of Covert Affairs was another great season of the series. I am looking forward to next season of Covert Affairs.
B008EQHT4M,ROY,5,I could hardly wait to get my hands on season 3 to see how she would get into and out of the situations she always gets into.
B008EQHT4M,S. Cowan,4,Next season of Covert Affairs didn't let us down. There is good interplay between the characters and intrigue and interesting twists in the storyline. We enjoy watching it.
B008EQHT4M,Shirley White,5,I have become a big fan of hers.  The stories are intriguing and well acted.  I love a good spy story.  I hope it continues for many more years.
B008EQHT4M,S. Marsh,5,I gave the reviews for the first two series 5 stars because the series was fun to watch. As the series progress the fun has gone and become much more serious. Still look forward to each show but so serious which is more like it should be since it is about the CIA.
B008EQHT4M,Sonja Reid,5,The story lines are fast moving and exciting.  Sometimes it seems a bit convoluted but the twists in the plot resolve and things work out in the end.
B008EQHT4M,St Johns,5,I am a fan of governmental dramas and some sci fi as well.  This may be sort of a cross between 24 and perhaps a little of Alias.  Really enjoy the action and high drama.
B008EQHT4M,Texas Gal "catlady1981",5,Give the spy game a new twist. Love the tension between Augie and Annie. Would like to see them go somewhere with that.
B008EQHT4M,V. Ferguson,5,I like the way they have developed the characters in this show in the past seasons and this one is no exception. The last episode was still a surprise though; I kind of hoped she'd take up with the Mosad character to string it out till she and Augie got together.
B008EQHT4M,Virginia F. Eastwood "ginny",5,Love this show! the characters are great and work together especially Piper. It takes place in different countries and scenery is great. Can't wait for next season. If you love spy shows you will enjoy this one.
B008EQII56,Hiram Davis "HongryHawg",3,Not enough humorous moments.  Typical try-to-hard to be funny but falls flat.  But that's just me.  A 15 year old may get more out of it.
B008ET98Z2,Charlotte Huntley "porpie",3,The hook is which guy will the main character choose? It's stretched on so long now that maybe we don't care.
B008ET98Z2,J. B. Miller,2,This is way to sexually explicit for a young person to act.  I guess the world has changed so that this is normal behavior in some homes.  To bad.
B008ET98Z2,kmoore,5,I liked the first season better but the second one is pretty awesome too. Glad I own it so i can watch it repeatedly
B008ET98Z2,leo clark "bob",3,entertaining but it tends to repeat itself a lot and sometimesdoes not seem very believable. but it does have it's momentsand will grow on you after a while.
B008ET98Z2,ms,5,I can't believe I'm saying this but MTV has a winner in awkward. It's genuinely funny and has some pretty great characters. Some of the love plot lines are ridiculous but the characters keep growing on you. Good for a mindless weekend watch.
B008ET98Z2,roxy,5,Season 2! Almost as good as season1!
B008ET98Z2,skiarc,5,Enjoyed season 2 but thought the main character was starting to look a old for the part and definitely heavier.
B008ET98Z2,S. Robbins "talking to a tortoise",5,Love this show and Jenna and her high school angst.  We should all have such problems!  Like all &#34;teen&#34; shows the teenagers look more like 20 somethings and a little disturbed by the active sex lives they begin at 15-16 years of age.  Now we know where all the teenage mom's come from!
B008ET98Z2,Sylvia Evans,5,I enjoyed it because my granddaughter is 16 years old - this is way different than the teen shows of my day - 16 year olds now are more like me in my 20's I think.  I wonder if the lifestyle is at all true to life for 16 year olds in average however.  The actors are all good and it is great to see issues never talked about in my high school years out in the open today.
B008EYQQPM,DeDe "DeDe",5,I was very upset this afternoon whan I tried to watch the last 5 episodes- I had watched the first 5 with my Prime Membership and all of a sudden it is no longer prime- but will cost.  I was going to leave a 1 star review because I felt cheated- but first I "chatted" with a customer service rep and amazon did what it has always done- in my experience- they made it right.  They gave me a credit to cover the rest of the season.  It took only a few mins and I just ordered them w/no charge.  The season is great and now I can give it what it deserves 5 stars. John Goodman in a complete departure from his usually funny roles is amazing as the creepy religious father- who orders murders like he orders dinner while telling the kids "go ahead open your presents.  Thanks amazon!  can't wait to see the rest.
B008EYQQPM,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",4,This season has even more complexity as the pair seem (at times) to get along. Very complex client line makes this one move quickly.
B008EYQQPM,Ellen Ellis,5,I've watched this series  for 4 seasons. The acting is consistantly great!  Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are both excellent actors and they deserve higher star ratings than the the show is getting in season 4.  Some people are givingpoor ratings with 1-2 stars because of a change in Amazon's policy to not offer it free starting in season 4 with the amazon prime video membership. These poor reviews are bringing the actual show ratings down.  Amazon's policy change has nothing to do with the quality of the actual show. I wish people would rate the acting and writing quality of the show  correctly and not lower it because they're pissed off at Amazon.
B008EYQQPM,J. Otoole,4,Sometimes tough to follow but overall worth your time. Its interesting  john Goodman's charactor is quite complex And he does a good job with it.Nice series
B008EYQQPM,nurse_judith,5,This season 4 of Damages is so full of drama and twist and turns.  It kept me in suspence the whole series.  These are some of the best actors around.  I think you will find this series superior to anything being shown on cable.  It is geared to the late teen and adult viewers.
B008EYQQPM,S. Lee "waterwoman39",4,Suspense carries this series and satisfaction is not guaranteed.  And you keep on watching because new facets of character are revealed in the toughest situations.
B008FWHGYS,jjceo,3,This is a film about the relationships of people and how they unknowingly are interconnected in ways that in some cases they will never truly understand. The movie jumps from country to country and person to person throughout the storyline and in some way they are all connected with each other and usually it involves a sexual relationship of themselves or their partner.  The film features an all-star cast of international movie stars but even such an honor roll of stars could not save this movie.The movie presentation is choppy and the directing is done in the same manner.  The storyline drags in the first half of the movie and it is 40 minutes before Anthony Hopkins makes his first appearance. After Hopkins shows up the film gets gradually better but still not spectacular.  The script and storyline are just generic and no real plot ever develops during the movie.  It is just bland and the film just seemed flat and uninspired.My wife and I still rated it a 3 star presentation but many people will not like it.  The film was better in the second half but it only raised it from a 1.5 to a 3 star rating.  I am not sure that I can truly recommend this film and if I were you I would rent it and not buy the DVD.
B008FWHGYS,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",2,This wasn't my kind of movie at all.  I ended up turning it off before I was one third through.
B008FWHGYS,The OC,2,When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match.  This didn't come close.  It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc.  But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much.  The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking.  Why did I waste the time.  A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc.  But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop.
B008FWHMMO,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",5,Louis CK has been at the top of his game lately. This show is just one example. Also I relate strongly to his middle aged angst. Many of the stories seem to be about me. Not common in today's media.
B008FWHMMO,Cletus van Damme,5,Not to many shows make me feel heart warmed and awkward at the same time. The "asking out" scene pays off so well at the end. Really enjoying this season!
B008FWHMMO,Jerome Donarski,3,This comedy series has improved over time.  Less of the stand up and more heart felt sketch comedy about a middle aged man dealing with the vagaries of life.
B008FWHMMO,nurse_judith,5,This is a great comedy show.  I love the comedy and actors.  I look forward to the new stuff Louise CK has coming out real soon. He is one unique guy this Louis CK and could hold his own on a Tonight Show.  This is definately an adult comedy show.  It really grows on you.....I think you'll like it.
B008GJVAW4,A. Johnson "surfwood4",5,Really fascinating to hear Jobs explain what the internet would become in this 1995 interview. His forecast is precisely what the internet has become in 2014.
B008GJVAW4,Doug R. Troupe "drt568",4,Did not know much about him.Now know some insight on how he was thinking in 1994 working at Next(sp?) in between Apple and Apple.
B008GJVAW4,J. Phillips,5,So much of what was talked about in this interview brought back wonderful memories of what the tech life was like before the internet. I had forgotten how quickly all this happened.
B008GQW1CU,Jenny,4,It was great.  The Queen was or is a great lady.
B008GQW1CU,Nicole,5,Love the way it spans the topic. Wish there was more that I could add to my queue. I would add them in a second!
B008HBEJOW,normaporter,4,This show is a fresh way to go paranormal hunting. I have watched two seasons and have enjoyed each show.
B008HZEJ5W,David Swayne,4,A good independent film which was well cast. The comedy is reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie. I found this film very entertaining and would suggest it to anyone who wants to watch a fun heartwarming movie.
B008HZEJ5W,DIYDanielle "DIYDanielle",2,I chose to watch this because I typically like Chris Rock and I was hoping for a movie that was light and funny. This movie was more "artsy" and that's not my style so this movie just didn't work for me.
B008IYMWYW,Amazon Customer,3,I liked it ok.  Seems like they were creating drama instead of letting the show be a show. That is it.
B008IYMWYW,Larry R. Rhude,5,I had no idea that the waters of the Great Lakes could be as challenging and dangerous as Ocean waters.  Very informative.
B008IYMWYW,Lurch,3,I was interested at first but the language and the same drama as every other boat show out there.  Really lets bring back some history things and let these sink into the water
B008IYMWYW,Pam S.,1,It just wants so badly to be deadliest catch......and it is just so not deadliest catch. It doesn't take long for you to get REAL SICK AND TIRED of the same darn graphic of a tugboat sinking.*No tugboats or tugboat captains were harmed in the writing of this review.
B008JAGM6Y,Amazon Customer,5,Not much more to say but you have to check out tis show if you like this type of genera better than House in my opinion
B008JAGM6Y,David Lehmann,5,Good theme and acting. Streaming lets you do this as it best fits your schedules. Watch many of the episodes.
B008JAGM6Y,Eugene Gutierrez,3,I bought the pilot episode and I wasn't buying the lead's quirks.  The trend now in TV is to find flawed lead characters but this guy just wasn't believable.  The season is a Not Buy but based soley on the pilot episode.
B008JAGM6Y,Janet Gagej,4,I realized that I had recorded all of season 1 on my DVR and am awaiting Season 2.  It will also be automatically recorded on my DVR and I can also watch it on Dishanywhere.
B008JAGM6Y,jim,4,I enjoy the cases and idea behind this show it is a good watch and am looking forward to season 2
B008JAGM6Y,Joyce Gilliland,5,this is a great series. i hope they keep it going. It reminds me of a Beautiful Mind which is one of my favorite movies.
B008JAGM6Y,M. Kennedy,5,Perception is probably the only show on this network that I watch regularly.  A character who personifies the word and it's fun to match wits with him and try to solve the mystery.
B008JAGM6Y,Page 2,1,It was silly Not a good story line. I could not get into the story. actors were not real enough to hold my interest.
B008JAGM6Y,Richard "Dickie",4,But six episodes do not make much of a season. Plus the cost of it was high. Will rent from now on.
B008JAGM6Y,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,Seriously if I want politics then I'll watch the news. This thing has way too much political undertones that are not even subtle to be likable. I'm used to some politics but this series reminds me of Cars 2 with its ham-fisted approach to political issues.
B008JSNIQS,charity,5,Even though all they do on this show is chase mythical creatures around the world I still can't get enough of it. Josh Gates and Erin Ryder are hilarious together and when situations get intense I just can't pull myself away from the TV.
B008JSNIQS,Gary R. Jordan,5,I enjoy these types of programs.Josh Gates it a fearless host and the show is produced well.Worth the price.
B008JSO21S,Amazon Customer,5,Usually when season 3 and 4 roll around things start to feel stale.  But the writers of Warehouse 13 just keep the twists coming and make the story line interesting and moving forward.  Claudia stole a lot of this season.  I am looking forward to the final 6 episodes to see how the writers tie it all up.
B008JSO21S,Amazon Customer,5,I haven't been hooked on a Sci-Fi show since the Star Trek DS9 and VOY went off the air but I love this series! It was great seeing Jeri Ryan and Kate Mulgrew in past seasons(looks like from previews Kate Mulgrew is coming back this season too!).. and loved seeing Brent Spiner in the season premiere! Hope this show doesn't get canceled!
B008JSO21S,Ann Shumaker,4,Glad it has lasted this long! Easy family viewing for the younger guys. Not for little ones but your older elementary and middle schoolers. In the vein if &#34;The Librarian&#34;. We have really enjoyed it.
B008JSO21S,Blue Moose,3,This is a relatively good scifi series. Some times it is a little hard to follow and sometimes it seems to get into back stories that don't seem related. But it holds your attention.
B008JSO21S,Bob,5,This is a great show!  Funny and cool and imaginative!!  It has great characters too!  I can't wait to see what happens next!!
B008JSO21S,Carole M,4,Warehouse 13 is goofy but fun. Characters are weird but fit.  Actors are great in their parts. Something's changed this year with Myka appearance-wise.  Maybe hair is much darker or frizzier or both.  A good show if you like to suspend disbelief and talk back to your tv.
B008JSO21S,Cat,3,I enjoy it for the most part..there is some fun wit in the writing and the actors arejust fine..the stories can be fun.  It's just fine for what it is..light and fluffy but entertainingand that is exactly what I like at times..I like the new quirky actress..she has a fun characterand that adds a lot and I think with time it will be getting better and better..it's still new to meand I am starting at the beginning never before having watched it even tho it's been around..My Roku has given me that ability..and I love my Roku!!
B008JSO21S,Citizen John,4,I think this is a pretty interesting series and season 4 is a good one.  There are so many boring moments one just has to get past to be rewarded with the good ones.
B008JSO21S,Diane S,5,I love this whole series. Watched it through Ruko. Beautiful picture in hd on my TV screen. Amazon prime instant video is a wonderful option to paid TV.
B008JSO21S,D. Moore "Dano",5,This is TV at its best....This is what I like to see... Week in & out.If you want some good fun kick TV.. Warehouse 13 is it.
B008JSO21S,Dominic Freeman,5,I love this show. The chemistry between the characters is wonderful.  I would like to believe certain objects posses powers or properties. The story lines are terrific.
B008JSO21S,Edward H. Bell,5,I have always been a fan of the Warehouse 13 series. Good family fun. I am pleasantly surprised to see this season 4 offered as a Prime membership bonus and am catching up on the characters and plots that I would otherwise have missed.Thank You for all of your Prime movies.
B008JSO21S,E. Helms,4,Silly science fiction fun. Like Eureka it is light and very hard to believe science fiction fun. Likable characters and villans. Recommend for any science fiction buff. Does have adult themes so not for kids.
B008JSO21S,Ekay,5,Each episode is an action packed fun-filled ride with an engaging cast of characters that are well developed and consistent in the acting delivery. Kudos to the acting cast and the writers / developers for keeping the magic alive episode by episode.
B008JSO21S,Ellen M. Sorensen "mtnmaggie",5,not your run of the mill show but fun to watch. each week has something new and out of the ordinary
B008JSO21S,Fredddd,5,Certainly leaves you wanting to see the next season.This series is not filthy or foul.  Makes it enjoyable.  It has humor and drama.Really enjoy it.And headspinning plots LOL.
B008JSO21S,G. "Beam",5,fun to watch...lots of odd adventures... the characters are funny and the plots are interesting...its a great show... watch it
B008JSO21S,greg,5,Watch this with the wife and very much enjoyed it. I wish it would continue being a favorite of ours
B008JSO21S,happydigging,5,Love the way they use historical things in this show and keep you guessing.  Can't wait for the next season.  Thanks Amazon for having this one PRIME.
B008JSO21S,henrietta zielinski,5,i liked the little bit of partly true and partly fictional story lines.  poetic license for sure but great fun
B008JSO21S,Ingie,4,Quirky and fun show. The characters are wonderful and unique and they meld nicely. The historical references and the warehouse spin is nice.
B008JSO21S,jim,4,Warehouse 13 has from the beginning been a good series and this one is no exception another good season . such a shame it's coming to an end next summer
B008JSO21S,jimmarx,5,Love the characters and the interaction.  It have a good mixture of funny and touching moments.  It can go anywhere with all the artifacts that cause anything the mind can come up with.  Great show.
B008JSO21S,J. Ligon "JimL",5,If you like the series this will float your boat. High adventure with a very good cast that I can identify with.
B008JSO21S,johnstars,4,can never get enough of this show this was not my favorite the part about the musician and the healingwas interesting.There can be a wonderful exchange of energy between player and audience! When listeners andplayer connect it is truly Magic. I know I play and it happens all the time to me!Johnstars
B008JSO21S,Jolynn Raymond,4,We really like this show. it's funny with well developed quirky characters and the storylines stay fresh and unique from other shows. It's great to be able to watch one after another in a mini marathon so you don't have to wait to see what happens. One reason Amazon Prime is nice.
B008JSO21S,JOSE PEREGRINA DE LA P,4,It does not has the best special effects but is a good tv show to have a good relaxing time .
B008JSO21S,Justicried,5,This is a light entertaining & imaginative program.  The characters draw you in.  It is really too bad they didn't keep this going.  They had endless material & so many stories left to tell.
B008JSO21S,KELLY MCCRADIC,5,It took me a few episodes to get into this but now that we are in season for I'm a huge  fan! Love all the characters even Mrs. Fredricks who's a big creepy :)
B008JSO21S,LADONNA HARVEY "LaHarvey",5,This show has characters with good relationships with each other and are interesting. The different items with special powers is a interesting twist. It's hard to watch just one!
B008JSO21S,Lynn McBee,5,This was a very good season of this show. They did a good job of plot development and left me wanting to see the next season.
B008JSO21S,Mal,5,This show is fantastic! Great sci-fi and mystery without being cheesy. And the humor is spot on. I definitely recommend this show.
B008JSO21S,Mardee "Mardee",5,It just keeps getting better and better.  I have watched all the seasons and this has been the best yet.
B008JSO21S,melvin watkins,5,I really enjoyed this series very much and hope that the network will make more episodes .this was an awesome show.
B008JSO21S,Mg Gallegos13 "taxed with books",5,The only bad thing about this show is that I have to pay to watch it (no cable TV). The characters are great (though I'm not sure about the new B & B owner).
B008JSO21S,M. Grant "minimum wage extravagance",5,I love how this show incorporates different genres of information and sprinkles it over this delicious cake of entertainment! Pete is my fave character!!
B008JSO21S,Michelle DuBose,5,This is a great show.  It is a little something different.  Funny and addictive.  You will fall in love with the characters.
B008JSO21S,MNMJFoley,5,This series is very fun and intelligent. One of the best that SyFy has produced. Not much gore and lots of character and plot development. Love it!
B008JSO21S,Moo,5,Awesome show. Fun to watch. This is a great sci fi show with a good story line. If you have not watched do so this very evening.
B008JSO21S,Nan,5,This series always keeps me going. I really enjoy it and look forward to the upcoming season. Hope it comes soon.
B008JSO21S,Oldsoldier22 "Chief3lw",3,I actually watched the first 2 seasons on tv. I gave only 3 stars because the males seem to be depicted as having gotten mush in the brain since the first episode and act a little like weak women. While the women seem to have taken over and are front and center. Not as good a show to me now and that is why I stopped watching it on tv. I know the &#34;matriarchy is coming&#34; but come on Hollywood not yet :(
B008JSO21S,P. Alexander "savyshopper",5,I chose 5 stars because I love this show and will choose it over almost any other shows I have recorded. A new Bones might be the possible exception. I enjoy the historical references and the imagination of whoever comes up with the artifact ideas. I'm not a sitcom humor sort of person but these characters are funny in a believable way as you get to know their characters. There are twists that keep you from guessing the ending.
B008JSO21S,Pattye Heuer,5,The writers are the best!  They took a great story line and added great actors. What i really appreciate about this show is that the writers wrote great shows and didn't feel the need to include constant profanity and senseless violence.  I love it.  Its very sad that the show is in it last season.  I will miss it.  We need more writers and shows like this.
B008JSO21S,P. B. Terry,4,Season 4 continues the saga that is warehouse 13. It's a fun show and if you've made it to season 4..nothing in this review will persuade you one way or the other.
B008JSO21S,P. Shanahan "Fathead",5,Rarely does this series disappoint. Great adventure and mystery peopled by a wonderful ensemble cast. You get swept up in the fun the cast seems to be having. The added bonus of no commercials makes it all a breathless fun house ride. Tall tales meet a police procedural -- great fun and a great escape!
B008JSO21S,Pulpman,3,I really enjoy this show most of the time but this season is not fun. It is very dark and serious. It also has what I call a comic book death. There is too much menace and killing to really enjoy the show. The light fun is gone. Even when it is fun there is not enough to allieviate the dark and menacing element now present.The show is worth watching don't get me wrong it is just not the light entertainment I am use to. This season and last season they seem to be heading for the dark brooding show such as Angel or Forever Knight.
B008JSO21S,Rotatiller,4,This season is very intense. It is more serious and on the edge of your seat stuff going on. Still has a lot of fun in it and action but a bit more serious. I only give it a 4 because of the gay theme they have put in the show.
B008JSO21S,ROY,5,As with all the other seasons they left you hanging as to will there be another wonderful story.  Each episode was as good as the last one.  I hope they will continue with is great series..
B008JSO21S,R. Roberts,5,Warehouse 13 Season 4 was just as pleasurable as the previous seasons of this hit television show.  The show is entertaining and a pleasure to watch.  If a fan of the show I don't think you will be put off.  Definitely a watch worthy show.
B008JSO21S,Samantha English,5,Love this show! Myka and Pete are great together and everyone loves Claudia and Artie!
B008JSO21S,setzco,4,Still coming out with good stories.  Like the concept of the show secret government wharehouse of artifacts hidden away to protect the public; although adding an underlying message that takes away rather than add to the stories...
B008JSO21S,sharon kemm,5,warehouse 13 is a must see. it's truly an adventure with a thrill a minute. it ended but I want to see more. are you going to make more?
B008JSO21S,S. Lasher,5,Very interesting story lines and like able characters. Keeps me coming back for more. A little over the top at times but still good fun.
B008JSO21S,snowdogozzie,5,It's different than most other TV shows that I watch and I like that. It also makes you wonder if there are real &#34;artifacts&#34; out there!
B008JSO21S,Stephanie Lynn Moore,5,A lot of this series bends the imagination to a very stimulating brain tease.  I love watching this and will probably go back for seconds.
B008JSO21S,Steve Bystrak,5,Will miss it
B008JSO21S,Susie "galaxygirl",5,Everyone was at their best - or worst depending on how you look at them.  It just wish it hadn't been the setting stage for the end of the series.  True entertainment is rare these days and a story you can lose yourself in for a while is even more rare.  The Warehouse really is a living entity of endless wonder - and I will miss my favorite characters so much.  My streaming and DVDs are going to get a MAJOR workout frequently in the future.
B008JSO21S,sybille ziegler,5,Being a huge fan of Eureka I was disappointed when they stopped it but Warehouse 13 is just amazingly funny and keeps me looking forward to yet another season!
B008JSO21S,temprance debe,5,Episodes have good story lines and fun humor.  The actors are compatible and produce a much appreciated escape to another experience to just sit back and enjoy.  I trust that they are not going to fill my head with a negative bizarre experience of murder and mayhem.  (:
B008JSO21S,The repair guy,4,Look scifi has always been a little corny at times but that is what makes it good. Warehouse has made it great by the Characters inner mingling with each other in a great continuing story. The effects are top shelf and the writing is solid I like it and will continue to be a fan and watch as long I can find an episode to view.
B008JSO21S,Value Shopper Pensacola,5,I began watching Warehouse 13 when it first became available on Netflix.  I really enjoy this series and I appreciate Amazon making it available on Amazon Prime.  Thank You.
B008JSO21S,Vic Graninger,2,The writers and producers took the series into a direction that is away from the formula which worked well - now it is formulaic and not worth watching.
B008JSO786,A. Coleman "A. Mom",5,I enjoyed season 2 of Alphas! The story line kept me interested.  I hope the ending was not the final episode!  I would like to see a season 3.
B008JSO786,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I got hooked on Alphas starting with Season 2 and going back to watch Season 1. The end of Season 2 is a shocker which seems to end the show altogether which was utterly disappointing. There were some things that reminded me of Heroes but Alphas does it better!
B008JSO786,Antonio,5,Awesome! Very upset that they would cancel this show after only 2 seasons? Why won't another network pick it up? Ridiculous.
B008JSO786,Baker,4,I found this series very entertaining.  It kept my attention due to the investigation of super natural events.  This program is a syfy plus.
B008JSO786,Barbara,5,This is a really great show.  I wish it would it would not have been cancelled and would come back on.
B008JSO786,Blue Moose,4,It has been a good series. It holds your interest and always makes you want to come back and view the next episode.
B008JSO786,BrendaMarie,3,Another very good Alpha.  Sometimes I think the plot moves along too fast.  But our favorites are there.  The story makes you want to watch more.
B008JSO786,conejito asesino,5,*some nonspecific spoilers*Normally cliffhanger endings piss me off but in this case I will make an exception. Loved it! Love the character developement on this show. Love that they brought back Summer Glau. Love that they have Sean Astin. Love that the girls get to be the ones who save the world with their minds instead of the boys with their guns. Love all the new questions that this episode brought up. I can't wait for the new season!
B008JSO786,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,Alphas is very good and it is not like the other stories like X Men and Mutant X. This series have a better story line and I like all the characters with their special abilities.  I think Alphas is a better word than mutants.  I hope it will make it to the next season.
B008JSO786,Debbie Dillon,5,Had never seen this show before and found it to be very entertaining. Wish the show would have lasted longer
B008JSO786,Diane S,5,I love this show.  I really wish it had not been canceled.  I watched the first season on Netflix and the only place I could find the 2nd season was on Amazon.  Excellent HD quality!
B008JSO786,Dusguicheon "Baer",5,I was thrilled to see Season 2 is now available on Amazon Prime Videos!  This is an intelligently written show with great special effects and interesting characters who happen to have amazing abilities. Much better than 90 percent of the crap that's on prime time TV.  I wish Amazon or even NetFlix would see the value in producing this series themselves. Thoroughly entertaining!
B008JSO786,Ebbo,5,Finally a TV series that has good chemistry between it's characters. I truly enjoy watching this because the characters care for one another and even though they each have their own demons figure a way to get past them and help the people in need.
B008JSO786,Elisha C. Douglas,3,Would love to see them develop the relationships with the team better. I mean if they are partners why are they arguing all the time?and wouldn't it be awesome if Rosen was a secret Alpha?
B008JSO786,G. Childers,5,Wonderful series. Tragic it was cancelled after 2nd season.  I always enjoyed how the team came to care for and respect each other despite their vastly different personalities.  David Strathairn should've gotten an Emmy for his acting.
B008JSO786,GKJ,4,Enjoyed this show! It was intense with good action. This episode left me with anticipation for the next week episode.
B008JSO786,Gray,2,I had high hopes for this but it just seems to average and plain in it delivery and viewing experience to make you care if you come back week after week.
B008JSO786,JV,5,I love this show please keep it coming I am missing it the actors are awesome can't wait to see what season three with bring which I hope will be soon.
B008JSO786,Keanon Pete,5,This season was definitely one of the highlights of the fall television season. Hopefully more people will give this show a try and show Syfy that this show is worth keeping around a few more seasons. Syfy should consider having an actor from Warehouse 13 or there new show Defiance guest star on Alphas in order to attract some new viewers.
B008JSO786,Laura,5,A continuation of Alpha 1. I like the new characters that are added..it continues to keep my interest as the team works together to try and capture the bad Alpha leader who is unable to be killed.
B008JSO786,Marlon,4,Enjoyable for its genre. Interesting characters. Okay build to the season and series finale as the show has been cancelled.
B008JSO786,Money_Maker,3,The alphas is ok about super power human beings it has a good storyline  if nothing else is on tv to watch this will fill in
B008JSO786,Necie,5,I never watched until I started streaming it...this is a great series and I am hooked I wonder if it is still in procduction.
B008JSO786,Patricia Ann,3,At the beginning of Season 1 this show had an edge but the show has been watered down.David Strhairn's character has been softened and the writer's can't seem to balance the timethey give to each character.
B008JSO786,Paula,5,Because it's very interesting. It just keeps getting better.the stars fit the people they play. Keep it coming please. Thanks
B008JSO786,Prefl96,5,Never heard of this show before coming across it on Prime. Really enjoy it and hope there are more seasons to come.
B008JSO786,Richard A. Luc "Luke",4,SyFy channel presenting thesecond season with the old crew back and a new member added.The most powerful member the "pusher" goes AWOL and out of control for  a while which is interesting (and then some). The autistic savant is rescued from a government facility- and a bunch of bad mutants escape which reforms the team to out and recapture them along with trying to find the series's "Professor Moriarty" ie a mutant who apparently has been alive since the 1800's and is masterminding the upcoming Mutant War (while denying he is trying to do this of course).A lot of fun
B008JSO786,RJK,4,It was a great sci fi adventure which keeps your interest throughout. It was well worth the time of watching.
B008JSO786,Robert Lange,4,Another good show bites the dust thatnks to Fox' who gives a crap about the viewer attitude. It's just another example of why people are watching cable stations instead of the dinosaurs of braodcasting like Fox.
B008JSO786,Sharon,5,I liked the characters just when there story lines were being developed the show endedApparently superhero shows can't magically keep there audience coming back each week
B008JSO786,Sue Boyle "blue9244",4,Another wonderful series that I somehow missed when I had a TV.  Now I'm streaming from Netflix and Amazon and have stumbled onto some very well done series.  I'm so glad I have the opportunity to watch them now at my leisure but best of all WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!
B008JSO786,sweetpea,4,Alphas is full of normal folks with super powers in one particular area.  They are flawed. No perfect endings.  I love that they have a person with a disability (autism?) who contributes and is not treated like a mascot.
B008JSO786,Terri,5,I really loved this show.It was packed full of different kinds of action and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Can't wait till the next one comes out. I will deffinetly watch any further shows that  come on.
B008JSO786,V. Ferguson,5,First rate actors in highly believable roles. The story lines are well thought out and rarely fail to catch my full interest no matter how ticked off I get at some of the ways they screw up and then live with the consequences. I like the way they have developed the character Gary especially. Great show that I enjoy watching - highly recommend if you are looking for more humanity and less violence.
B008JSOXLW,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I started watching White Collar late in the game and went backwards to catch up on all the episodes from the first 2 seasons. I really love Matt Bomer in this role. I love the relationship between Peter and Neal and the newest suspicious addition to the White Collar family this season.
B008JSOXLW,Amanda,5,White Collar is one of the best shows I have watched in a while. I actually just started watching it but I bought all of the previous 3 seasons and am now caught up. Can't wait for season 5.
B008JSOXLW,amrbilly,5,it was great show and it kept getting better better better and i cant wait for 5th season. it worth to buy season 4!
B008JSOXLW,Christopher Rech,5,Love these show! The characters are funny and convincing and we can't wait to see what the next season brings!
B008JSOXLW,G. L. Oneal,5,This is a highly entertaining show. Great story line. Hope good shows like this keep going. Good for the whole family
B008JSOXLW,Helen E. Dowd "HD",3,I enjoyed the season that I watched. I was dying to to know where it was going. Not sure will watch the rest of it though.
B008JSOXLW,Holly S. Porter,5,Love this show!Of course usually when I like a show it gets cancelled-hope that does not happenI love all the characters they are a great ensemble
B008JSOXLW,J. C. Wiltshire,5,Great show with excellent writing and plot twists. A clean show that still provides a little something for everyone in the family!
B008JSOXLW,Jordan,5,This is a great Show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Neil Caffrey is awesome and one of the best counterfeiters ever. Great show you will not be disappointed!!
B008JSOXLW,Lauren,4,I love white collar but your streaming is not so great.  it stops and starts A LOT.  I work on my patience when it is time to watch
B008JSOXLW,Randolph Miller,5,White collar has always been a refuge from long winters.  Most shows set in New York portray NY as this really gritty city.  White Collar usually shows  clean streets and sunny days.  And I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle.
B008JSOXLW,Shannon Castleberry,5,I chose this show because it was something I thought would be easy to watch and fun. I can say it is both of those but it also makes me feel good as it is very cleverly done with great acting and just one of those shows you find yourself addicted to. The stars are perfect for the roles they play and I can't see anyone else playing the characters. Perfect casting!! Love it and them!!
B008JSOXLW,Susan Harris,5,Great Series.  I love the cast.  They meld well together and their personalities are all over the place.  They keep you guessing.  Anticipation of what will happen next keeps me coming back week after week and impatiently waiting for the next season to start up again.
B008JSOXLW,Suzi,5,I love this show!  We don't have cable so Amazon is how I watch new release shows.  The price is reasonable and I don't have to pay for a bunch of stuff I don't want.
B008JSOXLW,thomas marcelain,5,i have been trying to find this show online and its not available. But with amazon prime its amazing to be able to watch it again.
B008JSOXLW,Vico96,5,White Collar is one of the best shows on TV.  Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay are so awesome together!!  They really make you feel for their characters and have me laughing all the time.  They rock!!
B008LRAS5Q,Chefgrandma,5,My 4 year old granddaughter watches this a lot and learns about animals she has never seen or heard of before. The program is tastefully done. I find it educational and entertaining for children of her age.
B008LRAS5Q,Daniel D Duran,1,I wanted this to download into the Kindles memory so my kid could play this show in the car while on long drives.  Unfortunately it won't play unless you're connected to the net.  Neither can I get a refund.  I'm not very happy.
B008LRAS5Q,DStoor,5,AWESOME SHOW KIDS LOVE IT AND IT IS VERY EDUCATIONAL. JUST HAD TO LET THE KIDS KNOW WE DO NOT INTERFEAR WITH NATURE. ANAMALS EAT ANIMALS AND THAT IS GOOD FOR THE ECOSYSTEM.
B008LRAS5Q,Linda Wilson,4,My granddaughter is a fan of Wild Kratts when she comes to my house she asks to watch it.  She is 3 1/2 and will sit through the whole show.
B008LRAS5Q,lLily,5,Cris and Martin taught my a lot about animals like mimicry and lots of other things it was a lot of fun watching the Kratt brothers in their mission to save the animals!
B008LRAS5Q,M. Albaugh,5,My 5-yr-old and 2-yr-old both really like this show. It's fun and educational (albeit quite fanciful on the invention side). I even like watching it. :-)
B008LRAS5Q,mary deleal,5,This is such a good show for 5 year olds and above. I really liked it. My 3 year old granddaughter was a little afraid of some parts so its best to censor what is right for your child
B008LRAS5Q,razrbax5280,5,The show is entertaining and educational.  Our kids love watching it everyday.  The series is free for Prime members.  Well worth it.
B008LRB1O8,DS "Say something about yourself!",5,Really good acting and writing exploring the modern political landscape.Too bad it was conceived as a one season show.  I would have liked to see more.
B008LRB1O8,Patricia Appelquist,5,Ok guilty pleasure here I like Sigourney Weaver. While we all look at her like a the Hillary Clintonesque model I just don't find this version of Hillary believable ...I mean the presidents plane slips? what are the wheels made out of roller skates?
B008LRB1O8,Richard Pokallus,5,I loved this series Political Animals: The Complete First Season I hope they do a second season. The cast that they picked for this series is what makes this series works.
B008LRB1O8,Shannon Castleberry,5,I love this show. It has great acting and a very good plot line each week. I want to see it continue for a long time.
B008LUC32E,Amazon Customer,5,i wish they allowed them to stay on longer.  I think this version got rushed along but I'm sure if they had more time for another season they would have developed everything wonderfully.  It is always entertaining and a show that should not have stopped so suddenly especially since they had good ratings for both of the last seasons and would have had even more success had they not been rushed to end with the last season before it really got started.
B008LUC32E,bannaner,4,This episode really shows Christian Kane's depth as an actor. It really was &#34;his&#34; episode. I never get tired of watching the show.
B008LUC32E,C. A. Swift,5,I have purchased all of the other seasons and was so upset to hear that this show was cancelled. I loved every show and I'll go further to say that this season was excellent and I'll purchase it when it comes out in dvd.
B008LUC32E,Chris's Review,5,Great series to watch. Timothy Hutton does a great drunk who is trying to stop. He gets these thieves to vwork on the good side oh and Elliott is just hot!
B008LUC32E,conejito asesino,5,loved this episode! Are they all getting more good looking as the show progresses? Woderfull! It felt very action movie-ish. Christian Kane was smoldering!
B008LUC32E,DS "Say something about yourself!",5,All 5 seasons were great in their own way.The characters grew without sacrificing the interesting and complicated plot twists.I'm sorry to see it go.
B008LUC32E,L,4,One of the best episodes.  It was the first time Elliott said something nice to Hardison.  I love this show!
B008LUC32E,Marian,5,Absolutely loved all the episodes... Each one of the group has their own speciality. Mostly learned using those gifts as criminals... but now they are like Modern Day &#34;Robin Hood's&#34;... They help those who can not help themselves in the way that is needed. I love all the characters and have watched all Seasons... and will miss them terribly if they do not continue the series...
B008LUC32E,Marie Guerierri "PC Analyst/Programmer",5,The cast and writing make this an excellent TV series.  Great fun to watch!  THis is one of the more clever television series on TV today.
B008LUC32E,Mary Ceparano,5,Leverage season 5 is awesome.Too bad it is the final season. Timothy Hutton is a awesome actor. I enjoyed watching this show. Its too bad it has to end. They always end the good series too soon.
B008LUC32E,raten51,5,The first time I watched the show Leverage I was hooked . I like the way all the characters mingle with each other. All the characters play such great roles which makes the show Leverage work.
B008LUC32E,Steven T. "Steve",5,I love these shows.  They are very entertaining.  I have all the seasons and enjoy them over and over again.  The final season wraps it up nicely.
B008LUC32E,Tammie Hurst,5,This is one of many series that we hated to see end.  So as always I bought it to be able to watch it as many times as I feel necessary since they aren't making more.
B008LUC32E,Tom,4,Always a great series. Why do I need more words just to get the thing done here. The last two sentences are redundant.
B008N6X3BG,DENISE NAVARRO,5,I have always loved this show. I like to see all the great new designers out there. Am always shocked by the things that the good designers come up with.
B008N6X3BG,H. Jeanne Rockwell,4,Have every season from this series and can't wait for next one.  Seems to be getting more variation in designers where you are pretty sure who will be voted off pretty quickly.
B008N6X3BG,Wes B.,5,This is the 10th anniversary of Project Runway and it seems to recapture the magic of the show.  Designers are strong and very opinionated throughout the entire season.  It is a good ride.
B008NNY1U6,Randy,2,The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch.  Too deep for my taste.  I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters.
B008O2QERY,CEPeters,5,My three year old daughter LOVES these guys!!!  I wish they would make some new shows though.  I have seen each episode at least six times each.
B008O2QERY,CrimsonKannon,5,My kids truly enjoy the learning and super hero antics the Kraft brothers show with their cartoon show and their real life conservation of the wild.
B008O2QERY,Jennifer DeBoin,5,My twin 2 yr olds and 5yr old love it! great show for boys and girls and very educational. Cute concept!
B008O2QERY,Junior "Clouseau",5,This is my Grandson's FAVORITE!  He watches it on TV constantly so now he can watch it whenever he wants.
B008O2QERY,lLily,5,My daughters thought it was funny funny when Danita Dona ta got a honey badger instead of a cheetah cub it was hilarious.
B008O2QERY,Luke Tembreull,4,My 4 year old loves this show.  She learns about animals and giggles most of the time.  What more could a parent want.
B008O2QERY,penlight,5,still awesome at vol2. my kids love wild kratts and learn tons every time they watch it. the kratt brothers are very energetic and enthusiastic. listening to them makes you feel happy.this and curious george i could let my kids watch all day long.
B008O2QERY,razrbax5280,5,Educational and fun! Our kids love animals and they learn so much while watching this show and the overall series.
B008OIH7AQ,diane,2,kin of a run of the mill plot
B008OIH7AQ,mjordan,4,This movie made me go check every door and window in my house before I went to bed.  If you like real drama this is it.
B008OIH7AQ,Skillet Black "Three Seasons",3,I really liked Gary Cole.....he did a good job in this movie....but Fatal Vision....another true military officer who killed his entire family....was better. While creative liberties were taken regarding the retelling of Canadian Air Force commander Russell Williams....this movie does give you the basics of the case. The &#34;Tweed Creeper&#34; as papers nicknamed him......went from stealing underwear.....to leaving frightening notes.....to attacks where he photographed his victims in different underwear attire.....to then actually killing. One woman he killed....he knew from the base. This man was in charge of the safety of many Canadian elites and visiting dignitaries....even at one point...the Royals. He was a flight specialists when Prince Charles and Princess Di visited Canada and for the Queen as well. All the while...while it took years....he developed into a cereal killer. This was an okay made for tv movie. If you have time to kill....watch it. If your time is precious....look for another flick.
B008OIH7AQ,Wife Mother Moon Child "&#34;Grandma&#34;",3,This movie held my interest and made me aware again that appearances can be deceiving.  Perception is reality until proven differently.
B008POASKK,John,4,I have always liked Orlando Bloom. He is great in this with a beautiful young patient. Doctors can go off the rails just like any of us. Orlando Bloom's character sure did. I did not buy it but enjoyed it.
B008QTTGGG,Aislinn,5,Loved this one. Monroe goes all out for the holiday. I wish he lived near me. I loved the &#34;woman in white&#34; aka La Llorona. Great action and great adventure. Love Monroe borrowing a piece of Nick's Grimm gear for his Halloween set up.
B008QTTGGG,AUBREYGAMMON3,5,That My Favorite TV SERIE  On Every Week On Friday Night. I All Ways Recorded On DVD Player. I Never Get Tire To Watching.
B008QTTGGG,babydoc,5,I love this show.I hope it goes on for 8 seasons and I will be buying each season on amazon.
B008QTTGGG,Barbara E. Blanco,5,Hubby can't stand scarey programs but I watch on my tv and enjoy the program  slight comedy and all the program offers in solving cases. Makes me think folks are like that without the facial changes...deep down inside!
B008QTTGGG,Bevvie,5,Great series ... Never a dull moment...if you last off the wall scarey tales it's great....based on Grimm fairy tales...love it....
B008QTTGGG,Blue isle #3,5,My husband and I like it a lot we are not to much into fictional type of shows but this particular program we enjoy. We both make it our special time in the evenings to sit and watch a few epksodes to see what is happening next.
B008QTTGGG,Blue Moose,4,This series is an attention holder and requires some thought to follow what is going on. It is loosely based on Grimm fairy tale characters.
B008QTTGGG,Brendan Ferraro "ferraro38",5,What are the best shows I've seen a very long time I have about six shows that I watch I think they all pretty great and ice think they should stay on the air and you guys should keep them on prime
B008QTTGGG,Cathy Hinds,5,I would recommend this show to anyone who likes super natural themes.  The Grimm is worth the watch hope to see it continue
B008QTTGGG,ccc,5,kept u waiting to see what was happening next enjoyed the dif stories with everyone envolved will continue to watch
B008QTTGGG,Chris Crawford,4,Of course you always know the outcome but they have great ways of getting there. I do recommend this for others.
B008QTTGGG,DebbieT,5,The Grimm program is awesome! My daughter and I have been glued to it right from the start! Great actors and the special affects are amazing!
B008QTTGGG,Debra Cook,4,This is the show my husband likes.  It seems very interesting. I hope to see it on the air for some time!
B008QTTGGG,Dominic Freeman,4,I have been binge watching these episodes and have begun to enjoy this show. I'm sure at some point we have all imagined someone that looks like something other than who  or what they truly are. I know I have. So it's not not of a stretch for me to accept this premis.
B008QTTGGG,DVSRomad,5,Grimm continues to entertain and keep my interest in the characters and story lines.  Season 1 was great and Season 2 is as well!
B008QTTGGG,eaglegrafix,3,Trying too hard and the good stories suffered.  Resolution if Julliett takes the whole season. Good but not as good as Season 1. Relies too much on romantic twists.
B008QTTGGG,Edris Cooper,5,Have to limit ourselves to one episode a day..........love it too much!!!!!!!!!!More seasons PLEASE!!!!  It just gets better - all the time.
B008QTTGGG,Edward H. Bell,5,I enjoy the Grimm series. Being able to view this series as a Prime member is a terrific benefit of my membership.- The characters and the story line are expanded and offer good fun.Highly Recommended
B008QTTGGG,Eman,5,The second season is even better than the first. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I hope season three is as good as the first two.
B008QTTGGG,Eric Schneider,3,The main story is still the same and a bit repetitive but the side stories including character development is growing.  The series is worth watching and season 3 will probably be good as well. Maybe a 4 star with broadening the concept into the more of the 'non-main' but regular characters.
B008QTTGGG,frugalcrafter,5,I really enjoyed the characters and interactions in the story.  The story line is compelling and covers the private lives of the characters as well as good writing on the hunting of the Vessen.  The cliffhanger at the end of this season truly will keep you wanting to know what happens.
B008QTTGGG,Gerisa Y. Thompson,5,the first 2 episodes i saw of this in season one i thought were stupid. then i don't know what happened but it liked it. now i love it and can't wait for it to start again. some shows start strong then get dumb. this one went the other way.
B008QTTGGG,Gina,5,Love the creative story line! Very entertaining. The only thing I don't like is that it can be a little gory.
B008QTTGGG,Glenn,5,Grimm is a show that you don't want to miss an episode.  Amazon shows it without commercials.That makes it flow better.
B008QTTGGG,Grover D Carson,5,Just loved to watch the series from the beginning of season 1 and can't stop watching until I see the conclusion.
B008QTTGGG,Jack,4,It's sort of german mythical/fable mixed in with modern life mixed in superstition. Pure entertainment value and that's about it.
B008QTTGGG,Jaimison,5,Overall the story and progression have moved exceptionally well. Some parts I did not care for but overall the threads were woven together so well that I can leave things I did not like to the side of the road and enjoy the whole. looking forward to season 3.
B008QTTGGG,Jane E. Hauber "IMADiva",5,Great CastI like the basis for the story linesthe make-up for the creatures is fantastic and the change-overs is seamlessI love creepy storiesThe ending was REALLY a SHOCKERCan't wait for the next season
B008QTTGGG,JanR,5,Grimm has great personalities and terrific storylines.  The outlying Portland area really is shown to best advantage in these episodes.  Hope this one continues forever!
B008QTTGGG,Jason McNees,5,Great show.  I really enjoy it.  I watch with my gf.  Can't wait for season 3 to hit prime so we can watch it.
B008QTTGGG,jay,4,Solid storyline . Had a long break but now back picked back up where it left off. Defentley recomend watching . Enjoy
B008QTTGGG,Jenny,5,As the first season. I love the the show. It's so different and not the run of the mill shows
B008QTTGGG,Kari Hampton,5,My husband and I are addicted to this show! It is our guilty pleasure after long days at work. A hint of the X Files in the story lines but more fantasy world rather than scary or alien. You become emotionally attached to the characters and end up feeling like you're rooting for them. Highly recommend! Good for guys and girls but maybe not for younger kids as some of the scenes may look scary. Definitely a good one for twenty somethings.
B008QTTGGG,Kathryn M Guffey,5,I love the intrigue and mystery coupled with the fairytale aspect of this show. This is a great show with one of those story lines that will make you waiting and longing for the next show.
B008QTTGGG,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,I love Grimm.  I really miss it when the season is over and wish it was on all the time
B008QTTGGG,K.S. "Sunshine",5,TV show is very interesting to watch as that makes me tempt to watch more episodes. I hope there is another season 3 coming up soon...
B008QTTGGG,Lawrence Rivett Jr. "Elvis Mercury",5,My favorite show on TV right now. Glad I was able to view via Amazon Prime on a next day basis as I don't have live TV.
B008QTTGGG,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",5,It's wonderful to see new writing imagined with great new actors and their characters.  I love this show and look forward to each new episode.
B008QTTGGG,Lonnie N. Smith,4,The story is fleshing out more and the characters getting more believable as well. I am quite enjoying this series.
B008QTTGGG,luvsminis "mini horse lover",4,i really enjoyed this series. i hope it continues. the actors are very entertaining. one used to be on prison break.
B008QTTGGG,Mark Wolfe,4,They do a good job of suspending belief. If you have ever been to Portland ( and I was there for 10 years) they picked a great location for the story.
B008QTTGGG,Megan,5,Didn't think I would like this show but saw one episode in the middle of a season and it looked interesting enough. Once I started watching it from Season 1 I fell in love! Keeps you wanting more.
B008QTTGGG,Michael Dobey,5,Another fine episode in this hit shows second season.  The show remains a outstanding horror fest with strong characters and good effects. This episode features another good story line about the vesson and their various actions. I haven't seen a bad episode yet of this one and this has beat the odds because most horror shows fail on tv.
B008QTTGGG,Michael S. Jessop "Generalist",5,The progression of this show has been good.  From discovering who/what he is to the point he is at now has been a great journey and it has happened the way I wanted it to.  I knew from the beginning that the great tension they set up would have to be addressed and I've been waiting for it... and now it's here.  He has even begun to discover new &#34;abilities&#34; that I had wished for right along.  This is a show that feels like it is moving toward a purpose.The acting is good and the interactions have become progressively better and enjoyable.Good show.  Give it a shot.
B008QTTGGG,Michelle Polk,3,The battles and plot lines have gotten better. The acting is good.It is a very enjoyable show.So glad they got rid of that story announcer half way through the season! It was stupid.
B008QTTGGG,MickeyT "MickeyT",5,Grimm is an awesome series and I can't wait for season three to start this Friday! This has taken the old fairy tales and combined them with police action to create an awesome storyline with well developed characters. I just wish Mr. Grimm (David Giuntoli) would have dumped his girlfriend last season and replaced her with ME! LOL He is truly hot hot hot and really makes the series not only great but also very easy on the eyes.
B008QTTGGG,M. McCarty "hippy chick",5,I have been a fan since the beginning premiere.  It's interesting to see the key players develop and the &#34;beasts&#34; they come up with are creative.  Recommended it if you like dark fairy based stories.
B008QTTGGG,Money_Maker,4,I like this sorta wacky syfy type program a lil different but entertaining I thought I would just watch a episode but end up watching the whole series
B008QTTGGG,M. Penager "MP",5,Love this show!!!!!!!  Just enough reality to make it easy to suspend disbelief.  Great. Acting love special effects and fantasy aspect!!!
B008QTTGGG,Northerngal,5,I really enjoyed season 1 of Grimm and Season 2 is better yet!  Love the characters.  One of my favorite &#34;new&#34; shows.
B008QTTGGG,notwing,1,have not reviewed season  2 am only in season 1 3rd episode and am enjoying it very much at this time.
B008QTTGGG,Oldsoldier22 "Chief3lw",4,I don't really like gory horror so had my doubts about this show. After watching season 1 I was left with the need to see what was going to happen next to the goofball detective (who seems a little soft). Hollywood as it seems today is making men soft and very stupid with relationship with the opposite sex that it is taking away from what few good shows not reality on tv. In my opinion this show is worth viewing if you enjoy a tinge of horror and sci-fy.
B008QTTGGG,Patricia Doherty,5,I really warmed up to the show in the second season.  The first season was full of exposition that got a bit hard totake in at times.  Now that the show is setup it is much more fun.  The scripts had more of a flow and theCharacters were established.
B008QTTGGG,Paul M. Frasca "PMF",5,This is a well written show.  All the characters are very good no matter what circumstances they go through.  Every episode is full of entertainment.
B008QTTGGG,pennypincher,5,when fairytales require policework...this show just keeps getting better. the ensemble cast really makes this show fun as the story lines gel especially well and the show hits its stride as it discovers its own identity...
B008QTTGGG,red925,5,A unique show. I love the characters. I find it hard to stop at one or two shows at a sitting. A great fantasy!
B008QTTGGG,Rhonda L. Bennett,5,Very good Television Series. The graphics get better as the show progresses.  I am ready for more Grimm Season 3.
B008QTTGGG,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),5,The first season of this entertaining series introduced us to the various cast and their histories and agendas the second season gives us more on both the creatures of the Grimm Stories and the shadowy agenda that lurks in the background.  If you've seen Supernatural then this is another series to add to the collection as while there are obviously major differences with the stories and characters both are at the end exciting and entertaining to watch.
B008QTTGGG,Richard Pokallus,5,I'm a big fan of this show. Since I live in the NW & it take place in the NW. I don't know what else to tell you about the show but that it is a great show.
B008QTTGGG,R. L. Hearn,5,This has become one of my favorite shows since there are so few quality programs out there now. I'm glad that Nick is finally brining Nick into his realm of being a Grimm as well as Juliette.
B008QTTGGG,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I really like the series. The writing is still really good. I would recommend Grimm to anyone who is a fan of shows like Once Upon a Time. The show is one of my favorites.
B008QTTGGG,Rotatiller,5,Season 2 is just as good as season 1. Still full of action and fun moments! Same great characters! Interesting storylines! Huge cliffhanger on last one!! Love it! Anxious to be able to watch season 3 when it comes available for free!
B008QTTGGG,ROY,5,I'm awaiting this TV series Grimm S-2 so I cannot review something I have not received. Sorry but show me later after I get the series two.
B008QTTGGG,Sandee R. Lowe,4,THIS SERIES IS A GREAT SPIN ON THE FAIRY TALES I GREW UP WITH!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW...FOUR STARS FOR CREATIVITY!
B008QTTGGG,Scott Dyer,5,I really enjoy all of the subplots probably better than the larger story arc.  The characters are well developed and carry the story forward very well.
B008QTTGGG,Scott E. Bruneau,5,Reminds me of the old Night Stalker series of a long long time ago. Everything about it just CLICKS into place as fun and good. The humor of this series is great. I hope it stays on for a few more seasons.
B008QTTGGG,Sharon,4,It follows the idea of the Grimm Tales. Its fun to watch and keeps you interested in characters. I think its worth watching.
B008QTTGGG,SouthMO,3,Grimm is pretty entertaining.  It can be predictable but it is pretty good. The violence is too scary for pre-teen children.
B008QTTGGG,Steve,5,This is a very well done show. The pace is so well scripted and hope we see season 3 soon.
B008QTTGGG,Stray Matter Inc.,5,great series - Fun & entertaining - Just the right amount of adult theme makes the series a must watch
B008QTTGGG,Stuart Miller,5,I stumbled across Grimm through amazon prime instant video.  I started watching Season 1 episode 1 and before I knew it I was through Season 2.  It has some gory parts so be aware in case this bothers you.
B008QTTGGG,Susan Harris,5,Great series great cast. Always something new each week and now with the Grimm book of vessen and weapons it makes it even more interesting.  A Must Have Series.
B008QTTGGG,TaydeeBee,4,I've really enjoyed this show. It has a great story line and is different from most shows out there. I love the characters. I hope they put all of the seasons on prime
B008QTTGGG,taylor,5,Grimm is a good old fashioned set of fairy tales for adults. It is simply fun. You will enjoy Grimm.
B008QTTGGG,The Currdog,4,Grimm is very entertaining to those of us who still have an ability to live in our minds and then return to the mundane real world.
B008QTTGGG,The Librarian,5,The connection from season 1 to the opening of season 2 was fantastic and filled with anticipation. Really enjoy this show and the suspense building in season 2 is great... still watching it.
B008QTTGGG,Theresa Inziello "Tracy2.0",5,The show was well done it has a lot of Original ideas for fairytales. Special-effects are done so flawlessly that it's really difficult to even see them. This series get you away from the humdrum and it's very entertaining. Well-written well acted you can't go wrong.
B008QTTGGG,Tim,5,I love this show. The characters and the acting are very believable. The special effects are incredible. If you like the fantasy genre you will love this show.
B008QTTGGG,tin man,4,I love this show. The writers are keeping the story line going and I enjoy the team work in the show. My Daughter watched an episode with me one day and now is ahead of me in the number of shows watched.
B008QTTGGG,Tootsie,5,Love this show. I cant seem to get enough of it. I hope they never cancel it. Keeps me interested and wanting to watch the next episode one after another.
B008QTTGGG,Triciatx,5,Loved season 1 and couldn't wait to continue on with season 2.  It didn't disapoint. I recommend this series to any syfy watchers out there!!
B008QTTGGG,Victor1896 "movie addict",5,Great show.  Season two is a little more dark than the first year.  But I still enjoyed watching it and seeing the great make-up.
B008QTTGGG,WildflowerLady,5,Seems to have a lot of great content to show with each episode but the writers probably don't need to add any more new Wesson - expand in the ones already presented.
B008QTTGGG,WirebitersDotCom,5,I really like where they've taken the series. A few episodes can be a little hokey but overall most of the cast do an excellent job. I'm looking forward to the third season.
B008QTTGGG,Yvonne Michel,5,The characters speak to me in a way I didn't expect. Following their story and the way the themes are developed making this very pleasant entertainment.
B008QTTGGG,Z'Oma,5,Learned tove a  blubaut and all the other clever critter -people created for this series. The writing is well done and the major characters balance the crash-bang of the villains with genuine sweetness and relatedness. I loved the story lines in each episode. Great fun! Can't wait for the next season!
B008R6LI0U,dennis headley,1,Did they just stop updating this series? there are way more episodes to this season than are available here on Amazon.
B008S9CU7G,Tony,4,Great movie.  Better than most of the crappy &#34;zombie&#34; flicks/TV shows that have come out since 28 Days Later.  Thanks.
B008TCF7WW,Mary,5,I loved this series when it was on TV originally.  I am glad it was available on Amazon now.  My children liked it when it came out and both started looking for things in the library thanks to this show.  I wish that some station would remake the series.
B008V6Q2YS,Blanda Lynam,1,I really did not like this show at all.  I wanted to see what it was about and it really is about nothing.  I guess the money helps the family but the show is not interesting at all.  Like watching paint dry.
B008V6Q2YS,SaraG,4,I am fascinated by this show. So hokey and yet can't stop myself from watching. Keep asking are these people for real?
B008V6Q69Y,Stella Shahan "sastar27",3,i expected more from this movie i guess especially james franco from all the stuff i heard about him and all but no him playing a lawyer who should have been an artist and having a drug problem it was okay.
B008V6Q69Y,Thomas G. Boothe,2,I FELT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS VERY POORLY WRITTEN AND EXECUTED. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALL EYE CANDY AND NO SUBSTANCE.
B008V6Q69Y,THOMPSON,2,did not enjoy this movie. it was not what i expected it to be. maybe next time i will ask for information about it.
B008V6Q8G0,cherylannemarie,5,I love this show! Very real and Very scary. Not to be taken lightly for sure. I know if I viewed this as a kid and even after I would be very scared.  If you like paranormal shows I vote this one in the top 2...I guess top 1 right now for me.
B008V6Q8G0,jks1980,5,This is a terrific series on the syfy network! It's put together really well. I've seen all the seasons and it's a great reality tv show.
B008V6Q8G0,John C,5,If you love a good ghost story this is for you!  Lots of great stories of real people experiencing the paranormal!
B008V6Q8G0,Journey "Journey",5,This is a great series! If you are into ghosts or ghost stories you will love it. Even a skeptic may enjoy this once they hear the stories. They do a great job on reenactments & make sure you keep that &#34;spooked&#34; feeling. I don't scare easy....but I will admit there were a few times I made somebody else go get my laundry out of the washer.....in the basement lol. My daughter asks &#34;how do you even know they are telling the truth?&#34;. My reply is simple....&#34;watch a few&#34;.
B008V6Q8G0,readinglarge,5,As I have said before I watch all the paranormal shows I can but when I buy not one but two seasons it's proof it hooked me in but I loved every scary minute of it.
B008V6Q8G0,RiverRunner13 "River Runner",5,I love this show.  The stories are very well done.  A few are just down right scary.  My husband will not watch it - says it is too scary for him.  I think it is the best of the real life based ghost story shows out there right now.
B008V90WK0,gitaday "Gitaday",5,Whether you loved him in Friends or Studio on the Sunset strip or multiple movies don.t miss this new series.  He still is hilarious but has nuances of true Emmy greatness.  The series keeps you laughing but you are left with poignant feelings for the whole cast.
B008V90WK0,Ken Humphreys,3,About what you wouold expect from a politacly correct medioum talented churn it out style of writing.  Perry does do a good job with the script however.
B008V90WK0,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,We thoroughly enjoy this new show.  Michael Engler is great in the lead role.  Funny but serious in parts.  I thoroughly enjoy the acting and casting did a great job of choosing the main characters.  We always check out anything Michael Engler stars in.  We have yet to find a bad show with him in the starring role.  Highly recommended.
B008X0SGDC,Amazon Customer "Mermu",4,I liked this show more and more with each episode. The historical aspect provides challenges for the police unique to most cop shows. Cast is great and the story-telling is really good.
B008X0SGDC,BK Perea,5,Kept my interest from first movie thru to the end of the last. Good watching. Would definitely recomnend for others
B008X0SGDC,Brittany Thompson,5,I love how this show is so accurate in the events. Seems to take me right back to the 1800s. Lots of dirty words and women!!
B008X0SGDC,Carolyn D. Smith,4,I loved this series.  It has great characters.  Lots of plot twists and intrigue.  I highly recommend it if you like a good period piece.
B008X0SGDC,charles ackley,4,The show copper is very entertaining. And has a good plot to it would love to see 2nd season come on soon
B008X0SGDC,David W. Meadows,4,good story line/authentic characters realistic setting enjoy continued story line with individual crime solving and makes me want more seasons
B008X0SGDC,Donald E. Zlotnik "Novelist",2,The writer's went over-board justifying the angry black man. The plots were lose and poorly written. The characters weren't believable and I found myself drifting off watching the series to the point I stopped halfway through. Bad In every aspect.
B008X0SGDC,Douglas A. Ray "D_Ray",5,But now I AM hooked.  Recommended by a trusted friend so I stuck with it and am now completely into the characters.  Great post Civil War setting and an excellent character study.
B008X0SGDC,dulcibell "dulcibell",4,A very gritty part of New York's history makes for riveting watching. I recommend it to anyone who likes History and Mystery.
B008X0SGDC,Elisha C. Douglas,4,Love the story lines hate the cussing! can anyone make a show now without cussing. sheesh... hope corky can kick his habit and they make him a hero you can root for.
B008X0SGDC,greenapple,5,We loved the first season of this show so much that we couldn't wait for season 2.  The bad news is that a recent article said there will not be a third season.
B008X0SGDC,H.E.B.,4,The Canadians & Brits really know how to make a good series. Can't wait till next season is put on Amazon.
B008X0SGDC,Hodge Jones "Hodge",5,A raw show based on the history of NYC in 1864.  Reflects the biases and class tensions of the time as well as the corruption of the police force and politics.
B008X0SGDC,Ian Jamieson,5,Pretty good series. Crime detective with a taste of CSI but from the year 1865. I like the time period and hopefully some if not all of the things that occur are historically accurate and depict the &#34;way ff life&#34; that people endured back then.
B008X0SGDC,Inky,4,This show is well written and the characters are great. The story is a little rough at times but you have to consider the time line. I think men are more likely to like this show than women because of that.
B008X0SGDC,James A. Moore "Jim",5,I like the twists and turns. Five Corners is depicted very well. Someone did some real research when they put the sets and costumes together.
B008X0SGDC,Jamie,5,I enjoy watching full season series in rotation without advertising on Amazon Prime. This is impossible for me to do when watching weekly. This series is I believe very realistic over all excluding exterior views of buildings with only one chimney that is located opposite the kitchen or even better modern gutters and downspouts on buildings in 1865. These things don't affect the story but are fun to find.
B008X0SGDC,J. Morgan,5,Kind of violent but you see a lot of that sort of thing today on TV.Someone who can be mean when appropriate and caring too when all the shooting and stabbing is over.
B008X0SGDC,Joan Burton,5,I bought this series for my kids to watch over the holidays.  I already watched the first season and I loved it.  My kids are looking forward to seeing this series from BBC America.  I wasn't sure what to expect from BBC America but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was also impressed by the sets and the costumes.  I was afraid they would be cheap but I was wrong.  I highly recommend.
B008X0SGDC,Jolynn Raymond,2,We tried watching this show and it didn't pull either of us in at all. About 3/4 of the way through the first episode we agreed that this show wasn't something we were going to add to our Amazon Prime watchlist.
B008X0SGDC,Joseph B. Powell,4,Like the Characters and time period that it takes place in.  The Coppers pay attention to details used to help solve cases.
B008X0SGDC,Lilly D,1,I did not watch much of this as i felt it was not worth my time. Not a good choice.
B008X0SGDC,Mark Ackles,4,This TV series goes back in time to what it may been like in New York for an officer of the law. I enjoyed it so far.
B008X0SGDC,MaryAnn,5,I was surprised.  Ready for more.The costumes and scenery are seem very authentic.I am glad Amazon is creating the series.
B008X0SGDC,Melissa A. Martin "Wolf Soldier Girl!",5,I think this is a wonderful new show! I'm glad it comes on right after one of my favorite shows "Hell on Wheels". I think they did an awesome job with this new show and I hope it keeps running!
B008X0SGDC,mparrish,5,Excellent....Story lines are great.Can be intense at times.Try watching with no interruptions when viewing.Bring more Copper on....
B008X0SGDC,Scott,4,I really like the time period for which this show takes place and a look at what is was like for the general public back then (if you can believe them). It's an interesting time during the end of the civil war. The character development and mix is good for a first season show. I'm looking forward to watching season 2.
B008X0SGDC,shane molitor,5,When I found this series on Amazon Prime had to sit down and watch the series back to back for a couple days til I was done.
B008X0SGDC,Stephen,5,A fun romp through Civil War NYC--great fun. The cast fits well together and gives us an historical glimpse back 150 years.
B008X0SGDC,Steve,5,This is a great series set in 1860's New York at the time of the Civil War. The series centers on the character of an Irish immigrant policeman that has a fierce sense of what is right and wrong. It is full of intense scenes and captures the visceral sense of how violent and wild the country was at that time. It is a fabulous drama series that you don't won't to miss!  BBC has outdone themselves!
B008X0SGDC,Theodor Black "Theo Black",5,I'm loving this show.  It is not shot as well as Deadwood but the accents are correct unlike Deadwood who only kept the Chinese accent.  Anyway this show is gritty and dark and messed up just like it was.  The characters are complicated.  It is a great show that reminds me personally that the police in America were really started by the Irish.
B008X0SGDC,Victoria,5,Great new series from BBC.  I'm glad someone decided to finally make a show about post-Civil War America-this set in New York City...fantastic period and location for good drama.
B008X0SGDC,WednesdaySundae,2,Very bloody. um. Didnt get too far...in.. Might not have given it much of a chance I guess on reflection. It just was very .. bloody.
B008X0SSDU,Amazon Customer "Mermu",4,I'm getting more and more hooked on this show each season. Bohannon is one of the best Bad - Good Guys out there.
B008X0SSDU,Barbara G. Michonski,5,This is another of my favorite shows Anson is really good in this!! I hope it continues...... a a a a a a
B008X0SSDU,Brandon K Shatswell,4,Some interesting events in this season.  Not the best show in the world...but worth a watch if you're in between shows or something.
B008X0SSDU,broctune,4,This show seems to be channeling the spirit of Deadwood.While this show is not as good as deadwood it definitely tries to capture the spirit of a true to life old-timey western town.I would say that if you enjoyed the first season of Hell on Wheels you will definitely like this season as it is just as good.
B008X0SSDU,diannerae,5,I love westerns and this is a good series. I am sure I'll continue on with the series. I season 1 and 2 so I'll be on the lookout for 3. I also liked learning more about the building of the railroad since my ancestors were railroad men.
B008X0SSDU,Donna K. Ford "English Mystery Collector",5,The characters and story lure the viewer from the first show.  It is unlike any western I've ever watched and I'm notparticularly a western fan.  I'm very much looking forward to season 3!
B008X0SSDU,James A. Moore "Jim",5,I hate to see things end just as soon as I get into it. I didn't like the ending. You have to watch it to understand --- at least they didn't leave anything &#34;hanging.&#34;
B008X0SSDU,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,I am so glad to be able to watch my show on Amazon.com.  Thanks to DISH I can no longer watch AMC so I had thought I would miss this season.  I set up the auto purchase of the video on Amazon and am able to watch on my Laptop and it is great.
B008X0SSDU,Kyaruzi,5,It was as good as season 1 ecxcept i dont understand why it diverted attention away from the main story of the show. And Swede was like an evil Barney Fife.
B008X0SSDU,Lawrence Tuczynski "godzillamusic",5,I happened to stumble upon this show while browsing my In Demand because their was nothing on TV but reruns. I tried the first show of season 1 and was hooked and have watched every episode since. Looking forward to another season. Great characters.
B008X0SSDU,Lisa K. Sedlmeier,5,We tried this series on a whim and were glad we did.  Very engaging and entertaining.  We'll keep following this series going forward.  Good price too!
B008X0SSDU,Lisa M. Ludwig "booklover",5,Season 2 was fantastic. Can't wait for season 3. Love this series. Excellent acting by all great story. Season finale was ready good. This show is the best out there
B008X0SSDU,Michael B.,5,Shame that DISH doesn't carry AMC anymore since I have to buy my episodes to watch them but I'm a big fan of this show. I don't buy the HD as the feed going to my Playstation 3 isn't strong enough to support it but it's still very good on a HD TV. The characters are just as good as the 1st season. Love watching the time period that's being used and there's no holding back on the way things are expressed from that time in the United States. Another show from that period of interst is the BBC America show "Copper".
B008X0SSDU,millerj,5,I really really love this season of Hell on Wheels as much as the first season. I cannot wait to buy the third season.
B008X0SSDU,Ruth Grady,5,Good show and we hope they continue with many more seasons-we thought it was going to end after this one but we plan to order the next season we just enjoyed watching.
B008X0SSDU,Shirley M. Venente,5,Loved the Hell on Wheels series.  Personally for me it was a good representation of the good and bad involved in the growth of the American industrial era.  There were some pretty tough people back then!
B008X0SSDU,The Doctor,5,I have watched every episode released thus far and the series itself and the plots and acting are top quality.  You won't be disappointed.
B008X0SSDU,tootsie,5,Season 2 met and exceeded my expectations. There were some surprises and a lot of action. I am already anxious for season 3.
B008X0SSDU,Webster68,5,Outstanding show! All episodes are worth purchasing for all seasons if you have not kept up on this series. Beats watching shows with advertisements attached.
B008XFAE8M,Barbara J. Rudin,5,I love this show. The characters are all very rich and interesting. William Macy and Emmy Rossum are outstanding. You root for them at every turn.
B008XFAE8M,Jerry D. Mills,4,This give a very real look at what many faamilies in America are like..  It's both frightening and up-lifting.  Good
B008XFAE8M,M. Jenner "use the spell check",5,I adore this program. It took me a couple viewings to get into it and then it's just one big roller coaster ride. Way better than the English version in my humble opinion.
B008XFAE8M,thecoolcard,5,each season is better than the last. and season 2 is good. I watched it in about 2 days. I like it better that way so sit back and enjoy it
B008XFAE8M,William Gustafson,5,It is an additive series.  You have to watch just to see how low the family can sink and shake your head at the next act.
B008XFAZ2C,Gerbear,4,There is something about watching stupid or pompous people getting their behinds served to them.  I know it is perverted but I really do love it and Ramsey is a pro!
B008XFAZRW,Deanna Alpert,1,I've always enjoyed her as an actress and was surprised at her rendition of this detective who seems to have replaced Kyra Sedgwick in what seems to be a new rendition of &#34;Closer.&#34;  I cannot bear to watch her in this so I only watched the first episode.
B008XFAZRW,Deborah R. Painchaud "De Pa",5,I really liked the angst of this follow up series and was glad they stuck to the continuity with the characters. I enjoy crime drama and this series delivered for me.
B008XFAZRW,djdave,5,I had enjoyed the Closer. I have always liked Mary McDonnell. She did a great job in making the transition from antagonist to protagonist.
B008XFAZRW,Doreen Meyer,5,Never expected to like this mre than 'the closer' but find that it is both very different from and far better dramatically than its predecessor.  Mary McDonnell is fantastic: master of the soft slow speech that makes you listen...and watch.
B008XFAZRW,Five Yards,4,This version of the Major Crimes unit seems less adversarial; the writing more focused on how people get a job done. The cast is still marvelous and in some ways the individuals get to shine more. I like it. (I love Mary McDonnell!)
B008XFAZRW,gpat65,5,I have been watching Major Crimes on cable and enjoy it so much I  ordered the first season. I then found out Major Crimes was a continuation of a sort of The Closer so I went back and watched almost all of the seasons of that. Excellent show. Love the characters and the personalities of all the cops in the group . Super Show!!!
B008XFAZRW,Isabeau,2,This spin off from the Closer I had high hopes for but it left me longing for Kyra Sedgwick.  No one can replace her in this role.  I bought the entire season to try it out and ended up giving up after episode 5.  This series seemed to mostly revolve around Rusty.  The chemistry seemed dead and the magic was gone.  I wish I could get a refund.
B008XFAZRW,Kaydee,5,Since I have all the CLOSURE episodes--had followed Brenda's &#34;adventures&#34;--I wondered how the transition would work.It works.  The old CLOSURE crew has stepped up to take the lead in cases.  Mary McDonnell in her role has becomea facilitator AND incisive thinker.  We saw her in the past as a strong driving woman.  We now have been shown another sideof her--one softer and caring.  VERY nice!  I'm anxious to see more of Major Crimes.  The story lines remain strong andinteresting.
B008XFAZRW,L Daughtridge,5,Getting the first season and ordering the others as I can allows me to watch the series over and over. I have enough different seasons that I can swap with others and enjoy new and enjoyable entertainment. Always get good product and service from AMAZON!
B008XFAZRW,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",2,The same group without the Closer 'Brenda' I think lacks big time and falls flat. It's not nearly as fun or interesting as the Closer was. I really miss having Brenda in the series.
B008XFAZRW,Susan Harris,5,Well if we can no longer have The Closer at least we can have the cast with wonderful Mary McDonnell heading it up.  I am so glad that they changed the direction of her character from her first introduction.  It is a wonderful show.
B008XFAZRW,susan,5,the first season was great a spin off of the closers 7 seasons when brenda lee leaves the set and sharon takes over some of the favorites are still there and some of them are what holds it togather
B008XFAZRW,Tumbleweed,5,Kept the main cast. Brenda is not here but her husband is. Has a little bit of roughness when it comes to personalities clashing and people have to change their basic characters temporarily but all in all it is enjoyable.
B008XFBQNO,Geneva,5,It's a shame that there are so many addicts that there needs to be a reality show about them. I am forever ashamed at how self absorbed so many of them are!
B008XFBQNO,Jacob Crampton,4,It follows the same formula of the past 11 seasons and it works its entertaining but mit will soon drain the idea to the point of boring.
B008XFBQNO,Jacqueline A. Boyce "jack4102",5,This show was so good to truly see families and friends trying to save their loved ones and learning how addiction is so powerful it tears apart families and friends. The work they did on this show was awesome.  I will truly miss it.  Maybe they will do some follow up specials.More than worth my time.
B008XFBQNO,Lynn,4,This is a good program to see what drugs do to good people. Good for kids to see the bad effects of drugs before they are approached. Not suitable for really small children.
B008XFBQNO,nancy,5,Great show. Felt bad for the ones who did not take the help. Hoping the ones that did get help are still doing good.
B008XFBQNO,norma jean kringer,5,I had watched this program from the start and toward the end I was surprised that anyone needing an intervention didn't figure it out but the truth about what happens to FAMILIES is exactly what it is.  AND not all interventions work.  That was the honesty of the program.  Sorry to see it over.
B008XFBQNO,T. Buckner "cmc",4,It's a good show.  I never watch on tv but watch the prime time seasons offered.  It's realistic and teaches someone more about addiction and co dependency.  Also gives hope to families to see when someone gets help.  They look like night and day.  The transformation of someone clean is awesome to watch.  They need prime time seasons.
B008Y0I0HI,Amazon Customer,5,This was a great film! If you are looking to forget about your problems and laugh you a** off this is the movie for you! Fun fun fun fun ...
B008Y0I0HI,David Baldwin,2,This flick is simply pathetic.  It tries to channel the raunch of "The Hangover" movies with the female angst of "Bridesmaids" and fails at every turn.  I have nothing against the girls engaging in the kind of horseplay usually reserved for the boys but here it just comes off as juvenile.  It would help if there were some characters you can root for.  This flick attains the unthinkable by making Kirsten Dunst unlikable.  And her character works with pediatric cancer patients!  The usually reliable Isla Fisher comes off not as a smart person playing a dumb character but just plain stupid.  I guess if you were to point to any positives there's kind of a sweet turn by Rebel Wilson as the pleasantly plump bride-to-be.  If you're looking for a girls night out type flick skip this one entirely.  My wife who is less discriminating than me couldn't stand "Bachelorette" either.
B008Y0I0HI,GIA,5,This movie is AWESOME. A total chic flick.Isla Fisher's character is similar to the character she played in Wedding Crashers.I literally laughed so hard my stomach hurt.
B008Y0I0HI,KK,5,Laugh out loud many many times kind of funny. I've seen it several times since I rented it bc I need to have friends watch it. Man friends loved it too btw if u need to watch with hubbies or boyfriends. Btw it's available on netflix instant if u have it. If u don't it's totally worth the money to rent
B008Y0I0HI,Rodrigo Garay,3,There was some real talent in this movie but the writing and story telling just weren't there. &#34;Bride's Maids&#34; would be a better selection.
B008Y0I0HI,Rosa A. Fernandez,4,liked it  and it had its moments. it was a chick flick and it was reasonable to pay and watch at home since it was still in theaters. saved me the theater ticket price
B008Y0I0HI,Yar,5,Bitches are funny!The bachelorette was funny.The girls are jelly and the adventure is fool of dirty talk and drugs.
B008ZXSUO2,Amazon Customer,5,Here we see the writers following the story line started last year with the Doctor trying to make everyone think he's dead.  From the beginning of this one you can guess what is going to happen.  We know from the 'pre-quel' and everyone interviewed what is going to happen.  Here they begin laying the foundation.  No 'spoilers' here.  Watch and you won't be disappointed.
B008ZXSUO2,chai,5,My daughters love to watch Doctor Who. It is entertaining with clean humor and family friendly. They are looking forward to the new season coming soon.
B008ZXSUO2,Chris Schoenrock,5,This year is trying to top last year and they are exceeding. Each episode is excellent especially the farewell episode to Amy and Rory.
B008ZXSUO2,ColinMcKie,5,Even non-Dr Whovian's will love this one! Story is a bit of a tear jerker but it is well written and should scare the panties of the little ones!
B008ZXSUO2,Danielle Elizabeth,5,Matt Smith is my doctor.this season was amazing and helped me to learn to love heartbreak. Tears while smiling is what this season taught me.
B008ZXSUO2,D. Dalaney,5,I gave this  five stars due to &#34;The Angels Take Manahattan.  This was a most interesting episode and made the whole season worth watching.
B008ZXSUO2,D. Smith "Global Nomad",5,Doctor Who is great! I was not a fan at first but it sucks you in. Never thought a TV show could be so fascinating and aggravating at the same time!
B008ZXSUO2,E. Helms,3,Quote from the &#34;western&#34; themed episode: &#34;Anyone that is not an American put down your gun&#34;. I found it funny but this was a clear jab at us Americans. The effects are much better in this season and I really enjoyed most any episode with Daleks. Does have adult themes so not for younger kids.
B008ZXSUO2,Elliot Viker,5,Adventure and the realitys of true life come together with a dramatic end for the Ponds and the power of love.
B008ZXSUO2,Elrod,5,in it's original run it lost a lot because of the splitting the season intothi is the best way to watch
B008ZXSUO2,Jacqueline "ys diva",4,This season had it's pluses and minuses. The Ponds were given a perfect send off and the new companion is interesting. The Western episode has been done before but it was nice to see a parent accept the time travling and love it as much as the companions do.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B008ZXSUO2,J.B.G. "icr4trth",5,Didn't think anyone could top Amy Pond but Clara is a winner! Love the good-bye between River and the Doctor. Near broke my heart!
B008ZXSUO2,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,What is not to love a Tardis and dinosaurs and fun. Really well written. Enjoyed every episode so far. Waiting to see what's next. I do not mind paying for these episodes I find them worth the price.
B008ZXSUO2,J. Mitchell,5,I am a Dr Who fan from way back... like I use to watch when I was in my teens... late 60's with Tom Baker as the Doctor (last seen on Monarch of the Glen)... FX have improved greatly and I am in love with Amy Pond (a red-headed Scott)... I am waiting for Part 2 to be Prime!
B008ZXSUO2,John Boone,5,I have been watching Doctor who since the early 1970's and still enjoying each new episode of Doctor Who. Matt Smith adds character to the well known Doctor and is able to play his part well. I hope to continue to enjoy Doctor Who for many more years to come. When I am waiting for a new release of Doctor Who I may play some of the older original series. Both the old and the new series of Doctor Who are very entertaining and enjoyable to watch.
B008ZXSUO2,Joseph A. Saldano,5,As a person who grew up with Tom Baker as Dr. who I can honestly say that this is a great season. I only started watching the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series recently and Matt Smith has been excellent as the Doctor.
B008ZXSUO2,Julie Howard,5,loved the relationship between the 11th Doctor and Amy and Rory - what a great friendship. Last episode was sad!
B008ZXSUO2,sandy1,5,I am unable to get BBC network so was very excited to be able to pre-purchase this. I am a big fan. Even knowing what is to come (Amy and Rory) I eagerly await each email message stating a new episode is in my library. It's such a kick in the pants to see British TV shows recorded here in the USA. Really good to see Ben Browder in this episode. Enjoyable SciFi is hard to find with this level of humor.
B008ZXSUO2,sao,5,Just as good as the rest of the seasons. If you are a fan theis season will not let you down.
B008ZXSUO2,S. Gentry "irish rose",5,Matt Smith really shines this season as he seems to hit his stride. Fun episodes with the Daleks and weeping angels with some fun romps with dinosaurs in between.
B008ZXSUO2,Shortcake,5,The first and second part of season 7 are great and I can't wait to see the next ones made.
B008ZXSUO2,Stephanie Lynn Moore,5,Time travel has always fascinated me.  I love the plot and the countryside.I have watched this twice over.  Marvelous.
B008ZXSUO2,WednesdaySundae,4,Did not like this episode at first because it seemed all to predictable but it sure ended with a bang. :D Looking forward to seeing more like it.
B008ZXSUO2,Yar,5,Doctor who visits the dalek planet to save the dalek?Well the adventure continues.This ep has all the classic doctor feel
B008ZXSUO2,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,5,This show just gets better and better.  The entire family loves Doctor Who just as I did twenty years ago.  Rock on BBC!!
B008ZXSW2C,2510cheesecake,5,I wasn't sure I would like this show but I haven't stopped laughing and watched the entire season in one day! Totally charming and fresh! The actors are great and super funny!
B008ZXSW2C,Anne Lee,1,The Mindy Project is a "comedy" I don't find it funny when a successful doctor acts like an insecurity teenager.  "Mindy" may have graduated medical school and practices medicine but is a "project" because she isn't in a relationship. This show sends a horrible message to young women.
B008ZXSW2C,June,4,It's refreshing and great. I like the characters. Mindy is really the star of the show and is very talented.
B008ZXSW2C,Kindle Customer "Amazon Devotee",5,I find I can't stop laughing when I watch this. I particularly like watching it late at night as the end of each episode reminds me it's time to turn out the lights. Not that I always pay attention...
B008ZXSW2C,LLB52,5,Love this show!  We had to get a new DVR and lost 5 episodes we missed.  We finally found them on Amazon.
B008ZXSW2C,M. Wiren "mw",5,Can't wait for Season 2.  Seriously.....can't wait.  All the characters are funny and the writing is smart.  I laugh out loud regularly.
B008ZXT2LM,Amber R Burkhart,5,I got this for my daughter when she was 2 months old. She is now 5 months and in love with Dinosaur Train. :) Thanks I love the educational knowledge.
B008ZXT2LM,Christa Douglas,5,Dinosaur Train is such a great show and my 2 yr olds love it. The characters are friendly and loveable which makes the kids pay attention. Their adventures are always fun and they learn a little about dinosaurs along they way!!
B008ZXT2LM,Dr. in Pasadena,5,I love how much my daughter and family learn about different prehistoric creatures!  That's not the only skills we learn that are modeled for us on the show.  I love that the family dynamics model common challenging situations and helpful solutions that can be applied in my family.  The show is also colorful and simply lovely to watch.  This is one of my favorite PBS shows.  Enjoy!
B00905RRNE,Chuck St. Louis "The Saint",5,Good Show. Good Learning experience. What these people endure to find gold is unbelievable. There is one barge with an excavator mounted on the bow and this scoops up some serious dirt containing some serious gold. Hundreds of ounces.
B00905RRNE,Roger,4,These people take some very high risks just on the hope of striking it rich. I think I'd rather get a job at McDonald's than put up with the risks and freezing weather.
B0090EJZA8,Dellamae "dellamae",1,It was not what I expected and narration was boring. I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over.
B0090EJZA8,Lulu Moretti,5,If you love film and film makers and ever dreamed of a time when you could sit down with Lucas or Cameron or Fincher or Scorcese here's your chance. The issue under discussion? The move from film to digital. The analysis? Priceless.
B0090X4IYW,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",3,A classic story of passion gone wrong. It is hard to feel sympathy for a mother who abandoned her child to 'live in sin'. On the other hand one is filled with distaste for the  hypocrisy of the society that she lives in.
B0090X4IYW,grant18,4,One of my favorite novels but one that seemingly can't be compressed into a movie.  This try collapses the ending beyond reasonable bounds.  But my biggest issue is that I just couldn't identify this Anna with the Annas of Greta Garbo or Vivian Leigh & the Vronsky was even less my ideal of a dashing soldier-of-fortune.
B0090X4IYW,Micky,1,Contrived chemistryContained cinematographyConcealed ActingWhere's the Epic?A waste of time ... why are there so many versions of this classic - no one gets it right?
B0090XDE2Y,C. conway,5,This show is a great watch !! I normally don't like reality tv but Face Off just sucked me in !! The imagination people shoe in practical effects is absolutely AWSOME !!!
B0090XDE2Y,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,This is another wonderful season of Face Off. There isn't a lot of drama with having the 'wrong' contestant stick around far longer than needed. It's stellar season.
B0090XDE2Y,Lisa M Wiley,5,This is a really fun show.  I have never had a huge interest in sci-fi shows but this show has made me a fan.
B0091P60PY,Amazon Customer,4,I heard the movie was go and they were right. It was a solid story. The plot was predictable but not a hindrance to enjoying the movie. The acting was solid from all participants. Decent special effects that were not heavy handed. Give it a try.
B0091P60PY,Barbara E. Blanco,3,Not quite sure how to explain my rating of this film but it was an okay movie on a rainy day. Lots of blood and gore so hide the kiddos. I covered my dogs eyes hahaha!
B0091P60PY,bbrockRailFan "Brian Brocksmith",4,Although not a cinematic classic I felt it was entertaining. It was gritty and well done. The sets where realistic and for a lower budget movie the acting and effects where pretty good.
B0091P60PY,christopher driggers "Crowdancer",2,the plot was ridiculous and the story line was over all very very slow  its pace was sleepy and i lost interest after the first 20 minutes the story line is very very predictable girl get kidnapped girl gets rescued bla bla bla  dont waste your money
B0091P60PY,C. Van Blake,4,Sword and sorcery flick where the good guy is a former bad guy trying to make things right.  Violence and a lot of hand combat.  Visually rich and entertaining if you like the "dark knight" kind of film. Teens and older. Not recommended for young children.
B0091P60PY,Danny L. Abernathy,4,never read the booksnever heard of this hero! beforemight we privvy to some morelets keep this one around
B0091P60PY,FUBAR-EOD,5,Great mix of Middle Ages life with more reasonable science fiction magic inclusions.  Provides insight to life outside the walled cities and earlier magic/religion traditions.  I'm a senior citizen and my 26 year old son both watched this and really liked the movie enough to watch it again.
B0091P60PY,Ian Jamieson,5,I gave this movie 5 stars because it was very enjoyable and not your &#34;run of the mill&#34; story line.  I wasn't expecting what I saw and when that happens I tend to enjoy the movie much more.  When it is made available for purchase I will be buying it as I feel it has re playability.
B0091P60PY,inspectorudy,4,A good story of evil and then revenge that will make you feel satisfied. A bit of fantasy and supernatural mumbo jumbo but a fun popcorn eating movie.
B0091P60PY,Lynn McBee,3,Movie was good for an action flic. Acting was ok. Nothing sparked but would have liked more scenes where Purefoy was involved in aggressive fighting.
B0091P60PY,my name is nobody,4,It's a pretty good movie but I don't understand why it's not available in the U.S. on dvd. James Purfoy does a good job playing Soloman Kane.  It's a good adaptation of the classic story.
B0091P60PY,Nicholas M. Zallas "Greek Scholar",3,An interesting movie but very dark.  I watched it once and decided I probably wouldn't watch it again.  I donated it to my local library.
B0091P60PY,sharon,4,If you like swords and magic this movie is for you! Acting is pretty good and so is the direction!
B0091P6X2E,Danny L. Abernathy,4,actually a trailerwas a good couple minutes but when will it be in the theatresdeserves to be seen on the big screen
B0092ME70Q,leo clark "bob",4,entertaining series about the rugged and rough wilderness lifein the far north. should be priced lower or be on prime. but itis interesting. these people are living like the pioneers.
B00932ADLC,Brenda Santiago,5,I could not stop watching... the young actresses were super!!! there dancing to die for!!! and to see some of the cast from Gilmore Girls was great since they are great with their wit!!!!
B00932ADLC,B. Smith,5,Characters are diverse and dance is entertaining. Who would know that a series centered around ballet could be so addicting?
B00932ADLC,Cathy,5,I did not think I would like it much but ended up loving it! Wish there were more seasons available!
B00932ADLC,Dg,5,Bunheads is one of those few shows that separated itself frommany teen shows on ABCfamily where it had fast unique dialogue and just outrightfun comedy. And sadly a diamond in the rough that only a few could seeits potential. With that in mind I recommend to any teenage girl or womanto go and give it a shot. Not many I know have gotten into it but you do &#34;Awesome!&#34;if not &#34;Well you tried&#34;.Hope this help!Good Luck!
B00932ADLC,Don Montgomery,5,The premise of this series is very touching and it carries well into the episodes. The acceptance of all &#34;body types&#34; and the valuing of individual gifts is very refreshing.
B00932ADLC,I. McKinzie,5,Was a different kind of humor and I guess some people didn't understand it ... but I did and it was refreshing.  Love how the kids loved the one teacher who was having a hard time &#34;finding herself&#34; ... I really liked her myself ... and helped her alot as she helped them ... sorry to see the series end and not be picked up for further stories ... I was looking forward to it continuing.
B00932ADLC,Jacqueline A. Boyce "jack4102",5,OKAY I'M HOOKED.  ARE THERE NO MORE EPISODES? LOVE THE DANCING AND CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE CAST.  I EVEN LOVED THE OLD SCHOL MUSIC THAT WAS USED.  PLEASE TELL ME THERE WILL BE MORE!!!!
B00932ADLC,John J. Schubert "Schubej",3,Watched on the strength of its creator who was responsible for The Gilmore Girls which I thought was exceptional.  The same witty comments are heard but not delivered with same brilliance as the cast from The Gilmore Girls.  The initial premise was thin (a showgirl in Las Vegas is wooed into marrying a mundane man who actually still lives with his mother - Kelly Bishop who was Lauren Graham' s mother in The Gilmore Girls).  The showgirl inherits her husband's property when he dies only two days following the wedding.  She also inherits the studio where the mother teaches dance to a group of teenagers (the bun heads).  It is interesting enough to keep watching (seen only a few episodes so far) but hope for improvement from the cast overall.
B00932ADLC,KMC,5,This is a great show. I love the stories because of all the drama the girls go through and how the young ballet teacher can't help herself but too get involved in to their lives while trying to work through her own issues.
B00932ADLC,Knight68 "EM",4,The series is terrific and the best part it is free.  Free-that is-until near the end of the season then we are asked to pay 1.99 per episode.  Which may not be too bad if we hadn't paid 79.00 for the Amazon Prime.  For 6.00 more one can join Netflix and see everything Prime has and more.  Back to the series it is great.
B00932ADLC,Lorena M,5,This Show Is very good am hooked i already bought 3 Episodes and going to buy 2 more Later i like How Suttonr Foster Acts And she is so Pretty with or without Makeup
B00932ADLC,loveinthemist,3,this is for either teenagers or adult women kind of show. I doubt most men would enjoy it. It is okay nothing great.
B00932ADLC,MrHarleyDavidson,4,This show about the struggles (comedic) of a dance studio and it's owners in a small beach community in CA is great. Well written and excellently performed - well worth watching.
B00932ADLC,Ms. Beatriz O. Resendez,5,This is one of these shows that I want to see more of!!!!!!!!! Not reality these are so much way better than the show on now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00932ADLC,OKCOK,5,Lovers of Gilmore Girls no longer need despair!  A series from Amy Sherman-Paladino has arrived with the same quirky kind of characters and fast paced dialogue that won the hearts of fans for many seasons.
B00932ADLC,Philip Logiudice,5,This is a great show. The case are all very talented. The scripts are very interesting and a lot of fun.
B00932ADLC,sao,4,I wasnot sure if I would like this show but after a few shows I started to really like it . It is a great no thought required show.
B00932ADLC,the Commish!!!,5,my only wish is that it cancelled after one season.my daughter is the one who watched and was angry when she found that out
B0093QLGO6,B. Merrill,5,This is a hartwarming show with issues of today. Its a funny family comedy it will make you laugh with a storyline or message to evey show.
B0093QLGO6,Nh granite,5,I love this show.  I think the character that Ellen Barkin plays is hilarious and the one liners are fast and furious so pay attention.
B0093QLGO6,R.R.H.,3,Thought I was going to love it but it's just okay. It's like a cross of Modern Family and Raising Hope but not as quirky or as funny as either one.
B00944CJRK,M. J. Perrone Jr.,1,I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar.  House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially.  His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid.  The remainder of them were straight up craptastic.  I paid $8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out.  I actually turned it off before finishing it.  I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $0.  My friend bought it (he is bummed by the mistake) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something...nope...hated it!
B0095DFUF8,Laura Miller "LauraM",4,I really enjoyed the show for the tongue & cheek it was --- seen so many people trying to determine if it was real or not :LOL: -- who cares it is TV and even reality TV is all real -- it is about ratings and dollars and entertainment folks ---
B0095DFUF8,w.Biedermann,3,I work with several Amish communities and not sure how legite this is.  I hope that those who don't know the Amish don't get crazy ideas about their culture.
B0095IDWG2,ablatt123,5,Amazing knowledge and would recommend this series to all my friends!!!  It keeps me chomping at the bit for more!!
B0095IDWG2,CatLoraine,5,I love this series so much I have seen the entire 64 episodes twice already and am seeing it again for the third time.It is easy to watch and to understand.
B0095IDWG2,D. Molder "D. Molder",5,I like to explore the knowledge that is available from many sources. This series brings most of that knowledge to the forefront. All the theories and combines them to make a picture of what we suspect to be real. You will see as you progress through the episodes how much our science has changed in just the seasons this series has been on. They have a way of presenting the information to where it is interesting and engulfing. This series will keep you interested if you are into the science.
B0095IDWG2,Ixias,5,Great show. A lot of fun facts about astronomy. Fine for children. Illustrated with animation to keep their attention.
B0095IDWG2,Jerry Fletcher,4,Wanted something interesting enough for an old adult like me to watch and also basic enough to hold the attention of a younger kid (9).  This was both.  I'd prefer it were free though since its a PBS/Discovery Channel-type program originally.  I wouldn't pay for the whole series personally.
B0095IDWG2,Larry Parker,5,Shows that are well produced like this one make learning about our neighborhood fun. Enough topics were covered  to bring the system we live in to focus.
B0095IDWG2,Yvonne Michel,5,I haven't been disappointed yet with this series. Wonderful scientists with a great ability to bring the information into our reality.
B0095R3ES4,Aaron Sewell,3,Great show but it needs Micheal Scott to be the center of the cast. Wish Steve Carrell could have made a few guest appearances.
B0095R3ES4,Dakota J. Doerr,5,the office is a hilarious show that will forever be part of tv history all the characters are great and im sad to see it go but it had a good run i definitely reccomend
B0095R3ES4,Erik Therme (author of Mortom),4,The Office (as a whole) was an amazing show. It lagged near the end (as most shows do) but Season 9 came back solid and delivered the goods!
B0095R3ES4,liesel strong,4,i still love the office. i was afraid that things would go down hill after michael left but it is still just as entertaining as ever even though i still don't like spaders character.
B0095R3ES4,Lynn McBee,5,What a great ending to one of my favorite comedies. I enjoyed the way everything was wrapped up. I also enjoyed seeing Steve Carrell back at the end. Left me laughing and feeling very warm & cuddly.
B0095R3J8O,Amber R Burkhart,5,My favorite TV show to date. :) Can't wait to see many more seasons of this show.  Good for the whole family
B0095R3J8O,Ashley Thomas,5,This show is so inspiring! I just can't get enough. My husband loves it too! Characters deal with real life situations and I makes it rewarding to watch.
B0095R3J8O,Brenda Santiago,5,I love the stories so far this season... and it just seems they play their characters true to the story that I just began to watch this season and have cried thru each episode...
B0095R3J8O,Daphne,5,This show is awesome gives you a real life look into life with a child that has autism and how an extended family copes 5 star rating
B0095R3J8O,gitaday "Gitaday",5,I watch many series and feel Parenthood to be the only one that shows a real multi generational family in the truest sense.
B0095R3J8O,Katycaboose "Katty",5,So sorry can't view season 5.  Am hanging out ona limb until it is available guessing what happens from the one sentencewritten about each epsode.  Wonderful family program.Always interesting.  Great script anf exelent acting feel like they are my family.
B0095R3J8O,Meggan "Meggan",5,This show could go on forever and I would continue watching. Great cast and story line all around great show.
B0095R3J8O,Mike Dougherty,5,Love/hate the cast. It does do a really good job of making you care for the characters. Alot of sad moments but ALOT of really happy ones as well.
B0095R3J8O,MM,5,This is a wonderful show. So much reality and insight into family and the struggles and love theyhave for each other. All families should watch this together.
B0095R3J8O,Nuttya22,5,This episode will make you cry.  I loved it.  I love the Bravermans.  I feel like they are a part of my family!!!
B0095R53M4,Aaron Sewell,5,My wife and I love this show. All the characters carry their own weight and its hard to pick a favorite.
B0095R53M4,Amazon Customer,5,This was hilarious! Love the Jerry moments.. They always make me laugh! Hope they do another one of these because there's already been some more great moments in the new season
B0095R53M4,Amazonian,5,Perfect cast and great writing. A mix of sitcom and SNL skits. I love this show! Every season so far.
B0095R53M4,C. J. Vazquez,5,A great series just gets better. There's more character development. Anne and Chris take it to the next level. Funny episodes all around.
B0095R53M4,Deborah R. Painchaud "De Pa",5,All these characters are well scripted and unforgettable...we watch it again and again ...we are huge fans and want more
B0095R53M4,dman,5,Hard to believe it has been 5 years or seasons!! The show gets better and better. It is never stale. It continues to have little twists and turns and then something new and keeps you on your toes.New characters fit right in. Subplots continue and gains your interest then stop and the main plot continues.Like the hole behind  a certain someone's house.
B0095R53M4,Ellen Ellis,5,Clever writing. Exellent cast. The only sitcom currently on air in which every cast member is outstanding. The casting director should win an Emmy!
B0095R53M4,PJ,4,Another great season. Loved the Biden cameo. The season seemed a little less focused than other seasons but still very enjoyable. Finished the whole season in a hurry!
B0095R53M4,R.R.H.,5,Love this show! Every single person in the cast is hilarious and impeccably cast. The writing never gets old. Hope they keep going.
B0095R53M4,Terri,5,I LOVE this show! The more I watch it the better I like it. This show is so laugh out loud funny!
B0095R53M4,victoria,5,We have seen 4 seasons of Park and Recreation  and it is so addictive because you soon become a part of these peoples lives and you can't wait for the next episode.
B009651C9S,CEPeters,5,My daughter LOVES Doc!  Cute stories that come with small peoples' life lessons and we enjoy watching it with her.
B009651C9S,Crusader Rabbit "HeadInTheClouds",5,It's a very sweet show.  my 4.5 year old daughter loves it.  It's a great show that teaches about having empathy.
B009651C9S,PDJ,4,this is a cute cartoon where her stuffed animals become alive. Good stories and fun cartoon by Disney. Would recommend
B009651C9S,Stephanie Pass "tiptoefairy",5,Doc McStuffins is one of our favorite shows.  My preschooler loves it.  I was so sad to see that it's not available on amazon instant video anymore.
B009651C9S,Tiana Kennemur,5,My children love this cartoon!  And I love how they take care of their toys and animals now with check-ups and good advice.  They have also decided that they don't want to eat foods with sugar because Doc said they need to eat more fruits and vegetables.  Just adorable!
B00978LMCG,Michael "beergut",1,this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever."Dumb" is too smart for this movie!This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie!I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that's how stupid this movie is!80% of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever! IT MADE NO SENSE!  nothing was even remotely realistic or logical!If this was a film about how to make the worst decisions ever while being hunted by a murderer- then it's the best movie ever! lolThis movie was so bad it's hard to give examples- I'm so sorry.I will never watch a movie by this director ever again.I'm sorry that I sound like a broken record... it's just I can't believe how gawd awful this film was!
B00978LMCG,specialkrp,1,This movie was horrible. If you are a fan of horror films skip it brcause you are noy missing much.
B00978M72U,Arish "A+",4,Cons 1stNot bad but not revolutionary either but a good character study. I thought that with her androgynous appearance she would have played on that more. With the look that they gave her and all the efforts put into it i felt it was pointless. Too me it seems like she was somewhat totally unaware of what was going on. Not sure what the director was trying to do with the film or the character. It was hard to really determine if she was a manipulator or just plain naive. Then the wife was supposedly attracted to her and everyone else in the house. But nothing really transpired which was a complete let down. I hate movies that suggest things but don't act upon them. If you want to see a film similar to this but a little more straight forward try 'Albatross". Overall I think with OLivia Thirby's beauty I think they could have pushed things a little more. I think she was better in "THE WACKNESS" as far as her demeanor was concerned.Pros:Overall though the movie was somewhat interesting if you deal with these situations on a day to day basis. I can definitely understand how men and women or children could have a unexplained attraction to a individual. The film strongly suggest this in a very calm way. It also points out how someone can be judged just by appearance like myself for instance. Just because you may be artistic and you express your self in your appearance doesn't always suggest these things. Martine was clearly a very stylish and stunningly attractive androgynous character in the film. So the attraction that most had to her was quite understandable. The scene with the little boy and the swimming pool I thought was pretty accurate. I really appreciate the writer showing this and being bold enough to put that out there. There is one other film that suggest this called "Hesher" with Natalie Portman. I truly do believe that children have these emotions even though they are premature and innocent. Overall I thought this was a good movie very different but I just thought it could have been executed better. But the type of person Martine was is rarely talked about in films. They didn't go for the stereotypical blonde which I greatly appreciate. I can truly identify with this character completely because I am artsy and androgynous individual myself. And because of this I get misunderstood all the time and misjudged all the time. The scene where she was walking through the city was really a nice scene.Over all 4 stars because I think they had a lot of ideas and material to work with here. But they just didn't take it as far as it could have been taken. This could have been an amazing drama... one of a kind actually. It could have been better than Poison Ivy or any of those. Not so much  that they had to make her a bad person or a villain? I just think some of the things that transpired could have been shown in detail and had more of a edge too it. But over all for me it was a satisfying entry.
B00978SIJ6,Day Fan,5,I enjoy watching Jennifer Garner most times.  In this movie I found her to be a real B.... to this little girl.  She did a really good job of it.
B00978SIJ6,Decoratin4Fun!,1,Seven dollars to rent a movie?  You could buy a DVD for $7 easily.  This is a rip off.  I watched this movie but found it horrible because the price was so high.
B00978SIJ6,Eric W. Hutcheson "guyseattle",2,The story is kind of lame and I lost interest halfway through. The story also does not makes much sense. Skip it!
B00978SIJ6,mr. contrarian,4,I know...another silly parody of obsessive midwesterners with the quirk factor turned up to 11?  Yes and no.  There is genuine humor to be found here and some unexpected drama.  I wonder if I'm the only viewer that detected shades of the 2008 Hillary versus Obama showdown?  At least the long term goal in this story was to be recognized as the best butter carver rather than tyranny by massive government debts.
B00978SIJ6,Patricia Appelquist,4,Could you imagine Jennifer's life she keeps getting pregnant and has to deal with Ben Affleck and his non political political campaigning plus she has to cook for Matt Damon and his brood every Sunday night because you know they all get together for Sunday Night Dinner and well I would do this film too just to get away from all that.
B0098G756O,Jane,5,Not high drama but a load of fun and laughs.  It's worth watching just to see &#34;Jax&#34; as a regular guy.
B0098G756O,KK,4,Pretty ridiculous but ultimately I laughed out loud quite a few times. It's not a thinker but very enjoyable. I'd definitely watch it again. Chris ODowd is so so funny and Charlie Hunnam was great. I genuinely felt bad for his character. So what if some of the plot points were completely unlikely to happen in real life!
B0098G756O,Mark Ament "M. Ament",4,Very funny in its own offbeat way. We enjoyed it far more than we expected. Weren't too sure what to expect since no one in the group had heard of it but turned out to be very enjoyable. Recommend it.
B0098G756O,Melissa,4,Me and my daughter really enjoyed this-lotsa laughs! Wished the extras included outtakes...bummer. But the cuts were good...one great decision the director (kudos Jordan Roberts) made was replacing Ron Perlman for the mother in the last phone call scene...not only did it add to the "love story" bit...but it added to the "evening with Phillis" - made it look as though they "became close" enough to have a conversation on relationships....hilarious! Loved it!
B0098G756O,pops95b,1,This show was two hours of my life that i will never get back. I kept watching thinking that surly the main character would grow a spine and kick his abusive toxic family to the side..but no! He just keeps coming back for more with that sad puppy look in his eye. I found myself yelling insults at his family for him. I would steer clear of this one.
B0098G756O,suzatm,1,This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen  and I very much regret spending the money for it. I had high hopes for it because of the actors involved but we stopped watching because of how totally stupid it was.  It was a total waste of money and time.  It was just unbelievably bad.
B0098VV4NE,Bookworm936,4,The movie was alot like Lake Eden except Lake Eden was a bit more "shocking" since the people tormenting were young (although I did prefer the movie Them).  The plot is very simple...a group of women go camping and end up terrorized.  The movie does try to give an element of surprise that the killer could be one person...ahh but maybe not?? But the surprise element wasn't very surprising but at least it tried.  It would have been nice to have seen more of a struggle with the boyfriend but it is what it is and it kept me entertained while at work.  I would like to see a movie where the victim goes for help as opposed to going back and trying to save her friend(s) but I guess if that happened there wouldn't be much of a movie.  At least the girl(s) did put up a fight which is commendable as opposed to the running and tripping over a branch and laying there screaming until killed.I do think the movie was well made.  The viewer could see what was going on.  I never thought that was a big issue until I came across some movies that were so darkly lit where it was difficult to tell what was going on.  The pacing was descent and the actors did a good job.
B0098VV4NE,violet rose,3,good solid movie.....typical storyline but i still enjoyed it.....nice thrill ride at the end of the movie...who will survive...who wont & what happens to the sole survivor.......good watch..............nice ending..........and it does make you wonder what can happen when u go hiking.....not that this will really happen but u never know - makes ur mind wonder....oh my :)
B0098VVOGG,Ann,3,Feel sad for these people and their obsession but very happy they receive some much needed help.  Kinda hard for me to watch.
B0098VVOGG,barbie "doggy mom",5,I really enjoy watching hoarders. Most of the people have a problem others are just lazy! Either way it makes me want to get up and clean my house.. Ha Ha!
B0098VVOGG,Beverly Morten,5,This show made me get to work and keep my house in order. I did not know that it is a sickness when you hoard. I enjoyed watching the program thanks again
B0098VVOGG,Brenda D. Nelson,2,Hard for me to watch.  I view it when I need motivation to clean my own house and throw stuff out.  How can anyone care so much about &#8220;stuff?&#8221;  They put &#8220;things&#8221; over people and that is the most disturbing part.
B0098VVOGG,Cat Woman Returns "Kitty",5,This helps me finish my projects and clean..... ewwwwwI can still see my floor and I have a clean kitchen (basically).  I would get more done if I could just stop watching hoarders
B0098VVOGG,DD "DD",3,To make a series out of people with this condition is repetitive. It gets quite tiring to watch this show which almost makes fun out of people who have this condition.A Special about this condition with helpful hints to the &#34;hoarders' and their families may have been better.
B0098VVOGG,Elle Leslie "Knowledge Is Power",5,As good as the rest of the Hoarders seasons.  Prepare yourself for the lady that &#34;freezes&#34; her dead cats (yuck!)
B0098VVOGG,Jean Phoenix,3,This is not very interesting unless you have nothing else better to do and are bored out of your mind by other programming. I guess it could be something you'd do on Saturday night with a beer in your hand and a spouse who's snoring in his chair next to you!?!
B0098VVOGG,joan,5,Great show.  I enjoy watching this show  Never realized how many hoarders there actually are and how difficult it is for them to get rid of junk!
B0098VVOGG,Linda S "readinglife",3,It's a good show and you learn about this psychological disease that affect so many people. But the show can be slow and not as compelling: Needs edited down.
B0098VVOGG,Melissa,3,just crazy some of these people living like that its horrible and sad but it is a sickness and I feel bad that some of these people and need help but cant get it.
B0098VVOGG,Robert Bowen,5,Love to watch.  Always want to get rid of things after watching.  Definitely something that keeps my interest and will watch again and again.
B0098VVOGG,ruthieo54,4,I am not a big fan of reality shows but Hoarders has been an exception in my viewing choices. My family called it &#34;Packrat Syndrome&#34; and didn't like to admit the tendency many of us had (and still have). I feel that I am in the process of helping myself avoid disaster by watching this show and trying to relate and learn. The professionals who come in to help these families and people who are afflicted are very informative and helpful - even in a show where the person cannot really improve much at all. I say this because the syndrome or illness does not get cured in one episode... you find out by the notations that some people get better and some don't. It shows how hard it is to deal with Hoarding at all - but dealing with it is a necessary tribulation for anything good to happen.I have learned a lot and changed some of my behaviors for the better as a result of watching this show. Thanks.
B0098VVOGG,Tracy Christensen,5,There is nothing more motivating than watching a few episodes of hoarders to get one in the mood to clean house!  Love this show always makes me feel like the place I am able to provide for my daughters is an absolute palace.  I  pity these people that they live years this way without family stepping in sooner.
B0098VVOGG,Val,1,If you are extremely bored this is the show for you. People like this should be sent to a mental institution
B0099JKR6U,A. Fast,5,Love watching without the hundreds of commercials that accompany the weekly show.Love the show and all the complex characters and plots.
B0099JKR6U,Amazon Customer,5,continues the Samcro saga into wonderful tragedy and violence all seemingly to keep the family safe and sound from harms way...
B0099JKR6U,Amazon Customer "Mermu",5,I got hooked on this show through Amazon Prime and now I'm jonesing for the next season. I love the Hamlet-esque structure of the story as well as all of the tweaks and changes the writer has made to make it relevant to a bike club.This show is both high and low brow.
B0099JKR6U,Barbara G. Michonski,5,This is a great show and every season it gets better. Can not wait for Season 6 to start this Tuesday!
B0099JKR6U,Barb in Savannah,5,We loved this season!  Now we are in for a long wait to follow Jax and the gang.  I like the relationship between Katie and Jimmy
B0099JKR6U,BeckyBWVU,5,Started watching this show about a month ago after hearing so much about it and it definitely lives up to all the hype.  The cast and writing are nothing short of amazing.  This is probably the best tv show I've ever watched.  Can't wait for season 6!
B0099JKR6U,Bevvie,5,It's a good story ... People getting kill all the time the young pres....try's to make the club go straight .....time is against him and the forces that be.....I really like it...
B0099JKR6U,Bill K,2,Been a fan of this series for four seasons.. Understand the desire for writers to push the envelope however this time S5 episode 1 crossed the line. For me anyway. Afraid I am done with the series. Could have accomplished the same plot line and emotional impact without exposing the audience to such graphic and obscene footage. Too bad too because the story seemed to be headed in an interesting direction. Thank you Mr. SUTTER for four great seasonS. Going to return this and give JUSTIFIED a try.
B0099JKR6U,Brett T Moore,5,Season 5 was probably the most intense season of SOA.  I really enjoyed it and wish the next season would hurry to get here.
B0099JKR6U,Buddyjay,5,Sons of Anarchy is a very good show. However season 2 & 3 had too much small talk. They would have a good action scene and then cut it short to go to a scene where Tara and Gemma would be talking about crap or to other people talking. They did that wayyyyy too much.But season 5 was written very well. Best ever!
B0099JKR6U,Butch Holmberg,5,Great writing and story line. Should have been nominated for Golden Globe both for dramatic series and acting. Too bad :-(
B0099JKR6U,carolwho2,5,This show really rocks. I would love to meet Jax Teller on the road. I think he would make an awesome sidekick.
B0099JKR6U,Charles Daniel Christopher,5,The true appeal of this TV series comes from philosophic questions posed be John Teller in his book/letter to his sons and then in Jackson Teller's own journal/letters to his sons concerning the &#34;big questions&#34; of life.  That's why I refer to the show as Philosophy on Harlies and other similar quip-tic phrasing.
B0099JKR6U,Charles Van Cleef,2,I made the mistake of watching the series from beginning to season five in a fairly short period time. I was ill and decided that I needed to watch something serially. Seasons one through three were great. Season four started to get a little bit silly. Season five was so ridiculous that I just simply quit watching it even though I had already paid.
B0099JKR6U,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,This is so worth the small cost here on Amazon.. Am just amazed with the so well known Top Ranked Actors in this series..  Would recommend to anyone with a bit of wild side in them.. And the Irish touch they have added to it all.  Every segment of Sons just makes a person want to go right to the next.. BUY IT  Really Worth IT
B0099JKR6U,Craig Neading,5,it is a very intense show that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time. I can't wait for season 6 to come out.
B0099JKR6U,David B Pyl,5,This show does not truly show the true side of all MC clubs however it is an mind grabbing show. I wait for the new season every year!
B0099JKR6U,Dawny,5,Awesome freaking show!! I cannot wait for Season 6 to come on!!! Not only did they leave it in the air about Ron Perlman's character but Tara getting arrested???? Hmmmmm.......me thinks Gemma definitely had a hand in that.
B0099JKR6U,D. Barabino,4,I am not sorry I bought season 5 of the Sons of Anarchy I am disappointed with the show. I thought that by now it would be ending since where could it go. It seems that those in charge of it will drag out an ending that makes little sense.Instead of crazy independent this is the way we have to make through life the characters have sunk to the level of this is what we do for every thing. Will they learn how to be regular people or stay killers and thugs?
B0099JKR6U,Deborah J. Towns,5,great show! the mix of good and evil are just right served with a touch of back country justice and a bottle of tequlia and you got yourselves a meal you'll never regret eating!
B0099JKR6U,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,I have no beef with the quality or the price. However this season is not the happiest in the series. and if you don't want to see some of your favorite characters mistreated. You might not want to watch it.
B0099JKR6U,Devin Gilson,2,I can barley remember the plot. Not one redeeming quality that I can remember. Giving the choice I would not recommend this to any one.
B0099JKR6U,Doni. Wright,5,This was so worth it. Thanks for making this series available. I absolutely love it.... except to many people died. That was a bummer....
B0099JKR6U,D. Robertson,5,Most TV series begin to go downhill after about 3 years.  The story lines run out and the characters get old.  That is not true for SOA
B0099JKR6U,E. arroyo "papa che",5,The season 5 is filled with drama .betrayals  and suspense. This great show is well worth the investment of time to view.A true TV classic.
B0099JKR6U,Edgar,5,one of the best shows out there right now once you watch it once you will be hooked and this season is by far one of there best
B0099JKR6U,Elizabeth Marshall "Elizabeth Marshall",5,SOA is a show you can't quite believe you're enjoying.  Some beggars belief but still fascinates.  I can't wait until the next season!
B0099JKR6U,Evelyn Reichardt,5,Characters are getting better.  Storyline is always better. The same people are  the best actors.  They draw you in and hypnotize you.  Love Kim Coates and Tommy Flanaghan.  Have watched their careers on different shows. They are emerging as the best of actors.  Can't wait every week till the show comes on.  One of my favorite shows on cable television.
B0099JKR6U,fredd,5,Was skeptical at first. I have now watched all to date from the beginning.Is great to watch but can the writers keep it up. One mistake and its old news.
B0099JKR6U,gary seamon,5,this is a great series to watch. love that actors and actress in this series. keep you looking for more.
B0099JKR6U,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,OMG!! This was an awesome start to Season 5!!!! A superb job by Kurt Sutter as always and I can't wait to see what the remainder of the season has in store. All the actors made their characters come to life in this episode and Tig explodes on the screen.
B0099JKR6U,George Beltz,5,This series keeps getting betting every year. The changes in the plots keeps you waiting to find out what is going to happen next.
B0099JKR6U,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,This is the best crime drama since the Sopranos. There is no way I will miss this show. Thankfully we have a DVR.
B0099JKR6U,Gregory L. Erickson,5,Just when it looks like everything worked out the other shoe drops! I really can't wait for the forthcoming episodes...
B0099JKR6U,Jessica,5,What is better then getting season 5 less then a week before season 6 is going to start. This gives you just a few days to rewatch the season before the new one starts. I think they should release it at least 3 weeks before.
B0099JKR6U,joe,5,This show got many twists and turns. As well as there is more then one side to this show. I think the shows has great actors.
B0099JKR6U,John J. Schmidt,5,Can't wait for Season 6 just to see what happens next. I love the Sons of Anarchy Series and expect to continue watching as long as they keep them coming. Very Interesting cast of characters keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next surprise!
B0099JKR6U,Judy B,5,This was the best season ever and I am so glad husband and I started watching this series even though I kind of skipped the baby & Ireland stuff. Love my Prime!
B0099JKR6U,K. Thomas,5,Love the series. Great cast. Great story line. Cannot wait for the next episode. Keep them coming S. O. A.
B0099JKR6U,Liz Hart,5,I'm addicted. I'm not going to give away the plot or be a spoiler but I can't wait for this show every week. Go for it! I would have never thought I woud be the type to go for this show but I am!
B0099JKR6U,Lori "lolepere",5,The characters are so well developed ... they could be family :)  Well without all the killing :)  Hurry up and get Season 6!!!
B0099JKR6U,Lynn McBee,5,This series has far exceeded my expectations. I have really enjoyed the acting & the writing. Seems like there is no such thing as a quiet day in Charming. Was sad to find out Charlie Hunnam will not be in &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey.&#34; I haven't read the books but was glad to see Hunnam get a chance to star in a major movie.'
B0099JKR6U,Mark Hall,5,This show is getting better and better. Kurt Sutter is great. As is Ron Perlman and Charlie Hunnam and Katey Sagal. Love it!
B0099JKR6U,Megan,5,def keeps you interested!! there is so many good and bad things that happen that you just have to keep watching to make sure it all turns out ok!
B0099JKR6U,Meggan "Meggan",5,Huge fan. Always a great shopping experience when you use Amazon. Received it on time and in perfect condition. A little expensive though.
B0099JKR6U,Melissa,5,I'm so glad I have Amazon to come to when I have to miss my episodes of  SOA....would drive me nuts if I didn't :D. This show is WONDERFUL and very addictive. And Jax is HOT! :D
B0099JKR6U,Mikel,5,I was tired of waiting for netflix to load season 4 & 5 of SOA so i bought the season on amazon.  If you havent tried watching this show yet...DO IT!  This among Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead are awesome shows.
B0099JKR6U,Miss Ella,5,I've been a fan of this show- right from the very beginning.  Love the drama and all the twists and turns.  Can't wait to find out what happens next!  The writers and actors are Amazing!
B0099JKR6U,mlstillman,5,Quality of video is was very well! Some of the best acting on TV!  Hamlet on Harley's. Kurt Sutter is genius
B0099JKR6U,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",5,This gritty and violent show is not for the faint of heart but the writing is superb and the acting underated.
B0099JKR6U,nelly123,5,This is a series that give you an insight into the bikie world of hard crime but also the soft side
B0099JKR6U,Nena,5,I love Sons of Anarchy. I own seasons one through four and am watching season five on Amazon instant video because I do not have cable. SOA is so exciting and I feel close to the characters. Anyone who loves motorcycles and the bad boys that ride them will feel the same as me.
B0099JKR6U,Paul B. "mribp1",5,My wife and I are amazed with the plot twists this season. Can't wait till next season. Should be a good one.
B0099JKR6U,pepper1031,5,Bought the season so we could catch up. My husband loves this series. You never know whats going to happen and it is fantastic.
B0099JKR6U,Phyllis Henkel,5,Once you get past season 1 you are hooked!!! I am 66 and never would have imagined liking a series on bikers!!! I can't wait for season 7!!!
B0099JKR6U,rose,5,I think I already left a review on this but maybe it didn't take. I'm collecting all of SOA dvds.
B0099JKR6U,Ruth Grady,5,This is my favorite Series-we have them all and will continue to obtain them as they come out for a show that we will watch again and share with others.
B0099JKR6U,Sharon  Williams,5,We have thorougly enjoyed this series. I plan to watch it until they have stopped running episodes. It downloads right away with no issues. Thanks Amazon! reat movie!
B0099JKR6U,Shawn L Durham,5,Always a great show. Plenty of action and intrigue throughout.I look foward to each episode every week. Highly recommend it.
B0099JKR6U,sue m,5,Never ever would I have dreamed a main character would be offed. I cried. Can't wait to see the retaliation Sutter has for us.
B0099JKR6U,susan,5,he keeps up with this loves it and will continue to watch it as much as possible not a fav of mine
B0099JKR6U,Terry S Thomas,4,Makes me want to date a biker!  Wow! They take that brotherhood and family to heart.  What one word could I use to describe this show Awesome!
B0099JKR6U,Thea "Urbana",5,I very much like the intrigue of the characters and surprising events that take place it is both action packed and at times heart felt.  I patiently await each episode and recommend it to anyone who likes to ride but also enjoys a riveting story line.
B0099JKR6U,Thelby,5,This was one of the Best seasons of ANY program I have ever watched. If you have not seen it yet you just can't imagine how Super it was!!!
B0099JKR6U,w.Biedermann,5,Got this one because our DVR ate it and we can't miss our Jax fix.  All of these characters are so enthralling.
B0099JKR6U,WkdMan,5,I have been watching this series since it started and I havn't been disappointed yet.There are some aspects that creative license has been used to extremes of surrealism.Overall it is one of the best shows being produced right now though and that's entertainment.
B0099JKR6U,Wonder Woman "Jeanne",5,It is hard not to be drawn into the lives of these sociopaths. The character development is good and the treachery is non-stop. It is very violent...I would NOT recommend for kids under 17 or so and I am not a prude.
B0099JKR6U,wrighthinkingman,5,this season of SOA has more twists and turns then the Pacific Coast Highway! Every episode is a cliff hanger in one way or another.This series is EPIC.Kurt Sutter must have had some close relations or some inside access to real MC's he seems to really understand the in's and outs of the MC world.I'm in an RC and we rub elbows with all of the 1%er Outlaw Clubs in our area so I've seen the real deal up close and personal.This is by far the best season of SOA.
B009AP2G26,Amanda,3,I liked this season enough to watch it but don't LOVE it like I loved the first couple of seasons.  There are WAY too many characters to have a real story and there's just too much going on.  It's also super corny and too much &#34;Trying to teach a lesson&#34; and trying to be too politically correct.  Still love the songs tho.
B009AP2G26,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,This was a really sad episode. Season 4 got back to the heart of glee. What it was in season 1.
B009AP2G26,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",5,Glee has been going thru a difficult transition that seems to have culimated in episode Swan Song. This was the best episode so far this season. It was well balanced between the Glee Club and New York. The musicl numbers were outstanding. Still love Glee...
B009AP2G26,DY "Music City Hiker",3,I have more energy to work out when listening to great upbeat music. But the &#34;plot&#34; is going downhill from it's previous low.
B009AP2G26,Ellen H. Center,5,This is a great ensamble cast for teenagers so young.  The acting is fresh and the dramatic scenes are acted well and thoughtfully.  Great Sereis!!!
B009AP2G26,Michael F. Louis "MFL",5,The production is outstanding and the talent is dripping from all participants. It is like watching Broadway shows from your arm chair.  I love the programs. Thanks
B009AP2G26,Nicole Lewis,5,seeing this brings me to tears watching cory's last season. its sad but it's still a great show to watch
B009AP2G26,Paul Jonathan Wells,5,Every episode of this season makes me laugh and cry through every emotion!!!! I have never enjoyed a show as much as this one! The creators of Glee have saved my life!!!
B009AP2G26,Randy S. Milliron "Randune23",5,I'm not even all the way through season 4 but it keeps getting better. I really love this series. There's some high points and some low points but all in all it's a great series.
B009AP2G26,Richard Pokallus,5,The Glee series is one of the best series on TV these days. I love all the types of music that these do on the show.
B009AP2G26,Robert M. Kirwan "World Traveller",2,Too many show tunes for me.. at least I think they are show tunes because I don't recognize most of the music.
B009AP2G26,tomtom,4,Glee seems to be now overproduced to hide it's flaws. Somehow the momentum is gone. I am trying to care about the characters as I did with the original cast.
B009AP2G26,Z.M.Jamison,1,Another dumb comedy about teens and high school . Not funny and the music is awful and sounds like its from rejects from American Idol or The Voice .
B009AP3HQK,A discerning buyer,3,Better than a bad evening of TV.Richard Gere plays Richard Gere.The mega wealthy are different than the average man.Ruthless people being ruthless.
B009AP3HQK,Amazon Customer,5,Great flick available here at the same time as in theaters.  My wife is a big Richard Gere fan and she really enjoyed the movie even though it's a subject she's not particularly interested in.
B009AP3HQK,BargainHunter,4,This was a great movie to just sit back and watch with popcorn!!  It was engaging and Richard Gere is always a good actor in any role.
B009AP3HQK,Debby Bright,3,But the writing and plot is a little weak.  Susan Sarandan is completely underutilized.  Just a ho-hum movie at best.
B009AP3HQK,Dominic Freeman,4,Richard Gere has proven what a good acter he is. This is a well written story of power and money. I missed it in the theater and happy I remembered I wanted 2 C it. Great film !
B009AP3HQK,Donna L. Sako,4,Richard Gere as usual was great. I enjoyed the tension of the story line and the acting. A puzzler not action film.
B009AP3HQK,Erica L. Jablonsky,4,good solid movie that kept me engaged and love me some richard gere. Glad I watched it and spent the time.
B009AP3HQK,gizzy,5,Really enjoyed this movie. It was engrossing. Richard Gere carries it though all the acting is good. Ending is very good.
B009AP3HQK,Jacqueline A. Boyce "jack4102",4,I enjoyed the movie. Would have liked a different ending but then again it would have changed the effect I think they were looking for with approaching it the way they did. The sad truth is that there are many folks who get away with murder and a whole lot more and it is simply because they buy their way out of the situation.  Which is how this man seemed to solve everything.
B009AP3HQK,Jennifer Faries,3,I like Richard Gere and usually watch whatever movie he is in.  This was a great story about one lie leading to millions more.  It wasgood watching.
B009AP3HQK,Lynn McBee,4,This movie was very entertaining. I really enjoyed Richard Gere's performance. I also thought the story was well written and the plot was good.
B009AP3HQK,Marshaleigh,3,Nobody plays this type of roll which was well written and acted better than Richard Gere. He still has it.
B009AP3HQK,Maureen Barrett,5,I loved it!!!  Superb acting along with a great movie.  I recommend it to all Richard Gere Fans as well as fans of thriller movies.
B009AP3HQK,Pamela,5,Great performance of how deep someone can get into trouble.. Only the Rich people could still come out on top..
B009AP3HQK,Patrice L. Geathers "yenomden",1,I thought it would be like most of his movies; action-packed and fast-moving with a lot complicated scenes to figure out. I was very disappointed. The concept would have been ideal but the movies started too slow for me so I move on to another more interesting movie.
B009AP3HQK,Peter Mancini,3,Richard Gere makes a few attempts in this film to be the decent actor he has been in the past. However overall I don't think the film is excellent. Its worth the rental price. Check it out if you like these types of dramas.
B009AP3HQK,Promise "promise",2,This film is a big waste of talent.  Richard Gere at 60 still is charming and has a great hair cut.  Poor Susan Sarandon didn't do so well.  Somehow they managed to make her look fat and unattractive.  The others are uninteresting.  Some attractive but boring blond girl plays their daughter.  You'd think a child of theirs would have some personality but no.  There's a detective who does a bad Columbo impersonation.  I'm ashamed that I sat through the whole thing.  I kept watching just to see how the guy's troubles would end up and then....it was over!  What happened to him?  Frankly I didn't care much.
B009AP3HQK,Rene',3,I rented this movie because I heard good things about Richard Gere's performance and I am a fan.  I agree that some of the movie was predicatable but the final resolution was not.  Gere's performance was great as was most of the other cast members.  It would have been nice to see more of Susan Sarandon but waht she does at the end makes up for her small scene time.  Worth watching at least once.
B009AP3HQK,Rev.Carolyn J. White,1,I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere.  Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it.
B009AP3HQK,R.R.H.,1,Ending ruined the whole movie. What was that? It's like they got bored with their own story and just gave up. Bummer.
B009AP3HQK,Thomas G. Reiter,5,A very different ending that's for sure.  Richard Gere carried this film and deserved his Golden Globe nomination.  The movie has you rooting for the bad guy.
B009AP3HQK,Woodson J. Savage,2,Well-known cast with a story-line that was just average.  Did not really hold your interest in that most of the outcome was rather predictable.  Felt more like a TV movie.  Worth watching but just not outstanding.  Susan Sarandon's role was rather limited in scope.
B009C46UEK,Amazon Customer,5,This show is amazing! It has helped my toddler learn how to deal with things from dealing with her anger to potty training to sharing and helping through their short stories and catchie tunes (which are short enough for her to remember and repeat). Daniel Tiger is one of the few I dont mind her watching (and doesnt drive me insane either).
B009C46UEK,Christa Douglas,5,My whole family really loves Daniel Tiger! The show is based off of Mr Rogers Neighborhood. It has catchy little tunes used when teaching the &#34;basis&#34; of the episode and the characters in the show are cute and loveable. Awesome family show.
B009C46UEK,DDeyton,5,As soon as this is on my little one is mesmerized. She loves the songs and voices (9 months old)!!
B009C46UEK,Debbie Dillon,5,My 5 year old granddaughter loves this show. She started watching it last year and still will ask to see it again.
B009C46UEK,HannahLynn,5,Great show! Sends a wonderful message. DD sings all the songs.Can't wait until we potty train and can sing the flush and wash and be on your way song ;)
B009C46UEK,Jacob Crampton,4,It does remind me a little of Mister Roger;s but in an animated form. My son loves it and really that is what matters.
B009C46UEK,J-Squared,1,annoying. 1 yr old did not like it compared to other shows like curious george and bubble guppies... . .
B009C46UEK,Kindle Customer,5,Daniel tiger is a loved tv show and charecter in my family. I have 4yr old and 6yr old boys who love watching daniel tiger!!
B009C46UEK,lne,5,I love that part of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is still available to children of today. I am glad that my son likes it.
B009C46UEK,L. Pellow,5,Kids love Daniel Tiger because he is so extremely cute.  Adults who watched Mr. Rogers love Daniel Tiger because you get to see the puppets from the land of make-believe all grown up with children of their own.  It's a calm show that sweetly teaches lessons about friendship and life.
B009C46UEK,mari franks,5,My son enjoys watching this show. It teaches so much about character. The show keeps his attention. Don't have to worry about any of the content.
B009C46UEK,mb4574,5,This is another one that the grand kids fight over who is going to see what.  Youngest wants to watch all of the season before I turn it off.
B009C46UEK,mom12,4,Daniel tiger is funny take on Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. I always found Mr. Rogers to be a bit creepy and boring but Daniel tiger works as a cartoon. it's more fun to watch and I like the music. the kids remember the little educational lessons in the songs.
B009C46UEK,mongiesgirl,5,My 2 yr old grandson enjoys this show and watches it them over and over again. He tries to sing the songs and even stopped to run and go pee pee when the show he was watching taught him to stop and go right away when he felt the need to go. He wants to brush his teeth when he sees daniel tiger do it. It has been entertaining as well as educational.
B009C46UEK,MT,5,This is a cartoon version of Mr. Rogers and they do a good job exploring many of the topics from the original show. My son loves this show and I enjoy watching it with him.
B009C46UEK,Nycgirl,5,There is really nothing not to like about Daniel Tiger. My 2.5 year old loves it and I think my 10 month old daughter has a crush on Daniel. Her face lights up when its on:)The life lessons are perect and done in such a sweet but eduacational way. LOVE LOVE LOVEEven I get excited when i new episode airs
B009C46UEK,patriciavonhartmann,5,The format is based on the Mr. Rogers series. Good story lines and no violence. This is another good preschooler show!
B009C46UEK,R. Joshi "R. Joshi",5,My kids 3 and 5 really like this. My daughter likes it because it's fun and she likes the song.My son likes the part when he goes to school and play with blocks :)
B009C46UEK,simple,5,My 7 month loves Daniel. When the Tiger is on everyone must be quiet and all focus is on. I was happy to find this with Prime.
B009C46UEK,Tabitha,5,i didn't know what this show was all about but my daughter sits still and watches it when i put it on. its very cute.
B009C46UEK,TIna Cubero,5,So glad I have Amazon prime to run this over & over. Recommend this for all kids ages 2+. Free to watch on prime instant video
B009C46UEK,Wisconsin Girl,4,I (myself) haven't been privy to kiddy programs in quite a while.  (Daughter's in college) So when I was babysitting my sister's grand daughter I was at a loss as to what to choose for &#34;quiet time&#34; watching.  So I got out my Kindle Fire and SHE got to choose for herself!  What a hit!  Not only did she feel a little independant that it was HER choice but I was impressed (& comfortable) with her choice.  A kind and educational program we both got to snuggle on the couch and enjoy.
B009C46X8I,Chris Winchester "mikeystoyz",5,My son and I have made it though all the episodes and agree that this is a great reboot.  For some reason it reminds me more of the original turtles then the versions that have come after.  I dont know if this was done on purpose but if you have read the original series you know what I mean.  It has been toned down for the audience but it isnt as silly as the cartoons and shows that have been on before.  You get introduced to everyone in this year and it opens up for a lot more in the future.
B009C46X8I,lLily,5,This is amazing it taught my daughters that ninja skills can also defend them not just to kick anyone butt
B009C46X8I,marymurban,5,will please my little grandchildren and me. We love the turtles and have even bought masks to wear while watching.
B009C46X8I,Nicole Smith,5,Turtle power
B009CH0T9O,Gene Hacker,5,I like watching the items that people want restored. I wonderwhat people will do with these items years from now. They ll say why did I do this
B009CH0T9O,Keith A. Hartshorn,5,I always watch this series because it brings back some of my favorite memories.  The things that he restores are normally from a time period when I was a kid.
B009CH0T9O,Lurch,4,Hey don't get me wrong still watch this show it is cool BUT get rid of the drama and bring back the bringing back.  I want to see you restore not wash the laundry
B009CH0T9O,Moo,5,Simply a fun show to watch. To see the transformation of the various objects that are restored is amazing and educational.
B009CH0T9O,Pretty Granny "Teresa Ford",5,Rick Dale is an amazing artist and perfectionist. He can turn a rusty piece of junk into a museum piece. We like most of his workmen too each plays a part of making dreams come true.
B009CH0T9O,Rene Welch,5,Great Show!  I love how they can take what looks like a 'hunk of junk' and return it to it''s originalbeauty.  I am a Amazon Prime member and I will pay the 'rate hike'.  Just looking for new seasons.
B009CH0T9O,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",4,GREAT BUT THEY DONT SHOW RESTORING THE OLD ITEM LIKE LAST SEASON....BUT STILL GOOD!!! I WATCH WHEN RERUNS ARE ON
B009CP7SQI,Amazon Customer,5,the bones season eight has had a lot of surprises in it like the on e from 3 or 4 episodes ago.
B009CP7SQI,amrbilly,5,it a great show and alway good story line and never get bored. i am glad it will be back next year!
B009CP7SQI,angelicflamesva,1,WHY am I paying to watch commercials both before & after the show?! Iam NOT going to continue paying for these shows with commercials! I have a very limited amount of internet and these stupid commercials take up a valued portion! STOP MAKING US PAY FOR COMMERICIALS!!!!
B009CP7SQI,Boulder Mike,4,My 5 year old loves the show and the music..even my 10 year old was hooked for a while. We started giving other shows and movies a "bone" name so that he just agrees to watch them ( "Indiana Bones")..unfortunately he learned the difference quickly...4 stars for that..
B009CP7SQI,Carol C. MacLeod,5,I've been with Bones since the beginning. There were times it was a love/hate relationship. This season is by far the best so far!
B009CP7SQI,David Lehmann,5,We like the Bones episode because it is not a serial it is a new story with each episode- there is a beginning and a conclusion within that weeks story (few exceptions that carry over but very few).  I don't lie the soap opera scheme where nothing is ever resolved.  The story moves quickly.  The characters are interesting and the relationships are evolving which adds to the interest.
B009CP7SQI,Deacon Blue,5,I love the way the writers combine comedy with often-gruesome forensic work. It's a little bit like &#34;CSI&#34; meets &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;
B009CP7SQI,duncanhaus,5,I am so hooked on the Bones series.  I have Netflixed all the previous 7 seasons and now am ready for the 8th.
B009CP7SQI,flygirltaylor,5,I absolutely love this show and download episodes to my kindle so I can watch them while on long plane rides.  Love it!
B009CP7SQI,gitaday "Gitaday",5,It is so intelligent is the main reason I watch it. I love the characters but the plot and science drives the show
B009CP7SQI,Jennifer  Sahlberg,5,One word for all season's and all episodes........AMAZING!!!!!!! Will never be another of it's kind like it. Wonderful family show.
B009CP7SQI,J. Gwin "Jules",5,Excellent quality in audio and video. Love the Bones episodes. Have all episodes in the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO on my ROKU.
B009CP7SQI,Judith A. Chandler,5,Are you kidding this is the best!!  Great mystery and detection but the stars are fabulous to watch.  David B. yummy.
B009CP7SQI,justnora,5,Bones is always interesting. The cast works so well together and the technical aspects are really quite impressive. I find myself watching re-runs in between seasons. Looking forward to the new season!
B009CP7SQI,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,From the very first show I was hooked.  Long running series allow the writers to fully develop their characters are the job they have done is great.  Would like to see Zack appear in another show.  Was not thrill with the latest eposide.  Will wait for final judgment to see if I continue watching.
B009CP7SQI,Kindle Customer "knitting hobby",1,I am very upset with amazon. I bought this and was unable to view it on my amazon fire. I tried contacting them 3 times nothing was resolved and I did not get my money back. Finally I tried my computer it worked but I did not buy it to watch on my computer. Now I hesitate to buy videos from axon knowing they may not be playable on my amazon fire
B009CP7SQI,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,this is a show I look forward to weekly.  I have been watching it since it started and think it is a great show.
B009CP7SQI,Lawrence Jackson,4,For all you red meat types who like your copycat CSI programs this is one has the most entertaining characters. Most of them are 100% dysfunctional but they dress to kill and again solve all their crimes with high tech lab junk and computers. Watch it while you eat to get the most from there defleshing corpses. Obviously they never smelled a three day old rotting body. Other than that it is fun.
B009CP7SQI,mary deleal,4,I really like Bones and the characters that are brought up in each episode. The main characters are fun to watch
B009CP7SQI,Michael Dobey,5,My local channel went down the night this was aired. SO I had to buy this episode off instant video. This was the best 9/11 episode that I have yet seen from a normal tv series and that is saying alot. The cast was excellent as you would expect too.  This time they had all of the interesting helpers that doctor brennan uses at hand. These are the rotating cast members that often appear in various episodes. Here they work together and the results are very good. (one of the rotating members was killed off a few seasons ago though). Bones chemistry between it's two leads has evolved and the show contiues to deliver on top scripts and flat out well done episodes. But this was one of the show's finest hours by far. The 9/11 storyline was both touching and poignant and the relationship between the formally pure intellectual Brennan and the heroic Booth character is welcome. Brennan has evolved through her interaction from her 'family' on this show from a cold distant analytical person to a more rounded person. Of course she was like that because of her terrible upbringing to be sure. (and her giant intellect only increased this situation). Even if you have never seen aepisode of this show this powerful one about sacrifice and rememberence will affect you. As one character says in this episode:'9/11 traumatized everyone that day" and we often forget that.
B009CP7SQI,Michael S. Jessop "Generalist",4,The show has changed a lot over the the past two seasons but it still has more or less the same feel it has always had.
B009CP7SQI,Michelle King,5,I love the characters and the theme of the show.  It keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat.
B009CP7SQI,Micky,5,Have enjoyed the birth and the drama of Bones' vulnerability and being a Mom;  the chemistry between Bones and Booth is still on ...
B009CP7SQI,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,I love this show and I would recommend this show to everyone. and it did not mess up on amazon.
B009CP7SQI,Patricia M. Brown,5,I have watched Bones since day 1. I have been hoping Bones and Booth would get together since the first season. So this is the season I've been waiting for. I am really glad I bought the TV pass so I won't miss even one episode.
B009CP7SQI,Roy E. Oetting,2,I like "Bones". I watch it on Amazon since I don't have cable. The characters are great and i like the way they interact and even when a show story might be weak I just enjoy the conversations. The actors do a great job of portraying their characters. So why did I give this weeks show a 2? Mainly because Hodgens unequivocally states that 911 was not a conspiracy. There is no way if Hodgens really existed that he wouldn't at least keep his mind open. This is a political statement that the viewers are supposed to gobble up. Nobody wants to believe the truth.
B009CP7SQI,stoneyb,5,I love Bones.  Its so nice to be able to watch a current show you have missed.  The stars keep you interted for minute one to the very end.
B009CP7SQI,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",5,to the previous seasons. It has charm. It is sort of like a good homemade soup of a tv show.
B009CP7SQI,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,Seriously. We buy these to avoid commercials if fox continues this we will stop buying these videos. Want to test us? Keep the commercials and watch your revenue fall.Update 4/2/2013Since Fox has refused to stop the commercials I have cancelled this season and will not buy any more seasons of Bones. If this persists I will subsequently start cancelling / not renew all of my Fox shows. There are plenty of providers who don't put commercials in videos I pay for so I will not stand for having commercials impressed upon me.
B009CPIQQE,Amazon Customer,1,It sucked as a movie. The sound was scratching in spots well a lot of spots but I don't think that is Amazons fault. Withing minute from the start you knew the entire movie before it happened.
B009CPIQQE,liesel strong,3,I liked the story about the tree. The strange happenings were creepy and even though I expected some supernatural outcome the ending was feasible.
B009CPIQQE,specialkrp,1,This is one of the worst foreign films of the year in my opinion. Definitely skip it cause there are much better ones out there to be viewed.
B009CZ4QMW,Boulder Mike,5,Good story and good actors. The main actress is reasonably hot - which makes up for the reality gaps when it comes to the scenes in the hospital. So it has all the ingredients for a successful show. Not sure what all the complaining is about. They even gonna cancel it and going backward and forward about when. Hopefully they stick to the full season with all 13 shows.
B009CZ4QMW,Carol T,4,This is one good show. It is interesting in its story as well as well written and well acted. The Chicago mob types are quite real..almost as real as Sopranos guys!! I cannot believe that Fox cancelled. I do recommend that it be bought even for the one season - its good and the story does wrap up and does not leave the viewer hanging as do so many other cancellations. Carol T
B009CZ4QMW,Jenny,3,It just isn't close to life..She is running around like a chicken a real Doctor doesn't do that...I don't know just could get into the show that much. Mobs and medicine is one of my favorite you see I'm a movie buff...
B009CZ4QMW,Mary-Ann "mag89",2,The concept of the show...that the doctor has to compromise her principles by doing jobs for the mob to protect her brother just didn't work.  I can't imagine week after week is not my cup of tea.
B009D4PG62,dennis,3,Very disappointing in the movie now. Plenty of great effects but not a great story or acting or anything. Just thought it would be much better.
B009D4PG62,Patricia Appelquist,4,while I think the kicker at the end of the movie is kinda our comeuppance Ridley Scott yeilded to the out cry or outrage for a prequel
B009DB82WK,Scriptor "jigsaw1999",5,My only wish is that they could release the season's episodes faster.  The wait is far too long between episode releases.
B009DB8UFY,Bob,5,My 3 and 4 year olds love it!  Great that there are so many seasons of it here!  Not our old Mickey though...
B009DNVLH6,Jacob Crampton,5,If you love Survivor then you will love this season. It is the same format that has been working for years.
B009DNVLH6,L. Robinson,5,I love every season of Survivor.  It is nice to be able to rewatch old seasons while waiting for the next new one to begin!
B009DNVLH6,trixie,5,I LOVED ALL THE SURIVIOR SEASONS.
B009DNVLQW,DENISE NAVARRO,5,I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THIS PROGRAM.  I LOVE TO SEE THE CAST TRY AND WORK THINGS OUT.
B009DNVLQW,Jacob Crampton,5,I have been a fan of the show for years and would watch any of the seasons. This one is just as good as the rest.
B009DNVLQW,JB,5,I enjoyed this season from beginning to end. I'm a big Survivor fan and this is easily one of my favorite seasons. Very entertaining.
B009F11B7Q,Amber R Burkhart,5,Bought this for my husband. And he watches it as soon as a new episode pops up. If he's happy then I'm happy!
B009F11B7Q,Chris Schoenrock,5,Action and drama. The shows gives you a great balance of both. Amstrad Baumgaedner steals the show. His acting is top notch.
B009F11B7Q,Eric Hoover,1,Bad show. Not sure why this was made.  It is sort of like the book &#34;on the beach&#34; but not good. It was cancelled quick which should tell you all you need to know
B009F11B7Q,GKJ,5,I have heard this show will be cancelled. This was disappointing news to say the least. I always looked forward to each new episode. The episodes flew by because the episodes were intense and left me wanting more. I do not know if the networks read our reviews on amazon. But personally I would rate this show as more than five stars. Maybe the network should try a different night to air this show to avoid cancellation. I wish they would gve it one more season and try another night.
B009F11B7Q,J3F,3,The extreme hollywood portrayal of the likelihood that a submarine captain would go rogue armed with nuclear weapons. . .
B009F11B7Q,Jacry1990,5,A tense and exciting show. We enjoyed it very much. Gives a lot of thought into what a government can and would do for its own benefit!
B009F11B7Q,Kat Kay "Kat Kay",5,I love this show.  I like the way it protrays women in an important role.  The show is very exciting with lots of action.
B009F11B7Q,Linda Saxton,5,Thus is the best show on ABC this season. I can't wait for it to start again in January. It is exciting a real nail bitter.
B009F11B7Q,S. Warren,4,If you into drama with action this is a nice one with some twists and mystery.  Though something in the story seem a little off from what military would do.  Its fun to watch if you into military conspiracies and twists.
B009F11B7Q,William Hodges,5,I was disappointed to learn ABC plans to drop the show. I would hope another network would consider it as it is entertaining and interesting to watch.
B009F6PNGQ,Jacob Crampton,5,I really liked this season but I was hoping for a different winner. Oh well it was still worth watching.
B009F6PNGQ,JB,5,This is a standout season for me for a few reasons. It has several excellent players with big personalities and one heck of a villain. Very entertaining! I love Survivor and really hope Amazon starts offering more seasons for Prime Members.
B009F7QE0E,Amazon Customer "Tina &#34;Dutchgirl&#34;",5,Haven is a wonderful series.  The characters are engaging with personalities that range from humorous to super serious and everything in between.  We look forward to every show.
B009F7QE0E,Big John MacK,5,Great plot more twists and more questions what is going on. Is she a God?????. This series just keeps getting better and better
B009F7QE0E,Book worm,5,The stories always keep you entertained and surprised.  Not the same old stale stories that a lot of shows keep repeating.
B009F7QE0E,Cindy Powell~Herzog,5,Haven you have not let me downthe Season # 3 is as great as the pilot...thank you so much for not being like the other series that run out of material
B009F7QE0E,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,The show continues to be creative and interesting.  The writing is good and the characters are multidimensional but remember these are based on a story by Steven King so they don't always play nice :)
B009F7QE0E,Gary Tashman,5,I just love this show. So different. We learn about Audrey and the Colorado kid. I will watch season four.
B009F7QE0E,J. Mitchell,4,Now we have the new twists as time is running out for Audry - Skin Walker... who is it under the skin?
B009F7QE0E,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,I love haven.  I have watched it since the beginning.  I miss when it is not on.  A great show
B009F7QE0E,Larry McAuley,5,They just seem to get so close to a solution and then it slips away.  Writers for this show must have some serious creativity to not repeat the same issues over and over again.
B009F7QE0E,Neal "MerlinFL",5,I like this show but was expecting more King-like aspects.  It's very well done in it's own right and I hope they can keep the story going for at least one ore season.
B009F7QE0E,norma jean kringer,5,I wasn't sure I would like this program but it is Stephen Kings best work.  It has such a variety of odd stories that you can't wait to watch the next.  I never get tired of watching them over and over because of such unique tales
B009F7QE0E,Pulpman,4,I really enjoy this show. I just put in a disc and sit back and relax with it. It makes me comfortable to be in Haven with all of it's characters and subplots. It is easy to follow and a fun ride at the same time. The characters are likeable and you care what happens to them. I recommend this easy going series to those who like a good but light fantasy series you can't go wrong on this show and it is refreshing to just watch a good show after a tough day.
B009F7QE0E,Rainbowmoon,5,I had missed several episodes of Haven last year for several reasons. It was good to catch up on the 'adventures' of everyone in the cast.
B009F7QE0E,Ralph J. Fitcher "Namahotitae",5,This is one of the best seasons ever. There are plenty of twists and turns in this season. They answer a lot of the unanswered questions and lead up to an amazing season in season 4.
B009F7QE0E,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,Here is another show that breaks from the norm and sets out on a new and different path.  A cast of characters with special abilities that are drawn to the town of Haven.  Also includes a love triangle that doesn't get too gooey.  I highly recommend this show.  Maintains the high standards set by Season 1 & 2.
B009F7QE0E,sewready,4,I like it and am quite anxious to see the next season. Interesting take on SciFi. Don't pass it up.
B009F7QE0E,Steve Bystrak,5,This is why I hate filling these things out. I don't really have anything  to say outside of what I already said.
B009F7QE0E,Susan Harris,5,I love this series and all the actors in it.  I love how their characters are melding together and growing. I cant wait for the next weeks show to come.
B009FJJNQE,Ron Baker,3,A story of transition. Well filmed and acted. A very sad and somewhat sweet story of a young boy grappling with a very strange and tragic situation.
B009FZFONO,1337 "It'll either be night to treasure or a ...,4,It was still pretty good and interesting. Sadly 'clan wars' took about the whole season. I wish there was a little more than just that. But then there's season 4. So I guess it's okay. Also glad some of the characters were gotten rid of. Finally we'll see some of the new characters. Glad the best characters are still alive and kicking :)
B009FZFONO,Amazon Customer,3,I have to say I think that though this was a good season per say this show has &#34;Jumped the shark&#34; and I most likely will not get next season
B009FZFONO,Anne Deaton "Maggie - Cocker Momma",5,This show gets progressively better and better as the cast and story expands' The viewer comes to actally know and empathize with so many of the cast and their losses and grief. There is frustration with many of the characters as they refuse to adapt and accept the lossof so much that may never be able to be replaced or recovered. That very refusal leads to many unnecessary deaths and much grief and yet they feel they must cling to their very &#34;humanity&#34; or everything worth living and striving for is already lost.... A dilemma without n answer?
B009FZFONO,Anon "Anon",5,This show is epic... Mad max meets zombie land humor gore everything good and everything bad... It's a great show!
B009FZFONO,A. Robinson "hotarobin",5,Interesting story line.  More a story about survival than a senseless zombie flick.  The type of series that makes you think &#34;what if???&#34;
B009FZFONO,AUBREYGAMMON3,5,That My Favorite Tv serie I Love To Watch The Zombie Movie. Let Me Know When The Walking Dead Back Video.
B009FZFONO,aztnge,5,The acting by all of the actors is superb ~ truly shows the diversity & perserverance of the human race to survive under &#34;extreme&#34; conditions!
B009FZFONO,Barbara J. Mcdermott,5,Every episode is filled with excitement. I missed an episode and downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. How easy. No skips and stops or slowdowns. Smooth as silk. The price was really attractive. I know now not to get too worried if I do miss it because it will be there for me on Amazon.
B009FZFONO,Bash,4,The writers are killing off all the original actors so fast before their characters are fully developed. Some of these zombies need to start starving off or rotting away. Fewer but faster and deadly walking dead that have tactics & work as a team in wolf pack instead of mass slow herds.
B009FZFONO,bbrockRailFan "Brian Brocksmith",5,Wow this series just keeps getting better each season. This set is another fabulous edition to the collection. Kirkman and company never fail to entertain. Often when watching the show on cable tv it is interrupted with allot of commercials. This is a great way to watch the show again without the need to be bothered by them. Some people DVR this show but you still have to go out of your way to fast fwd through them and that can be an annoying task.
B009FZFONO,Benjamin H. Massey,3,Action light episodes and even a large lack of zombies in most episodes make for a lackluster season. It seems to crawl along at a frustrating pace
B009FZFONO,Boulder Mike,5,This is the best zombie show..one of the best post-apocalyptic screen plays. Very well made and storyline is great. Picture and character development are great. Season 3 is either the &#34;governor&#34; season or the &#34;prison&#34; season. I dont think the prison is a pleasant scenery  ( the farm in the early season was much better ) ..but the story and actors make up for it..
B009FZFONO,Brabass,5,This series is awesome the zombies are great and the series keeps you hooked. You will be waiting for the next episode with anticipation!
B009FZFONO,Brittany Thompson,5,Me and my husband started watching this series on Netflix and had to see the last season before the new one in October. Hands down the best show I have ever watched!!
B009FZFONO,btjones1983,5,Another fantastic season with plenty of twists and sub plots to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wife and I love to sit down and watch this season and the previous seasons even though we have already seen the episodes multiple times. Great storyline with plenty of character development.
B009FZFONO,Carol C. MacLeod,5,I have been waiting for this series forever. It is cool. Right now I'm having a love/hate relationship yet. I can't believe that some people are so stupid. BUT I still want to watch it every week!
B009FZFONO,carolwho2,5,This show is awesome. I can't think of anything else to say but you have to use so many words to review.
B009FZFONO,CARRIE,5,I have all the seasons and absolutely love this show. I just think they kill off too many characters to soon. Other than that I enjoy watching this show. Very entertaining. I can't wait until the next season..
B009FZFONO,C E Matthews,5,Love this show!! So glad I can see it on Amazon - since my provider does not have it. This season is so good - it can only get better!
B009FZFONO,cindy lou who,5,i loved the fact that you can watch it anytime and on my pc it was great. i tried to find these episodes on all different webs and amazon was the best.
B009FZFONO,C. J. Gerhardt,5,What can I say except that it gets more interesting and the writers seem willing to take some serious broad strokes with the story and cast. Keep it up!CJ
B009FZFONO,Cletus van Damme,5,My God what an episode. I was not expecting so much change so fast. The writers really know what they are doing.
B009FZFONO,CMZ Art,5,Especially love the ability to make the close captioning larger.Very easy to access...I give it 5 stars.Recommend to lovers of sci-fi.
B009FZFONO,Codie Schlotterbeck,5,This season is amazing!!! Walking Dead is so intense.  I am definitely ready for the last of this season to come out.  Love the Walking Dead.
B009FZFONO,cottageprims,5,I'm not a real gore or zombie fan but Love this series! Always a great storyline.Makes you want to keep watching.
B009FZFONO,Craig C. Albano,4,Great show and the streaming via Prime via Roku has been easy and fast. It's also convenient to have this available when traveling.
B009FZFONO,CristiAk "Reading is powerful",5,One of the best series on television. Season one was a little slow. Season two picked up the pace and now season three... amazing! The actors on this series are awesome. They do an amazing job making their characters real. The writing is excellent. Make up is superb. These zombies scare me. I noticed more gore in this season. I liked how this season is showing more of the human response to the zombie apocalypse. Not everyone who survives is going to be good. Not every good survivor will stay good. Writing this into the show makes it more realistic. I could say more but do not want to give out any spoilers. Overall this is an excellent series that just keeps getting better.
B009FZFONO,Danar "Ardent Booky",5,It's the Walking Dead! What much is there to say?!The picture quality was great and I will purchase more movies and television series from Amazon in the future.
B009FZFONO,David B Pyl,5,This show does not need words to rate it. This show has gone viral and everyone is dipping their hands in the cookie jar when it comes to this show. I couldn't wait for the new season to start and I just love this show.
B009FZFONO,Dawna324,5,My only problem with &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is that there is not enough of it per season. I did not think I would like this show because I have always been afraid of such graphical bloody movies. But once I got past the first 30 minutes of the Pilot I WAS HOOKED for life.
B009FZFONO,dray83,5,The Walking Dead is without a doubt one of the best action/horror/drama shows on television today.  It is the only tv show I know of that combines all of those genres with great story telling and compelling characters.  There is hardly ever a dull moment and I cannot wait to see each episode to come and hope this show lasts for many seasons!!
B009FZFONO,E B Fricks,5,Me and my teens watched all three seasons in a weeks time.very well done. five stars! can't wait for the new season to air!!
B009FZFONO,edith banes,5,The best season ever.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. So many surprises in each episode.
B009FZFONO,Eric Hoover,3,This is the one season that they could have done without.  Too much prison time and Woodberry time.  Not a good mix.  But you have to watch to keep up with the story.
B009FZFONO,Frank D. Castellano "fcaste",5,G R E A T ! ! !  As usual it's been a very great series to watch and hope it will continue . . .
B009FZFONO,G. "Beam",5,great show once i got over the grossness factor. Unpredictable and keeps you guessing. who will get be the one to go next?
B009FZFONO,Gwen M McDole,4,I really enjoy the Walking Dead. I have been a fan from the very beginning. At times the show seems very drawn out but I really just watch it for the Zombies.
B009FZFONO,harleygal,1,This is what we waited for? What a major disappointment ! This is one chapter you can save your money on and you wont miss a thing
B009FZFONO,Jack Summer,1,I believe I was looking for another movie title and wasn't sure what a friend of mine was  watching.  This definitely was not the movie I wanted to watch.
B009FZFONO,Jacob,5,Been following them since Season 1.  Once in a while I go back and watch that first espisode.  It was sooo good.
B009FZFONO,James A. Moore "Jim",5,Hopefully the writers and advertisers will see it our way and give us another season. I feel like there's a whole bunch more that can be told.
B009FZFONO,Jeffrey A. Hensley "Hensley's Bluegrass Music",5,This is yet another great installment of the walking dead.  I think Season three has recaptured some of the qualities that made season one so great (and seemed lacking in season two).
B009FZFONO,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Action packed great show. Hubby got me addicted. Love the ease of a season pass the show just shows up in my library. This show is intense gory and scary. Not family fair by any means. But once you start watching you really want to know what is next.
B009FZFONO,johnny,5,this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!!! so good!! we can not wait until the next season
B009FZFONO,Joseph Marrero "manvscode",5,This show is amazing.  It's unpredictable and action packed.  It can be emotional at times.  I find myself talking to the television in much the same way my girlfriend talks to the tele during her soap operas.  This show is AWESOME! Gawr!
B009FZFONO,Josh L. Hansen "J Hansen",5,The seiries is still kicking butt after three seasons.  I have always been a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this series has consistently gone way above expectations.  LOVE IT!
B009FZFONO,Judith A. Chandler,5,Thanks so much for this.  I needed to catch up!!!  Watched 1 and 2 on Netflix so needed to catch up with current shows.  Easy to download on the computer with no interruptions.
B009FZFONO,Judith Tyler,5,This show continues to be fantastic. just enough balance of action and drama. Can't wait for the new season. Lots of plot twists that I never saw coming!!!
B009FZFONO,kathleen capela,5,until this series I never likes zombie movies and this got me hooked I cant wait for season 4 hurry up season 4
B009FZFONO,kei. "g.k. bevido",5,I purchased Season 3 via Amazon Prime because I like this show; I own the first two seasons also. thanx.
B009FZFONO,Kerry A. Barndt,5,Actors are excellent!  Episodes go by so quick & when they end you just want more.  Great all around; I wouldn't watch without watching the first 2 seasons.
B009FZFONO,K. Robertson,3,I think the first two seasons had more draw and events to them. I dislike the loss of certain characters but that is part of the story. The ending does not leave you hanging as much as the others so I have less desire or anticipation to see more.
B009FZFONO,Lauren,5,Love the surpises and relationships.  Great series.  A drama based on relationships of people you grow to care about.  You get involved in their struggles and cheer them on.
B009FZFONO,Lynne A. James "Lynne",5,This is a wonderful series and never disappoints! I am really looking forward to season 4. I am really invested in these characters.
B009FZFONO,mari franks,5,I love the walking dead. Best tv series ever. We never miss an episode. We always down load on to the kindle fire the next day.
B009FZFONO,Megan,5,Love it! you never knew what traumatic event was going to happen next. Keeps you on your toes for sure!.
B009FZFONO,Michael Chen,5,This is the best show of the last decade....well including Game of Thrones.  Not else more I can say.  I'm soo glad this season is waayyyy better than the second season.
B009FZFONO,Michael J. Scott,5,This may well have been one of the best seasons ever as the plot thickens.  I can't wait for Season Four.
B009FZFONO,Michelle King,5,I liked the first season and the next two do not disappoint you. My husband really likes this tv show.
B009FZFONO,microsoft is not monop,1,1 escapism? no2 boring dialog yes3 whiny characters that don't react with anything like realism? yep4 evil white men and mindless hicss vs women and minorities? yep5 any sense of danger from zombies no6 plot with no coherence? yep7 enjoyable at all? naaaa
B009FZFONO,M. McKenzie,5,The writing gets better and better -not weaker and desperate. It's nice to see the life hasn't left the Walking Dead yet!
B009FZFONO,mvlver,5,Just keeps me guessing over and over. plot change direction very quickly. Has me waiting for whats next. This is the kind of show you can watch and then come back a month or 2 later and its new because yo see what you missed.
B009FZFONO,Nancy Mayton,5,This movie is constant action always something to look forward to all the rest. Can not wait to see whats next.
B009FZFONO,Nh granite,5,This is the best.  I canrt wait for new episodes.  I am engaged in the characters and the plot.  The zombies almost seem secondary...almost.
B009FZFONO,normaporter,5,This is my favorite show to watch every week. I was never a zombie movie fan but I do like watching the group go through their struggles each week just to stay alive.
B009FZFONO,OlyNomad,5,This was an awesome episode!  That final scene was so intense and well-acted by (the character) Rick.  I'm so glad they went that direction and it definitely has us wondering what will happen next.
B009FZFONO,O. Vaughn "Movie Fan",5,I'm not much for horror / gore but this character driven show is the exception.  I turn my  head through the really gory parts so I can watch the development of these complicated characters. Great show!
B009FZFONO,Patricia Doherty,5,A tale of two cities at odds.  A beloved character resurfaces as a peacemaker.  The characters establish a fortifiable home and develop further.
B009FZFONO,rgoodi,5,This show is terribly addictive! I had heard about if from some friends and gave them the &#34;whateve&#34; eye roll. Then I watched the first episode. Great! I've been strung out like a junky ever since. I can't wait for the next episode.
B009FZFONO,Richee,5,I recommend this show Very much so !! One of the Best shows out there !! You must watch it from the very beganing. Don't doubt me. Watch it !!
B009FZFONO,Rick,5,Non-stop action and great special effects. Going into a prison was pure genius. We get a new character and all the returning characters are somewhat different from last season. Carl is a bad ass and Daryl is now second in command. Hersel aged quite a bit. Rick is no longer bonding with his wife and Carol is horny for Daryl. Glen and Maggie continue their romance. Can't wait until episode #2 - more new characters and more of the fabulous Prison set. Please do more with T-Dog. There is potential there and his role in the group has always been on the back burner.
B009FZFONO,R. M "movier",5,I Loved the first season and was surprised at how the second season ended. I am looking forward to this season.
B009FZFONO,Rockster12,5,I wish the season was a bit longer. This show is awesome. The graphics are great and the story line is great as well. I would recommmend watching the frist two seasons before watching this one.
B009FZFONO,Rodrigo Garay,5,I really enjoy this show and all the creative talent involved. I really think that they have recaptured the classic Zombie genre that has been so elusive as of late for other film makers.
B009FZFONO,samintochess,5,I must find out what happens next. I want to see if the baby grows up to become just as heartless a killer as her brother is.
B009FZFONO,scififanatic,5,Should I be worried that the zombies don't bother me at all after 2 full seasons? ;-) ;-)  Great season premiere.  A good set up for another few months of nail biting action.
B009FZFONO,Scriptor "jigsaw1999",5,Season 3 is the best of The Walking Dead to date.  The first episode is nothing but action that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Highly recommended.
B009FZFONO,seetheartsoftly,5,love the walking dead but they should do it from how it got stared and who did it from the get go how did it spread in the air
B009FZFONO,Shanbear16,4,If you haven't given up on the show by now then you'll be pleasantly surprised by what season three has to offer.
B009FZFONO,Shannon J.,5,well written and suspenseful cant wait to see the rest of the season. It is much better with the different writers
B009FZFONO,Shawn L Durham,5,Great storyline. The actors were chosen for their roles very well.  Even though it is about zombies it's well written and well acted.
B009FZFONO,shaz,5,All time favorite show- one episode and you are hooked !  best to watch from season 1 so you understand it all. and Darryl Dixon yumm  &#60;3  :p
B009FZFONO,shelly,5,I understand this might not be for everyone but ... has an excellent story line ! great characters! and the zombies are excellent! I am completely hooked!
B009FZFONO,Sr Happy Popi "Mr. Stacy J.",3,Everybody loves &#34;Walking Dead&#34;.  Great production values.  Tremendous acting for SF/horror series.I especially enjoy Glenn and Maggie - a great couple.  Guess the premise got a little tired for me this season.
B009FZFONO,S. Warren,5,Still following the show pretty well.  Still surprised by the character development and story twist that pull me into the show.
B009FZFONO,thecoolcard,5,best show on tv it s #1 ........ and number 2 is not even close.  each episode gets better and better never a let down. cant wait to see what is next
B009FZFONO,tigger,5,A must see  if you love the series ! Can't wait for the second half of season. Purchased from Amazon...so cool...NO COMMERCIALS !
B009FZFONO,Travis Anderson,5,Gonna have to buy more episodesMy family and I love this show it is a great show that we all love to watch.
B009FZFONO,Tristan "Tristan",5,This show will suck you in the moment you start watching. We can't get enough and can't wait for the next season on Prime!
B009FZFONO,Ucrazy!,5,This definitely has to be my current favorite show.  I love the way they use the moral dilemmas to pull the watcher into the action!
B009FZFONO,Venna,5,My husband and I love this show. We have 2 children so when it is time to watch this show it is our time. It is amazing love it. What more can I say.
B009FZFONO,WkdMan,5,After the first couple of shows I was hooked and have remained so. Every season more twists and turn's and characters are added.That keeps me always looking forward to the next show or season.
B009FZFONO,Yar,5,this is one of the best episodes of the season. unfortanly you wait until the last 7 min for action
B009GEAWOU,Adam Rutledge,5,This is actually a pretty funny series. My wife turned me into it. Its about a group of close friends. Its funny and I would recommend it if you a fan of comedy TV shows. You should give it a try you want be disappointed
B009GEAWOU,Ariel Miller,5,The characters are rich and the writing is excellent.  The episodes are 22 minutes and it's great for a quick laugh without requiring too much of a time commitment.
B009GEAWOU,becca,5,How they keep coming up with the shenanigans they get into baffles me. Love the unity of the crew no matter what new things happen. Can't wait to see Ted meet his wife :)
B009GEAWOU,Chris Schoenrock,5,The show is great. The cast and writing are both excellent. I highly recommed all the seasons. We are getting closer to finding out who the mother is.
B009GEAWOU,Christopher R. Williams,5,thought this was going to be the last season. you could feel that they are about to lose the charm of the show but it holds true in most of the episodes. still definitely a funny show.NPH is the man
B009GEAWOU,Codie Schlotterbeck,5,Himym is probably one of the best comedies written in our time! I will be very sad when it ends.
B009GEAWOU,Eric Hoover,5,This has gone on too long.  Who cares anymore.  I wish the kids had never been born.  Please end this.
B009GEAWOU,JT,5,...unless you don't watch from season 1 episode 1.  By far the best series on TV and will continue to be the best!
B009GEAWOU,K'ann Strohl,5,Really enjoyed being able to watch the entire series at my own pace. Hope u continue to offer these awesome series programs for your customers.
B009GEAWOU,KD Josh,5,Our family loves how I met your mother.  We watch it as often as we can.  Barney is such a funny character.
B009GEAWOU,Lilia,5,I love &#34;how i met your mother.&#34; I am sad to see it go but glad its on Amazon! Awesome!
B009GEAWOU,M Parker,4,I really like this tv series. I just keep hoping Ted will find who he is going to marry.  Mean while everyone can remember what its like to be young and single.
B009GEAWOU,MrsGoose "MrsGoose",5,Another great season of howI met your mother I can't wait to see the rest of the season! Love this show!!
B009GEAWOU,RPC,5,This is a great series I have watched over and over. Great story line and plenty of laughs Sorry to see it go
B009GEAWOU,Shanbear16,4,The show still funny most of the time and the actors are still fantastic but it does have the feeling of being stretched out. I think it's time we finally meet the mother!
B009GEDP26,amrbilly,5,they have alot of history each other and they are perfect for each other. it a very awesome show and i never get bored every show!
B009GEDP26,babs,4,This is a fabulous show however two of the episodes this season were just a bit too far fetched.  Still love it however and every single episode cannot appear the every viewer.
B009GEDP26,brenda "open door",5,I love this season.  I like that the relationship between Castle and Beckett finally happened.  The magnetism between the two is so good I keep looking to see if they are a real couple.  This is the way a show should be.  A good human story and a good mystery with a minimum of violence and gore.  True story telling.  This show is one of the few shows now on TV that I really like to watch.  It is good.  I hope it is around a few more years.
B009GEDP26,christel,5,VERY GOOD PLOT LINES.  THE WRITERS ARE GREAT AND KEEP ME COMING BACK FOR MORE.  THE REGULAR CHARACTERS ARE LIKEABLE.
B009GEDP26,djdave,5,Another great season with a fun show that I look forward to getting each year since I don't watch on commercial tv during the year. Things have matured in several ways was this year. The daughter is off in college. There is romance finally thrown into the mix. I really enjoyed this.
B009GEDP26,Jane Zachary,5,Nathan is still the sexiest man on tv - perhaps the sexiest man anywhere! But kudos to Stana for serving as his near-perfect foil.
B009GEDP26,J. Gwin "Jules",5,Excellent quality in audio and video. Love the Castle episodes. Have all episodes in the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO on my ROKU.
B009GEDP26,jim,4,enjoyable watch good characters and watchable episodes. The dynamic between shows a symbiotic relationship that is interesting to watch and see grow
B009GEDP26,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",4,this series is good but I am seeing some pretty bad writing towards the end of this season. I fear they may be wrapping things up. Actors are good actors though.
B009GEDP26,kevin m love,5,Five years in but the characters keep getting more interesting.  I am pleased the relationship between the two has not derailed the storyline.
B009GEDP26,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,Love this show.  It is one I can watch over and over again.  I have watched castle from the beginning also.
B009GEDP26,Laura,5,Like usually this is great Castle. It's hard to stop watching but you have to do other things too. I would recommend to anybody
B009GEDP26,Lindalee Ausejo,5,I love the entire series of Castle.....and have them all. There are only a few of the American programs that I love and Castle is one of them.
B009GEDP26,L.J. Brown,5,The season 1 through 5 are wonderful.  I hope they will be able to keep the show going as NCIS has with twists and turns.
B009GEDP26,Marian,5,Love all the characters... So glad that Castle & Kate are together now... Love watching it every time... Can't wait for the next episode...
B009GEDP26,mary deleal,5,It is great to be able to stream on amazon prime. The show is so cute and sometimes it makes you think real hard
B009GEDP26,MVivar,4,This series is often a little humorous and the characters seem to be having fun in spite of dealing with some really mean folks. Maybe I'll have to read at least one of &#34;Richard Castle's&#34; books one of these days. I would be interested in knowing who actually writes them.
B009GEDP26,Nan Smith,5,I chose this season because I have the other four seasons and I love the show....not too fond of Iron Gates but she had some pretty big shoes to fill after Montegomery. It's fun and witty and the banter between all the characters is wonderful.
B009GEDP26,Patricia M. Brown,5,I really like this episode because we get to see Becket and Castle in a romantic setting. The murder puts a damper on their weekend but there are a couple of really steamy scenes in this one. We need more episodes with romance.
B009GEDP26,Polly,5,Just purchased Season 5....can't wait to watch and get caught up before the new Season 6 starts in the fall!!
B009GEDP26,R. Fernatt,5,My wife and I love to watch Castle! It's a great show with both enough comedy and drama to keep you coming back for more.
B009GEDP26,R. McCuistian,5,This show is one of the most entertaining New York detective shows anybody has ever made. It's brilliantly cast and the actors are totally engaging.  Love it!!!
B009GEDP26,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I chose the rating because this is one of my favorite shows. Every episode makes me laugh and keeps me interested. I like the writing and cast for the series. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different to watch.
B009GEDP26,Victoria,5,Castle is one of the best shows out there.  It combines humor and mystery with just the right amount of drama to keep you coming back for more.
B009GEDP26,wanona thomas,5,The story between the two lead actors are amazing and I enjoy so much thank for keeping me interested in the show every week.
B009GEDP26,William R. Smith "Bill Smith",5,The character development and interaction of this detective thriller series make it a delight to watch. My wife and I find it totally delightful.
B009GX69RK,Anna Smith,5,This is the best show ever :) :)  The characters are so funny and refreshing as a cast.  So glad Fox wised up and did not cast a bunch of boring celebrities and instead chose fresh new faces to create this show.5 thumbs up!
B009GX69RK,BrownCoat 96760 "browncoat96760",5,Best comedy since Friends. Good timing. Excellent outside characters. Love the bar setting. And the eventual hook ups bound to happen slowly but the chemistry was definitely was there.Box came a little bruised but whatever all the disc worked just fine so I'll be able to continually watch it so I don't care.Won't give away the coupling but since I haven't been able to handle any comedy since Friends lately this is the one to try out.
B009GX69RK,Jessica R Schley,5,I love this show.  Jess is charming and hilarious - a real goofy but comfortable in her goofiness.  Her roomies are the kind of guys you wish you could really meet at a bar although don't hold your breathe ladies.  This show is amazing.  I laugh out loud at every episode.
B009GX69RK,leinani45 "...:auntykaryn:...",5,I freaking love this show. Such a cute and quirky comedy--it is one of the best of it's kind since Friends!
B009GX69RK,Shannon Thomas,5,If you're looking for deep thoughts look elsewhere but if you want a funny cast and lighthearted entertainment then u need to see this show. The cast knows why you're watching and never tries to make it anything its not. Absolutely worth a look!
B009GX69RK,shelly,5,Makes me laugh out loud every show ! in love with Nick! fancy man 1&2 are my favorites! Thank You!
B009GX69RK,SR,5,Zooey Deschanel is my favorite. She's freaking hilarious and so is the guy that plays Nick Miller. This show makes me laugh so hard!!
B009GX69RK,t2tigger,5,Love the whole premise behind this adorable sitcom.  Great cast with great chemistry to make their crazy situations believable.  I love that the language and even sexual exploits are handled appropriately.
B009GX6F10,1443giggles,3,i dont' hate it but it doesn't quite peak my intrest.  may end up watching it later if i am bored.
B009GX6F10,Amazon Customer,4,I really like this show.  Dennis Quaid plays a sheriff who doesn't follow any of the rules.  He's the kind of sheriff that you wish we had today.
B009GX6F10,azloree,4,Just a fun look at Vegas in 1960.  Mob vs cowboys vs Mormons.  Interesting history in a fictional setting.  Sit back and relax.
B009GX6F10,Bill,5,I like the attention to detail (takes place in the early '60's) on the sets and props. The acting is excellent! My favorite show.
B009GX6F10,chris,5,This brings back memories of the old Vegas. Lots of action and drama. Love the actors. Wish they would not have canceled the show.
B009GX6F10,Craig Miller,3,Like the actors and the storylines are good. I like the early 60's setting along with the styles.. The shows tempo is good.
B009GX6F10,Denn,4,Good honest fun show.  Not Vegas but then what is?  Living in Vegas since 63 I find this to mirror some of Vegas but is candy coated for TV.  Ralph Lamb and his Brother Darwin OWNED this town for 20 years and while Ralph was Sheriff no one screwed up.  They minimized what he actually did to law breakers.  Folks who were thieves were "rumored" to find themselves out at the state line in underpants and nothing else after a VERY long and sound beating.  The Lambs were not everyone's cup of tea but as a law abiding person they took care of the town and no one messed with them.
B009GX6F10,Grandma Buddy,5,This program is fun to watch.  I like the fact that Michael Chiklis plays the bad guy but really isn't that bad.....love his character.
B009GX6F10,jose viveros,5,Why did Vegas not  have more people talking about it?Even my teenagers got into this great show.I would recomend this show to everyone I know.
B009GX6F10,Judy Kazlauskis "JudyK",5,It was better than I expected.  Good acting and really reminiscent of the early days of Vegas.  Now I'm glad I missed it onTV and get to watch it on Prime.
B009GX6F10,luvsminis "mini horse lover",4,dennis quaid is very good in this. i highly recommend it.it brought back a lot memories seeing the old cars in this show.
B009GX6F10,Mam,5,Love the story line.  I am already regretting that this is the only season though that is available I have a feeling it is going to leave me hanging.
B009GX6F10,M. Kennedy,5,Great casting and the storyline becomes more interesting with each episode.  Pulling for the Lamb family and even tolerating the mobster due to his soft side.
B009GX6F10,Nan,5,I have not finished watching this series. My husband and my self really are enjoying it. It is fun to see Vegas as it was when I was there in the 60's.
B009GX6F10,ORURO H.S.,3,The whole story and series was rather dull and predictable. The last five episodes were far more engaging and built up to something but the series was not renewed. The sub stories of a sheriff's romance with a gambling casino moll and the son's romance with a movie starlet were ludicrous and poorly acted. Don't waste your time.
B009GX6F10,pd,5,Great storyline. I love the 50s 60s cars and music. Reconstructed old Fremont Street. Cowboys and Mafia. Very entreating with a great cast. MORE!
B009GX6F10,RJK,5,This was a very action packed drama series.  It had many great actors who played great parts. They kept you on the edge of your seat at all times. It was really worthwhile to watch.
B009GX6F10,S. McDonald,4,This show will surprise you. The  sets are so so 1960's .  The story lines  are modern day. Acting is a bit um b list.. On the whole good show.
B009GX6F10,southerntothecore "richard",3,It is hard to keep my attention. I've seen so many TV Cop shows they all seem to use the same script with some tweaking. This one did come up with a novel theme. So it was more tolerable and entertaining than many-many others.
B009GX6F10,Value Shopper Pensacola,5,I have really enjoyed watching this series.  It is a shame they only made one season.  Thank you for putting it on Amazon Prime.
B009GX6F10,victoria dubiel,5,Great fun to relive the 60s.  The casting is perfect and the writing fantastic!  Vegas at its grittiest.  I hope the story continues.
B009GX6F10,Victoria,5,One of the more compelling new dramas.  I really look forward to watching this show during the week and enjoy the period drama.  The acting is superb.
B009GX6F10,Whomike "Whomike",5,Great series! Great writing! The characters really stay in the 60's focus.I did not watch Vegas until a friend asked me if I was watching and told me how good he thought this series was. It IS extremely good! Dennis Quaid is the perfect actor to portray Sheriff Lamb.I downloaded the whole season (rental) from Amazon for about $19.00. I have one more episode to view. I will surely DVR this series when it returns on cable!
B009GXUMI2,Cyndi W "SipRedWine",4,Private practice keeps things fresh and the story line moving along.  I only wish it was a weekly show!  It was a great spin off from Grey's Anatomy.
B009GXUMI2,Jenny May Shannon,4,This show gets better each season.  I'm so glad that this was available online since my DVR is usually pretty busy!
B009GXUMI2,JT,5,Anyone who likes &#34;Greys Anatomy&#34; will like &#34;Private Practice&#34;. I like that the actors' character roles and personalities and interactions change quite a bit on this show. Quite a variety in scenarios. Is very much a DRAMA- very little humor - some episodes can be a bit intense or tedious
B009GXUMI2,Julianne Knutson,5,I'm glad that Addison found her man! Though it wouldn't be good without some suprising guest reuniting near the ending. :)They did a wonderful job!
B009GXUMI2,Laura,5,I was so sad to see it end. I really liked this show and how they all got along. Sure hope everything works out for the actors.
B009GXUMI2,scent chick,5,I have watched every season!  I truly hate to see this show end!  AWESOME!  I will miss this show next season!
B009HNCUYK,BrownCoat 96760 "browncoat96760",5,Of course I had to buy this particular episode. 300th episode. I've watched the show from day one and remembered the case without even having to watch the original episode.
B009HNCUYK,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,Wonderful and back to crimes! I love it love it love it its great so good it freaks me out
B009HNCUYK,kybrdplyr,5,Beautifully acted and written.  A great celebration of 300 episodes of solid writing and performances.  Bittersweet end with an edge of your seat journey getting there.  Highly recommended.
B009HNCUYK,Mary-Ann "mag89",5,I think this show has been freshened up with the addition of new characters.  Hope it has many more years to run
B009HNCUYK,wanona thomas,5,it's a wonderful show that I would watch all day long I thank the writers for being so created. Thank you for it all
B009HNDCC4,B. Merrill,5,Love Ed Oneil he totally shines in this sitcom. Crazy show that truly depicts how wrong things can go in modern life. Everyone in the show is funny they do an amazing job making you laugh.
B009HNDCC4,Charlotte Roy,5,These characters and their lighthearted machinations keep me laughing and uplifted.  I am thankful for the wit and imagination that the writers and actors gift us with for twenty minutes each week!
B009HNDCC4,Loretta,5,Love the stories. Best show on currently! When will season 5 start? Or is that it? It may have gone to syndication already.
B009HNDCC4,MICHAEL E. ZEHR "Disabled American Veteran",5,Modern Family is such a funny show.  I like how they have taken a family and given 3 different aspects on how family life is.  Don't want to give away to much of the story but I really enjoy all the actors and actresses.  If I am not mistaken I believe the show won an Emmy again this year for best Comedy but not 100% sure because I don't want the Emmys.
B009HNDCC4,TEXAS ROCKS!,1,I actually stopped watching this show. I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought. It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons. A friend told me to give this episode a try. This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time. Still this show has tanked a lot.
B009HNDCC4,zzdb,5,Sometimes as the seasons continue to roll on with sit-coms it can feel that the writers run out of things to do. This series has not fallen into that and continues to be hilarious. The characters continue to be funny and the writing has stayed witty. This show can be enjoyed on many levels.
B009HNDGLG,John,3,I could not watch this all the way through. I gave up on it about half way. Not my cup of tea and I like gay themed movies.
B009HNDGLG,Lynn McBee,4,I was quite impressed by the acting chops of Keough and Temple. The story was interesting and the reactions depicted by the young women were believable. I also thought the special effects were unusual and stimulating. This movie is not for young kids. Older kids may need some guidance when dealing with the subject matter.
B009HONRO6,David Turkheimer,5,I have been in awe of the writers and actors of 30 Rock since the beginning.  They never take the easy way out.  Another great show.
B009HONRO6,joe,5,Many people thing that 30 Rock got canceled. That is not true! Tina Fey wanted to end the seris on a high note. And she defiantly did!
B009HONRO6,R.R.H.,4,Still a great show and ending on a high note but Tina Fey called it right. It was time to go.
B009HX0FM4,B. Merrill,5,The first couple are just ok and later into the show you will crack up. The interactions with alien verses human is so funny. Great comeady for the whole family..
B009HX0FM4,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,The guy who is cast as the 'alien in charge' does great acting.  Supporting cast all do a great job.  The kids do even better.  Very quirky and different.  I highly recommend this show.
B009HX0FM4,R. M "movier",3,I viewed this show on a suggestion from someone and was surprised.It Is different from what I thought and probably won't last long.
B009HX0FM4,Victoria,5,This show is truly funny and brings real laughter to my day.  The cast is incredible and they bring life to their characters.
B009HX0FM4,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,4,Funny but will this show make it?  I get the feeling it won't make it and the season shows are erratic at best.
B009I7VS2K,E. A Dunn "laineyd",5,We really enjoyed Season 2 of Key & Peele and wish the season was longer. Season 1 (especially the first episode) was funnier but we still laugh like crazy at least once per episode.
B009I7VS2K,G. Lett "George",5,Very funny! The new Dave Chapell Show! Real world comedy show that hits all the hot topics that others are afraid to address.
B009I7VS2K,Lorri Robinson,5,Key and peel are hilarious.  They make me laugh.  I saw them first on YouTube. I want more Key and peel
B009I7VS2K,M. Campbell,5,So funny you will pee your pants and laugh some more! Love this show and the 2 comedians that lead the comedy!
B009I7VS2K,PhilDub,5,A direct chappelle rip off in some ways. However they are fresh and funny.  They ride the fine line of racist jokes with a humorous awareness.
B009I7VS2K,Rob Lynn,5,Great !  I end my day each evening with an episode before bed to put a smile on my face and to clear away the daily troubles.
B009I7VS2K,TKT,5,I love this show! One of the funniest on tv! It's also about time for their to be more ethnic diversity in TV comedy!!
B009I7VS2K,V. Aub,4,Very funny series.  It is not usual for me to want to watch a comedy show nowadays but this one is edgy enough to have me addicted.
B009IF63I6,B. Merrill,5,Dont miss this show its crazy funny. Love Ashton thiink he really added to the show. Seriously dude those sandals have to go. Love the ending of the last show. Its like modern family it really needs to be on 3 times a week...
B009IF63I6,Miss Ella,1,This show needs to be cancelled... it's not even funny anymore.  Ashton is an idiot... really can't stand that guy.
B009IF7092,2510cheesecake,5,The show continues to make me laugh every time I watch! The cast is great and the story lines don't disappoint! Loved it since I first saw it - I think I will be a fan until the end!
B009IF7092,Adam Rutledge,5,I got turned onto this show by my wife. Hilarious show. If you like comedy you need to watch this show. I have been catching up on the seasons  with her and haven't see a bad episode yet
B009IF7092,AlwaysWatching,5,This show is without a doubt the funniest show on TV. (Okay that's a bit biased) Maybe only ONE of the funniest shows on TV but it's definitely in the running for Funniest.
B009IF7092,Amazon Customer "Renaissance Man",5,I've watched all six seasons and will watch if add long as it runs!  All of the characters are hilarious!
B009IF7092,amrbilly,5,i cant believe how hook i am in this show. in the begining i thought this show was stupid but i glad i gave another chance to watch it and now i am hook with this show. i cant wait this fall to come back
B009IF7092,Antonio,5,I love the writing on this show but Sheldon is the star!  Nerds will live forever and always get the girls!
B009IF7092,Bradley F. Baker,3,I've watched 5 seasons so why not try the 6th for $8. It's still not good and e story line never develops like other shoes that have been on this long. They really need to shake things up
B009IF7092,Cami=) "Cami=)",5,Love the show! Super funny! Enjoying it whileit lasts! Before they get into telling to deep of stories and it turns into some weird nerdy soap opera......it always happens......
B009IF7092,Chris Schoenrock,5,This show is amazing. Jim Parsons is a comic genius. He continues to get better and better. Maylim Balik is giving him a run for his money.
B009IF7092,Christopher R. Williams,4,Verry good season. loved iti wish they would stray from the relationship stuff and get back to nerdy science stuff more but character progression blah blah blah.
B009IF7092,Dan Hertel,5,this show is side splitting funny thank you for bringing it to my computer. such a funny show very good
B009IF7092,Deacon Blue,5,This is one of those rare shows that makes me laugh out loud often and sends me to YouTube looking for clips of particularly funny scenes.
B009IF7092,Entertainment Aficionado,5,One of the best seasons yet. The cast keeps it fresh and new year after year while digging deeper into the character development.
B009IF7092,flygirltaylor,5,I absolutely love this show and download episodes to my kindle so I can watch them while on long plane rides.  I never get tired of watching these episodes and see the characters evolve. Love it!
B009IF7092,Jeanne Lorance,5,One of my favorite shows.  Sheldon is such a mess and poor Leonard just needs someone to appreciate him.  The writing and characters are so well done
B009IF7092,johnny,5,so funny!! i love this show it is so in tune with realities of life and the humor is very well written
B009IF7092,Lee H.,5,This is a great show!  The characters are just hilarious. We just laugh at all the funny quirks and sci-fi referrences.  It's so funny!!
B009IF7092,Lois,5,Another great series especially when you need a laugh after a hard day a work put on big bang and your laughing alot.  I am so happy this is here so I can put it in and enjoy the fun and laughter....
B009IF7092,Lynn McBee,5,This series has continued to make me laugh out loud. The actors are excellent and stay true to character. It is just a delightful series. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
B009IF7092,M. A. Griffin,5,I have been a big fan from the beginning.  Like the characters who have grown and changed from season to season while still remaining &#34;who they are&#34;.  The humor is fun and not mean.I find myself laughing with the characters and the situation they get themselves into and not at them or someone else.
B009IF7092,M. Engel,5,Well I love this nerdy show. I love that the girls try to get smart to under stand the boys who are super smart but act like 5 yr olds by liking super heros comic books etc.
B009IF7092,M. Naidas,5,Enjoy the series
B009IF7092,Pam Swinson,5,Great comedy just love it. Been a long time since I enjoyed Tv usually watch movies
B009IF7092,Perry,5,One of the best shows on tv for sure. I could watch every episode over and over and still crack up laughing.
B009IF7092,PoohBearsf,5,Got this to help my husband keep his BBT collection growing. We both really enjoy the show and its even better without commercials.
B009IF7092,R. Hartley "Writer's Mind",5,This is my favorite comedy on TV. I love everything about it. These guys are hilarious and very like able.
B009IF7092,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I really like this show. I have The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-5 on DVD. I laugh really hard everytime I watch. I got into this series sometime after it started becoming popular. My mom and I are huge fans of this series.
B009IF7092,S. A. Burke,5,This is our current comedy favorite. The show moves along at a brisk clip. It has boldly added new cast members and has great guest stars. Hope they continue for many more seasons.
B009IF7092,sao,5,I love this show. It is one of the best shows out there in my opinion. It is like the new &#34;Friends&#34;
B009IF7092,Steve Bystrak,5,Best season yet
B009IF7092,Tamara J. Christian,5,This is a family favorite series. The 6th season did not disappoint. It is still as funny and witty as ever.
B009IF7092,Tim,5,Had watched season 6 on tv. This show is still as fresh as first season. Lot of shows crash after a few seasons. It is still fresh. Great gift idea too.
B009IF7092,Woody,5,My wife was happy to recieve the fulll season and now has all of the shows available. It is clear with great sound. Each DVD is nicely placed in each case. Delivered quickly package nicely.
B009IF7Z38,Co-op Granny,4,So far it explains what happened as a result if the crash and shows where and why folks remain at Seattle Grace with some authenticity. It also shows that characters are dealing with new issues and have new status which is valid. And always dealing with emergency and mystery and (painful) humor. And leaves us wondering what is next and how folks will cope!
B009IF7Z38,cutenerd,5,I cant wait for season 10 though I fear the show is nearing the end. It is a great show I just see aspects of it that will lead to the death of the series.
B009IF7Z38,Cyndi W "SipRedWine",5,The writers had a couple episodes where they must have been on brain vacation but the new twists and turns they are putting in are really great.  I wish they had an episode EVERY week!
B009IF7Z38,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,Love this show my daughter got me addicted to it.  It is kinda a soap opera but with way more real life action.
B009IF7Z38,Me,5,Grey's Anatomy still manages to keep the story unexpected and entertaining. I enjoy all episodes!  And am looking forward to this season as well.
B009IF7Z38,P. Sink "Golfer & Teacher",5,I have never watched Grey's Anatomy at it's regular time on Network.  I started watching it from Season 1 on Amazon Instant Video; it totally caputured my attention; I love the show and am glad that it's returning for a 10th Season.
B009IF7Z38,TaydeeBee,5,I've always been a huge Greys fan! I love that even if I miss a week amazon allows me to purchase episode by episode instead of waiting months for the entire season to come out on DVD!
B009IF7Z38,Twilight Mom,5,Grey's Anatomy is my absolute favorite show on television now...I own all the past seasons on my Kindle and have watched them over again.
B009IF7Z38,wanona thomas,5,I love the drama that medicine can serve. In every show it shows me that their are good days and bad days in a life of doctor's and nurses. But in the end it all about the patient's
B009IG59DK,Amazon Customer "Nina",5,Shonda Rhimes writes like nobody else can or ever has on a tv show you never know where the next episode is going because it always goes where you didn't expect.
B009IG59DK,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,I enjoyed the political drama and the great ensemble cast.  The writing is typical to Shonda Rhimes : fast paced and interesting withlots of twists and turns.  Some good acting from all cast members especially &#34;Huck&#34; who suffers from PTSD.  The surprise at the ending was an extra and obviously an opening for season three of the series.
B009IG59DK,B. Merrill,5,This show did a 180 from season 1. Lots more scandal and drama it went from a intresting show to edge of your seat in season 2. I honestly cant wait to see more.
B009IG59DK,charismatic,5,This show is soooo darn good. I had to add it to my series to keep collection. Hope it has More seasons to come
B009IG59DK,dap123,5,This is a fantastic show. Exciting and dramatic. The Fitz and Olivia have amazing chemistry. The secrets revealed about each character are amazing and the intrigue is wonderful. Definitely one of my favorite shows. I hope it continues for several more seasons.
B009IG59DK,EZELLA001,5,I did not miss the complete Season 2 I only purchased one episode; I never miss Scandal but due to a Major Strom or Breaking News I was unable to record one of my favorite series . Thank God for instant video!
B009IG59DK,J. Dean "playagirl",5,Does Shonda Rhimes take genius pills every night??? WTF?!?! This show doesn't stop and delivers EVERY EPISODE! Thanks for such a great show! I'm a scoundrel for Scandal
B009IG59DK,J. Meehan "Naomi",5,I love to watch this show. I get it on my Kindle and watch it. I love the plots and the chatacters. This is a show that is well put together with suberb story lines.
B009IG59DK,Laura,5,This is great. Appears to follow the white house real good. I would recommend for all adults to watch over the age of 18.
B009IG59DK,Miss Berly,5,I. LOVE. THIS. SHOW. If you're not watching this show you are missing out! I will be rewatching this & season 1 before season 3 begins to ease my withdrawal symptoms!
B009IG59DK,Nancy Sutherlin,5,The acting is very good and it shows kinda what a president is caught up in.  It gives you an idea about political messes and how crooked gov. appears.  It has romance and it has tragedy/  The manipulation that seems to go on in politics is very interesting.
B009IG59DK,Patricia Savage,5,I really enjoy this show because of the unusual characters and I like that they wear white hats while being faced with difficult moral choices all of the time.  Interesting show...and those kind of things probably really go on in our political arena.
B009IG59DK,rebma,5,One of the best shows on TV. Can't wait for the new season. You never know what crazy &#34;Scandal&#34; will pop up next.
B009IG59DK,Rene',4,I really enjoyed season one.  So far season two hasn't been too bad.  I love Kerri Washington.  Hope they can keep the stories interesting.
B009IG59DK,Romona C. Bell,5,I never watched this on television but you better believe I will for Season 3.  Just enough intrigue to keep you interested but not confused.
B009IG59DK,R Walsh "R .W.",4,Can't stop watching this show.  Show has excellent writing and acting. Show's political subject is very unique. Caution: This show is extremely addictive.
B009IG59DK,S. Gonzales "PoleCat",5,I've been watching this season 2 at work during my lunch and everyone laughs because I yelling at the computer.  So far this season is AMAZING
B009IG59DK,SLS,5,I never realized how easy it was to order movies or tv episodes off of Amazon to download directly to my Amazon site.  I will not hesitate to do it again.
B009IG59DK,Victoria R. Brown,5,I absolutely love this show.  It is a credit to television.  Can't wait until Thursday nights to watch.  Everyone I know is into thsi show.
B009IG59DK,whocares,5,Another suspenseful season! Good show! keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering how true it really is about what goes on in DC
B009IJJ5B4,Annette Radocaj "Annette",5,What a great adaptation of a classic character and his introduction into the modern world. The rapport between the two stars is fantastic. The cases are clever as only Holmes' should be and the 2nd series should be just as good
B009IJJ5B4,BenGray,5,I love lucy in anything I've seen her in. This character has a lot of depth and I like the process of peeling the onions back on these two.
B009IJJ5B4,B. Merrill,5,This is a great show. Love the interation between Watson and Sherlock. I never can wait to see the next episode.
B009IJJ5B4,Chris St Pierre,5,What a connection these two actors share. The chemistry and performance of them both offer a truly tantalizing version of our Mr. Holmes. To have it based in the USA was a clever twist and only adds to the show's vibrancy.
B009IJJ5B4,claiib,4,I think that this is a smart twist to the original Sherlock homes. I really enjoy the interacts and discoveries you make along the way in each episode. It is smartly written and fun to watch. For those fans dedicated to the original a woman Watson and a tattooed Holms maybe to big of a jump of transition. All in all I like the show and look forward to continuing to watch.
B009IJJ5B4,Deborah R. Painchaud "De Pa",2,Too boring for words...the whole thing fell flat from beginning to end and I amazed I even got to the end or did I? Forgettable to say the least.
B009IJJ5B4,Denise Saniewski,5,This is a great take on the original Holmes stories.  The acting is great!  I look forward to seeing it every week.
B009IJJ5B4,dog lover,4,We enjoyed the first episode but will wait until we don't have to purchase it to watch the entire season.
B009IJJ5B4,Donna Regan,5,The BBC series Sherlock proved Doyle's character could translate to current times and reach new audiences.  Elementary proves the same thing in New York.  Sherlock Holmes has always been a nuanced and layered character and Johnny Lee Miller is very good at keeping him interesting.  Lucy Liu stuns and gives Watson more depth than the character has ever had before. Great fun and enjoyable.
B009IJJ5B4,DP,5,I hope this show runs for another 5 years!! They are excellent together.
B009IJJ5B4,Edward H. Bell,5,We Loved this series. The on screen dynamic of Holmes and Watson is fresh and most enticing. Great to see a female Watson as companion. The stories are fresh and Moriarty is an interesting and refreshing twist on the usual villain.
B009IJJ5B4,EGOlsen,5,After a couple of episodes Sherlock really began to emote which was something missing in the first episodes. Watson is good and getting more believable. Great story line. Love it
B009IJJ5B4,Eugene Gutierrez,5,The purists might not like this show (Watson is a girl in this version) but it is well-produced.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu have a good chemistry.  While British Sherlock shows are pretty good there aren't enough of them produced within a year for a hungry mystery-loving audience.  The complete season is worth purchasing.
B009IJJ5B4,James Brittain "Jim Briton",5,The series keeps you intrigued and the relationship between Sherlock and Holmes is great. I'd recommend it for those who like mystery and subtle humor.
B009IJJ5B4,jim,4,I like holmes and Watson in this new addition to the A C Doyle and have read many of the novels and seeing it in the present with the ideas of the original it nice and fun to see
B009IJJ5B4,Judith A. Chandler,4,Interesting take on Sherlock.  Love Watson!!  Not sure about Sherlock he's just a bit too disordered. Again watch it for Watson
B009IJJ5B4,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,For eight years I have been a Bones fan and five for Castle.  This out does both of them.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be pround of the writers.
B009IJJ5B4,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,I love this show it is part too detective work and part comedy.  Look forward to it every week.  I buy it on amazon.com weekly
B009IJJ5B4,Lawrence Jackson,4,An interesting take off of Arthur Conan Doyle detective. And who does not like Lucy Lu. Where are all these crime fighters in real life?
B009IJJ5B4,Leon J. Lee,5,Lucy Liu makes the show wonderful. She is wonderful and gives the show balance. She should have a stronger part
B009IJJ5B4,Lindalee Ausejo,5,Elementary is another one of the American tv programs which I admire. I plan to collect them all. I hope it continues for years.
B009IJJ5B4,mary ruth,5,We are enjoying this amazing series. Sherlock is cast perfectly with Jonny Lee Miller. The choice for a Doctor Watson was a surprise in many ways but Lucy Lui has been quite interesting in this role and has proven to us that she is the perfect choice for Watson as well.we look forward to every show and it is a &#34;do not miss&#34; for us.
B009IJJ5B4,Michael A. Jolley,4,I like a good mystery story and this one hits the spot.  It's fast paced and the characters click together.
B009IJJ5B4,michele symonette,5,The characters grow and evolve. it's not an just plug in a new villain same ole formula show. I enjoyed it enough that I have bought the tv pass for season 2
B009IJJ5B4,MNMJFoley,4,Always liked him - since Hackers. He plays an emotionally stunted Sherlock perfectly and the plots are very interesting. Character development is a bit slow but it raises the audience's curiosity into his past. Not crazy about Lucy Lu - never smiles and is a bit too cold.
B009IJJ5B4,M. Skiles "r_vin",5,This show is really smart and entertaining.  I enjoy the characters and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys police procedurals.
B009IJJ5B4,Nance,5,This is a fresh concept on the Sherlock Holmes series.  Jonny Lee Miller [Trainspotting] is great as Holmes with Watsonre-imagined as a female [Lucy Lui].  The two actors seem like an odd couple but blend seamlessly.  Very good show.
B009IJJ5B4,Nancy E. Gallagher,4,Interesting twist on one of my favorite stories.  The updated characters are good and I look forward to more episodes.
B009IJJ5B4,Neil Bergman,4,This is a nice updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Watson. It has good stories and is well acted -- an enjoyable TV show.
B009IJJ5B4,Pam Wiedenfeld "Comparison Shopper",5,I love Lucy and they make a great team!  It's a little predictable but still entertaining and do look forward to watching it each week.  I'm also glad that it has more than 13 episodes to a season.
B009IJJ5B4,pj ellen,5,I missed this program one night and downloaded it to my Kindle to watch.  I love this program and hope it stays on the air for a while.
B009IJJ5B4,pops95b,5,I love this adaptation of the classic Sherlock Holmes. Warning: it is not for those who only enjoy the traditional view of Sherlock but I really enjoy it!
B009IJJ5B4,Powerhouse,5,I have not watched the season on DVD but have caught every episode.  Love the series and look forward to it.
B009IJJ5B4,Ray L. Babcock "Brooks on Golf",5,I am following this new show with great anticipation and interest.  The acting is excellent and the storylines are unique - definately the twists and turns you'd expect from a good Sherlock Holmes story.  I watch the shows again and again.
B009IJJ5B4,Rextafier,5,This is a great show. I have injoyed this new show with great character mix. I would love to see this show continue.
B009IJJ5B4,Riley Harper,5,I think I've watched every episode of this series and have found it to be entertaining and I love the characters. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the updated Sherlock Holmes and Watson but Lucy Liu is wonderful and Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as the modern day Sherlock Holmes. As another reviewer stated I am SO SICK of so-called "reality" tv shows it's refreshing to find television can still be well written and acted and fun to watch!
B009IJJ5B4,Ronda Pennycuff,5,The show is a well written. The show has a good cast. I like this show because it is a modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B009IJJ5B4,SarahV,5,I love this version of Sherlock Holmes.  Jonny does an excellent job with this character and I equally love Lucy portrayal ofWatson.  I also appreciate her credentials as a doctor.  Their chemistry together is exciting to watch.  I am looking forward to the next season.
B009IJJ5B4,Saskia L. Cohick,5,This is a wonderful show.  It is great to see a totally new show with such wonderful acting and writing.  So often on network TV you don't get that combination.
B009IJJ5B4,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",5,One of the few shows we found we waited for each week. We don't watch a lot of tv but my husband and I organized our schedules around both being home and awake to see this. I really like the Aidan Quinn  and the cops.
B009IJJ5B4,S. Wallace,3,If you like Sherlock Holmes you will probably watch this.  I liked it but it's not close enough to what I think Holmes and Watson should be like.  I will probably watch episode 2 just to see if it gets better.  Make up your own mind.
B009IJJ5B4,S. Warren,5,Love the drama between the 2 actors and the direction their life is leading them while they themselves are trying to get over the past that haunts them.
B009IJJ5B4,Tracy A. Peterson,5,I love the idea of Sherlock in New York and I especially enjoy Lucy Lu as Dr. Watson.  Great purchase.  A+++Super fast shipment.
B009IJJ5B4,William Hodges,5,This is on par with NCIS in my opinion. The acting is very good and the plots interesting.I do hope they keep the show for another season.
B009IJJ5B4,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",5,I was skeptical of this when it started because I LOVE the BBC Sherlock series and thought this would be a knockoff. It really is a different take on the idea that doesn't (at least in my mind) conflict at all with the BBC version. I love them both and this show is off to a really great start.
B009JARQ3G,A. M. Bonito,5,I've liked this from the beginning and am on my last episode in the fifth season. I am sorry it is no longer on the air.
B009JARQ3G,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,I really like this entire series so I was not let down in this fifth season.The surprises kept coming and the original team appearing again was amazingGot to see more if more are on the way
B009JARQ3G,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,4,This season starts with more questions than answers and it starts a bit slow and at least two episodes in the show i would say are pure filler however the rest are amazing since u can see that the human losses are taking there toll on our heroes. Still the ending leaves you with a sense that there is hope even in our darkest hours if we are strong and brave enough to find it.
B009JARQ3G,Barbara G. Michonski,5,Fringe is such a great show. It always keep me guessing and being a detective (sci-fi) show with a little comedy too is great!
B009JARQ3G,Bash,4,This Ep was slow for action but filled story line requirements of materialsfor getting rid of the Observers. The rocks recovered had a price of life butstill unknown how they fit in.The actors did a good job but episode kind of draggedon with little learned about how we get to the final.
B009JARQ3G,Big John MacK,5,The whole series is great providing you ARE PREPARED TYO THINK CAREFULLY OTHERWISE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ALL THE PLOT TWISTS
B009JARQ3G,Carole Dyer,5,This was a pretty good ending to the series.  I don't want to say why it was not the greatest ending for me because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  It's definitely worth the wait.
B009JARQ3G,Carol J. Wooldridge,5,love this show and have collected each season. sorry it had to end and all fans should add this final season to their collection
B009JARQ3G,Dawna324,4,The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I have not seen the last 2 episodes but I am sure the rating will be a 5 star once I have seen them. The series ended too soon for me. Would be cool if the 5 main stars could have a spin off where they work independantly of the Government.
B009JARQ3G,D. Greene "pooh",4,This show turned out to be quite an entertaining show. Loved the characters and it wound up with a good ending too!
B009JARQ3G,Donna,5,I have really been enjoying rewatching the final season of Fringe.  I had been wanting to see it again and was delighted to see it on amazon.
B009JARQ3G,Dr J,5,We all love a good story where the subjects live happily ever after.  Walter ended up just where he belonged.
B009JARQ3G,Edward H. Bell,5,I truly enjoyed the entire 5 seasons. Great family scifi adventure. I watched it as a Prime member so it was always available to me and I was able to view all of the seasons in sequence.
B009JARQ3G,Gina,5,I'm sorry to see this show go off the air!!!  This has been one of the most exciting series I've seen in a while.
B009JARQ3G,GKJ,5,This is a real think outside the box show. Science fiction at it's finest (or is it fiction) hummm! I avoided watching this show for a couple of seasons. Then purchased the first season from Amazon and I was hooked. It is a weird show which I think makes it all the better! ;-)
B009JARQ3G,GoPrime,5,Once you start the series you won't want to stop.  It is great that this last season was done so we weren't left hanging.
B009JARQ3G,Inga Wuerges "FlyGirl",5,Only too sad it ended.  Was quite dissapointed with the ending as well.  The show started pretty strong and seriously dwindled towards the end.  Still one of the best shows out there
B009JARQ3G,Joe   L. "Joe L.",4,I am glad they wrapped up the observers but paying for this season kind of hurt. The 4th season was the best.
B009JARQ3G,Judith A. Kling "JKling",5,This was a great season. I binge watched multiple episodes at a time. I have really enjoyed this series and the series' final season did not disappoint.
B009JARQ3G,Judith "Judith Beck",4,The characters are funny and yet serious when stuff comes up. I like the idea of 2 universes. It seems possible but maybe some of it was not believable. If you like time travel and duel universe situations this is the show for you. I enjoyed it.
B009JARQ3G,Keisha L. Jones,4,Again with the sci-fi.  This one was an interesting take on doppelgangers and alternate worlds. I would have watch more seasons if they had been available.
B009JARQ3G,KELLY MCCRADIC,5,It seemed a bit cheesey about first but by the end of the first season I was hooked on what they would discover next and if Peter would finally get his girl :) Great show...
B009JARQ3G,kevin m love,5,Great cast writing and the stories are unique.  You can't get much better than this.  The fact that the show was on five years and never let its quality drop is outstanding.  I'll miss it
B009JARQ3G,L.J. Brown,5,I have all the season's now of Fringe I can tell you if you like the strange and weird you will love this serious my only sorrow is that it stopped at 5 seasons.
B009JARQ3G,Lori "lolepere",4,I was happy that they summed up everything in the end and I'm sooo happy that I bought Amazon Prime because I forgot some of the characters and I could go back to review what I needed to know
B009JARQ3G,Lynne A. James "Lynne",5,Fantastic Series. Each episode is amazing and thought-provoking. I could watch this episode again and again! The characters jump out of the screen and into your life and the story lines remain in your mind for days!
B009JARQ3G,Lynn McBee,5,Enjoyed the whole run of the series. Good ending to the shows. I really enjoyed the acting and the stories.
B009JARQ3G,michaelaen_37841,5,I love this show if you like the syfi stuff this is a must they explore eveything and even things that you dont think of they do its great
B009JARQ3G,MNMJFoley,5,One of the best shows around. Thoughtful and intelligent. Stretches the imagination in a believable way. Wish there were more shows like this!
B009JARQ3G,Money_Maker,4,This is a lil different but not much. Something to watch to pass the time with other than that its another SciFi movie
B009JARQ3G,Nick,5,first of all if you have come this far you know what a wonderful experience fringe has been for all of us season five is more of the same
B009JARQ3G,norma jean kringer,5,I loved this series and now that I have it all I can only wish there was more of it.  But the old saying goes &#34;always leave them laughing&#34; definitely applies here.  Glad to have 5 years of &#34;Fringe&#34;.
B009JARQ3G,Northerngal,5,This is one of the "better" series I have EVER seen on television.  I just watched the last episode and I'm sorry there aren't going to be more.  Excellent acting.
B009JARQ3G,Pat Etzwiler,5,One of the best series on TV in a long time. Only wish that they would produce more SiFi like this show.
B009JARQ3G,Patrick R Smith,5,I Love the plot line and it had me on the edge of my seat what a ride. ya i love it
B009JARQ3G,P. Sink "Golfer & Teacher",5,I will miss Fringe -- the final season has been great!  That's all that I have to say -- enjoyable
B009JARQ3G,Pulpman,5,After watching all 5 seasons in a row all I can say to all involved is Thanks for the ride. This is one of the best shows that ever hit tv. Great stories interesting characters and 5 seasons worth to treasure. The show's last season is a great way to end the show. I really believe that next to Battlestar Galactica that Fringe also hit new highs in the sci fi genre. As always the best shows havew the best drama. Well done  tv at it's best.
B009JARQ3G,Rhonda L. Bennett,5,Fringe wa by far my favorite TV series.  I truly enjoyed it!  I hope they continue with another season!!! It was a great tv series.
B009JARQ3G,Robert A. Giunta "HalfWalker",5,Almost physics and a believable love story make this fun to watch. Series gets progressively better as seasons move forward.
B009JARQ3G,ROY,5,The last and final season was the best as it showed after all the things that went wrong and went right finally ended with this season and I enjoyed it very much.
B009JARQ3G,Sue Boyle "blue9244",5,I so loved this great series and will miss the characters.  I wish they'd gone on and on but do watch it.  I thought was wonderful!
B009JARQ3G,tigerfire2002,5,So everything finally comes together. It's great to see storylines from Season 1 being used during this season. And it wraps things up nicely.
B009JARQ3G,Triciatx,5,I love all of the Fringe Seasons.  I didn't want it to end!  Great Syfy adventures! Recommend it to any SyFy addict!
B009JARQ3G,Trunkneck,5,Best show in some time to hit the airwaves. I just wish they had continued this for another ten seasons.
B009JARQ3G,Ucrazy!,5,This is one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time.  The character development is very very good.  It makes you feel connected to the action.  I am sooo sad it's over!
B009JARQ3G,Varun,5,This show is my favorite sci-fi show. This is very well acted and few of the concepts are eye opener.
B009JZSKRM,Heather Hintz,4,I enjoyed every episode. Very consistent with the characters. Definitely worth watching. I wish there wasn't a max number of words for these reviews.
B009JZTOG8,A. Fast,4,This was purchased for a family member as a gift.They loved it and await the next season &#34;gift&#34; as they watch the series.
B009JZTOG8,AzLou,5,Season 2 follows the interesting story lines of Season 1. Love it! I am already a fan of this series.
B009JZTOG8,briana tarango "Briana Tarango",5,I just love this tv show it takes you to a whole new world with magic and good vs evil.
B009JZTOG8,Brittani,5,This is such a great show! We love the classic background that is incorporated into every day modern life! It is a very original storyline and very addicting!
B009JZTOG8,Brittany Thompson,5,A lot of people are saying this show got silly but I really like it. It has captain hook and mulan in it which most people see that as a story instead of a fairytale but I love the way it's intertwined. It's not as good as season one but still worth the watch to me.
B009JZTOG8,Carol C. MacLeod,5,This show is fantastic! I am always amazed at what they do and how everything is so entwined. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us!
B009JZTOG8,Cindy Powell~Herzog,5,This little sleeper Once Upon a Time was such a surprise to me. I watched the pilot because I liked the actors. I fell in love with the series because they work so well together.Keep up the good work...
B009JZTOG8,Colleen,5,I resisted watching this series because I never took the time to watch from the beginning!  I really think they do a good job with it- the characters are engaging and it creates nice plots and twists.  I have been pleasantly surprised- even shocked at how much I have enjoyed Season 1 and 2.
B009JZTOG8,Cyndi W "SipRedWine",3,Season one was better.  It seems like the writers are getting desperate to find to angles and twists.  This show should have been a one hit wonder making us want more instead of wishing we hadn't bought the whole season!
B009JZTOG8,David B Pyl,5,This is not a show for everyone. If you like fairy tales with twist this would be a show for you. For me it captures my thoughts and makes me think.
B009JZTOG8,Deborah Minyard,5,I really really really hated this show to end. This was one the whole family enjoyed together. Wish there was more like this one.
B009JZTOG8,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,This show is one of my favorites of the last ten years. Few shows make me sorry when the episode ends. This is one of those shows. Each episode is so gripping for me. I love the way the characters and the plots unfold. It's magical.
B009JZTOG8,Devan Shane,5,what a great show full of magic.. cannot wait until it's released on blu ray.. the first season looked great in high def..
B009JZTOG8,Gwen M McDole,5,I love this show.  It's fun to watch. I have enjoyed season two as much as I enjoyed season one.
B009JZTOG8,Heather P. Fraser,5,I am completely addicted to this show.  I can't wait to see the next episode.  Interesting to see the spin these writers put to our classic fairytales.
B009JZTOG8,Ioice,5,I just so happened to fall in love with this tv show during the first season and pre-ordered the second!! It's an inventive re-imagining of all the old fairy tales that have become common knowledge. Its got great acting and exceptional plot twists and it's great to watch upbeat tv again!!! I love it and can't wait for the third season!!
B009JZTOG8,Jim Martin,2,There should have never been a second season as far as I am concerned. Season one should have ended with and they lived happily everafter just like the fairy tale.
B009JZTOG8,Jodel,5,This series continues to turn our childhood fairy tales on their ear.  It's a continual surprise to see what the writers have in store for the audience.  The plots are as twisted as a ball of tangled yarn resulting in surprise after surprise.
B009JZTOG8,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",4,This show has potential but I fear they are writing themselves out of a series rather quickly from the way this series ends.
B009JZTOG8,KELLY MCCRADIC,5,Love this show. The childhood anticipation is eat at to see who will show up next while the unique storylines tie them all together satisfies the adult viewer in me.
B009JZTOG8,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,This show is one of my favorites also.  I purchase them so I can watch when i am able to.
B009JZTOG8,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",5,I guess I'm still a kid at 71 years old but I love this series. I really think it's aimed at an adult audience not really for small children.
B009JZTOG8,nelly123,5,I would recommend this to anyone who has watched the first season it  carries on the storyline and is great watching love all the characters
B009JZTOG8,Nick,5,I love watching Once Upon a time both on amazon and on TV every night and hope that the show would move on to a third season.
B009JZTOG8,NormaJean James,4,I liked this series better during the first season.  Season 2 was more confusing as it moved rapidly between times and worlds.  It was hard to keep track of the story.
B009JZTOG8,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I have recently become a fan of this series. I gave the rating because this series has a great ensemble cast and really good writing. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of any shows like this one.
B009JZTOG8,Ruby,5,I love this show!  Bringing back the children's stories with an modern twist is just fascinating to watch. Most of us have a history with the children's story and when you add &#34;today's&#34; portion of the story and move back and forth through time to create an ongoing story it is fascinating.  You need to watch two episodes and you will be hooked.
B009JZTOG8,samintochess,5,I have to find out if the characters ever get restored to their homes and life in the enchanted forest.
B009JZTOG8,Shannon Castleberry,5,I love this show. It is refreshing and has just enough drama that the whole family can watch with some limitations for younger children. It is fun and a nice take on all the fairy tales and their characters.
B009JZTOG8,StacyR,5,I continue to enjoy the re-telling of fairy tales with a modern twist - fabulous scenery and special effect - love the wolf girl!
B009JZTOG8,S. Warren,4,I read the background on this series and though oook.  Turned out to be entertaining.  The twists and sometimes mysteries to the story pull the viewer in.
B009JZTOG8,The Currdog,5,&#34;Once Upon a Time&#34; takes me to a place in my mind that I like to visit from time to time.
B009JZTOG8,Theresa Lepiane "Theresa",5,If you loved Heroes or Firefly... You will love this.  See Disney characters--both villairns and heroes in a whole new light.  A marvelous mixture of fantasy and the real world.
B009JZTOG8,Tracy A. Peterson,5,This is a great series.  I hope they keep it on the air a long time.  Super fast shipping.  Extremely pleased with entire purchase.A++++
B009JZTOG8,TW,4,They'll love the second season. And looks like a 3rd season is in the works This could go a few seasons more from the looks of it. As far as fantasy show's this is in the Top 3 or 5 for some. My wife loves it.
B009JZTOG8,Vaness1233,5,Started watching this show in its second season and am hooked! Fresh new spin on classic fairytale stories you grew up listening to
B009K0OL06,1443giggles,5,really great show.  keeps you on the tips of your toes wanting more.  I love it and will continue watching.
B009K0OL06,Amazon Customer,5,revenge two is a very exciting season . this last episode and what happened to Amanda and jack. so sorry for Emily.
B009K0OL06,bannaner,5,I recently saw season 1 and I was hooked. I love all the characters especially Gabriel Mann. His witty one liners have me coming back each week.
B009K0OL06,B. Hamlin,5,One of  the things I love about this show is that each episode never fails to intrigue and leaves you wanting more.
B009K0OL06,Cindy Powell~Herzog,5,Revenge from the pilot episode has been on the edge of your seat riveting LOVE ITCant wait for the next showing
B009K0OL06,Craig Louis Webber,5,DYNASTY AND NIKKITA WRAPPED TOGETGER! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WATCHING THIS SERIES! ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING FROM BEGINNING TO END! GREAT!
B009K0OL06,cutenerd,5,This is my favorite show. I love how complex the plot gets. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009K0OL06,Cyndi W "SipRedWine",5,I can never guess what is going to happen next.  The writers are great at building in sneaky twists and turns to always keep you guessing.  The sets are amazing too!
B009K0OL06,Debra Cook,5,I have only watched only Episode of this season so far.  It was really a good show in the first season and I think the second season will be even better.
B009K0OL06,Elizabeth Vinson,5,Purchased this before I found out I could view on hulu! The quality of the programs on Amazon is excellent and if you can spend the extra money its nice not to have all the commercials.
B009K0OL06,Ellie,3,Revenge Season 1 was very good but Season 2 is getting complicated with so many characters and everyone is plotting againsteach other.  It's becoming less real.
B009K0OL06,fredd,4,Wife really enjoys it. I like it enough to watch it with her and be entertained. A couples must see.
B009K0OL06,Fred D. Lewis "Derf8me",5,It's like a murder mystery wrapped in an espionage mystery with Amanda Clarke pursuing her revenge plot and headed straight for an international conspiracy.
B009K0OL06,goldenbear5,5,What can I say...I haven't missed an episode yet. I hate those Graysons :) and love seeing what Amber is going to do next.
B009K0OL06,Isabeau,5,Well worth your time if you like drama with a touch of action and suspense.  This series is a keeper.
B009K0OL06,J Day,5,This show has been nicely put together.  Just when you think it's going to be okay something else happens.  We love watching the season unfold.  There is so much betrayal; it's hard to even see half of it coming.  The plot is about a young woman who wants revenge for the atrocities that were made against her father.  She wants nothing more than revenge.  Sometimes she has a heart but that just gets in the way.  The other characters are mostly just awful people getting what they deserve.  She is good!  Her best friend is quirky and has a great character as well.
B009K0OL06,J. E. Ramsey "Jeram",5,Revenge is back and better than ever. I love this show. I pined all summer for this show. It was definitely worth the wait!!
B009K0OL06,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,this is a great show and I enjoy watching it.  Suspenseful and just a great show.  Such a mix of characters.
B009K0OL06,Laura,5,I love this series. I have the first season and the second season is a good as the first one.
B009K0OL06,nelly123,5,I would recommend this to anyone who has seen season one the storylines keep you hanging I love the series and the actors are great
B009K0OL06,neon,5,Actors and actresses blend well together Edge of your seat addictive Thriller.What Happens next Hope the seasons keep coming along
B009K0OL06,Paul Jonathan Wells,5,This show is simply amazing and the picture/audio quality is first class.  I absolutely love the convenience and dependability of amazon instant video and I am proud to be a valued customer.  I would recommend this product to any and all fans of the show.  It saves the time of waiting on a DVD purchase.
B009K0OL06,R. A. Macgaren,5,I love this show and there is so much going on that i want to rewatch them to pick up on the things I missed the first time around.
B009K0OL06,rgoodi,5,This show is great. I talk about the character with my wife when we aren't watching. I don't do that about any other show. Great!
B009K0OL06,Rich,5,Love Emily in this roll. Season three has gone astray. I hope they get back to the plots and how she carries them out. This year it's as though she isn't in charge and I don't like that. Maybe they'll get back to what made the show so famous. They need to kill off either Daniel or Charlie!
B009K0OL06,Roberta Hodges,5,I purchased this for my sister. She was sick and missed a show so I bought this show for her to catch up.
B009K0OL06,R Walsh "R .W.",4,Character's are clever and unique. Really enjoyed the acting and screen writing.  Look forward to next season. Very interesting. well done.
B009K0OL06,Sewpippy "I love to read both fiction and non...,4,I am enjoying the series but not sure where the story line will take us or if it will get so convoluted that my interest will wain - will see.
B009K0OL06,SoCal Mom,5,Dramatic surprising.. fascinating &#34;theatre&#34;... intriguing characters. both evil and mixed...setting also unusual .. costuming wonderful.. always a new twist from week to week....a good tv show all around...
B009K0OL06,Stephen P.,2,I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second.  It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left.  Or maybe they just ran out of things to say.  Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed.  Looks like I have to find a new favorite show.
B009K0OL06,Tammie Hurst,5,I can't get enough of the characters and show.  I have watched this season and last season many times and now I can watch it anytime I want and as often as I want.
B009K0OL06,Terry S Thomas,5,This season is Awesome!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Like the show Dallas in the 80's.
B009K0OL06,Tom Stevenson,5,Fantastic movie.  I love the story line and the characters are all strong and you just never see the next curve coming.  I would like to see more shows like this on Amazon Instant.
B009K0OL06,Vaness1233,5,One of the best shows on tv right now. Love the acting and storylines. Good suspense and acting from all
B009K0OL06,V. Durost,5,Emily continues down her path to clear her father's name and is letting nothing get in her way!  One of the better shows on Television!!
B009K0OL06,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,5,I have purchase both seasons so far and I really enjoy watching them over and over again.  I can't wait for the third season to start.
B009K0OL06,Zig Meyer,5,Can't wait to see what happens next!  I love the characters and the plot twists!  It's a keeper for me!
B009K0ZGJQ,Amazon Customer,4,I and my wife are enjoying watching these. We can hardly wait to get through them to see what happens next.
B009K0ZGJQ,Amazon Customer,5,This show is extremely well written - each character has been not only well written but the actors are great.  If you haven't seen this series - try it!  You will love it.
B009K0ZGJQ,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,4,great show but the price its a bit too much for a dvd collection considering this series should be release on bluray.
B009K0ZGJQ,Book Lover "CYN",5,Patrick Jane returns with his co-workers at CBI for the fifth season. I think this is the best season yet. I love to watch Patrick Jane watch the guilty and finally get the truth out of them. It is a great DVD set and I highly recommend it.
B009K0ZGJQ,Christopher Rech,5,The Mentalist is an awesome show! I absolutely love the fifth season of the show!! I hope that the writers can keep up the great job that they are doing! The cast is wonderful as well as the stories!
B009K0ZGJQ,Douglas Deicke,4,This show is very good because I have always enjoyed cop-consultant shows. The Mentalist mainly focuses on Patrick Jane finding out who the serial killer known as Red John really is and trying his best to capture or kill him. He also helps the CBI with other cases by using his keen sense of observation with victims or suspects.
B009K0ZGJQ,Dwight,2,every one has their personality and sticks to it - but are all very moral decent peoplethe good thing if you watch on a regular basis - is that you see the ancillary California communities as the locationsthe best thing was Bradley Whitford's episode and the next best thing is Morena Baccarin's episode otherwise I found these episodes to be really horrible.
B009K0ZGJQ,Elisha C. Douglas,5,I love that it keeps us guessing about red john.  its not cut and dried.  would love to see teresa and jane get together on thedown low...
B009K0ZGJQ,Gary D. Groves,4,Had to purchase the episode because this was one that wasn't available by demand from our cable company.  Generally a pretty good series.  One of the detectives has been pregnant and has gained weight.  I have missed any references to this pregnancy situation.
B009K0ZGJQ,Gayle A Matthews,5,Highly recommended to all who love watching Simon Baker!  You'll enjoy this season especially the last episode.  I can't wait for the next!
B009K0ZGJQ,hobbles,5,I didn't think I'd like this show but I'm hooked. Even if just to look at Simon I watched his other series the guardian it didn't last long this ones much better
B009K0ZGJQ,Kentucky D. "Uncle D.",5,The &#34;assistant&#34; Patrick Jane has more than six senses and is very heady in every situation. This is MUST HAVE series because every single segment is so original and entertaining simply because Jane is so smart and intuitive.
B009K0ZGJQ,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,I have a few shows on Amazon that I purchase every week this is one of them.  I love to watch them over and over.
B009K0ZGJQ,kybrdplyr,5,The horrific nature of the featured crime belies the loneliness that grows heartbreakingly deeper for "The Mentalist."  An episode worth watching to the very end.3 Star:  the episodes in this season are strangely flat.  There is none of the vivid tension of the Red John journey that Patrick Jane has taken in the past.  Just watched "Little Red Corvette" and the lack of context that would make returning a child to his parent so poignant results in an anticlimactic conclusion.
B009K0ZGJQ,Linda Smith "Ellis",5,I can't think of anyone who could play Patrick Jane except Simon Baker! This is a great show! I think the acting and writing are superb.
B009K0ZGJQ,LuvJewels,5,Clear dynamic presentation in HD.  No commercials and stereo sound round out an enjoyable presentation.  I will use the rental of episodes in the future as the need arises.
B009K0ZGJQ,MacGyver's "Swiss Army Knife",4,Patrick Jane does it again.  I loved the smack down at the end where he tells her exactly why she did.  I did figure out what was in the box.  Gross!
B009K0ZGJQ,nelly123,5,I love this series I am so hooked the storyline with red john is so interesting he is always one step ahead so cant wait to find out who it is would recommend to anyone
B009K0ZGJQ,Patricia Savage,5,I absolutely love everything about this show and everyone involved in this series.  It is the best in every respect.
B009K0ZGJQ,Perry,5,The Mentalist is definitely one of my favorite shows and so good that's it's been on for so many seasons. We got backed up on season 5 due to various reasons and are DVR got backed up and missed the first half of this season so trying to get caught back up. We started watching recently and I remembered how much I love this show.
B009K0ZGJQ,Powerhouse,4,I bought this as a gift for my dad and he enjoys it.  He loves the show and he often watches old episodes.
B009K0ZGJQ,R. Fernatt,5,My wife and I are fans of the Mentalist and have been following along since Season 1. It's a clever show with good chemistry between the characters. We also appreciate that it doesn't need to use foul language every other word or extreme gore or violence to make the show work.
B009K0ZGJQ,Stormy,4,Easy to watch and follow as an evening bit of tellie - not intellectually rigorous or particularly deep - but that is OK. Decent plots and character development though the reach of the nefarious &#34;Red John&#34; is unfathomably deep. Worth watching.
B009K0ZGJQ,susan,4,not even sure what its about but it must be a good one maybe on prime or something ill be watching to see what hes liking
B009K0ZGJQ,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",4,and the rest of the cast are just so endearing. I really didn't want to like this show. I didn't want to like Simon Baker. I don't watch this with anyone else in my family it is something of a guilty pleasure.
B009K0ZGJQ,Vivian A. Robaldo "Viv",5,Just love this actor and the complete cast assemble.  It's an excellent idea and every week look forward to the new program
B009K0ZGJQ,Whomike "Whomike",5,I love &#34;The Mentalist&#34;.It is a well written show and the acting is NOT over the top-- you know how some shows seem to be trying to be &#34;cool&#34; or &#34;scary&#34; or really &#34;with it?&#34; That is getting old in my opinion.Not so with Patrick Jane and agent Lisbon- You can start watching this series anytime and really enjoy it. It has a smooth feel and does not attempt to confuse you or make you guess. It is just a well written and acted series.Thumbs UP!!
B009K0ZGJQ,William Hodges,5,I loved Simon in the Guardian and he just seems to get better and better with each show. I do hope there will be a 6th season.
B009K0ZLIM,H. A. Hinrichs,5,This story line/show has such an complex and mysterious plot to it.  I am enjoying it very much as Jane tries to discover the hidden aspects of the Drake and of her past.  I'd run like a scared rabbit if it was me.
B009K0ZLIM,Wendy Pullins,5,This show is truly spooky! It gets more shocking with every episode. I love the actors. Love the twists and turns!
B009K72EP8,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,One of the best seasons yet full of action and events that set revenge of the sith in motion. Amazing animation and storyline as well as the duels are intense.
B009K72EP8,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,The clone wars is a very good series for all ages.  Season 5 is just as great as the other 4 seasons.  I like the episode about the droids mission.  I recommend this to everyone  good animation and good a good storyline.
B009K72EP8,Mike,5,Great series all the way through I really recommend this series's too anyone whoever likes a lot of action great acting voices and great mystery not to mention excellent animation if you like that you will enjoy this even season 1 through 4 from start to finish.
B009K72EP8,mipiacedeltutto,5,As always happens with the Star Wars: The Clone Wars the first few episodes are slow but then the series really picks up and the later season story arcs are almost impossible to stop watching.
B009K72EP8,Rachel Kessinger,1,Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work. It still won't work on my Sony blu ray player. No idea why. I don't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early. This is not how I saw my bday gift to my husband going. Thanks for making it a lame gift. So upset!
B009K72EP8,w.ri,5,The clone wars is a great series that I really appreciate as it is one of the best star wars animations throughout the series.
B009KH9XX4,BenGray,3,not as good as the original. leaves a little bit lacking. wouldn't recommend it as a must have. just ok
B009KH9XX4,Ellen Ward,4,ending was unclear and unexpected; but the story  kept one interested; the acting was good  especially that of Alderton as Thomas.
B009KH9XX4,Emily H. Leonard "catsmother",5,An unusual pair of antagonists in somewhat contrived situations. The last episode of the final seasons makes one realize how deeply invested the viewer has become.
B009KHBGWK,June,5,I love the characters and how they work so well with each other. It has had me guessing several times about the relationships.
B009KHBGWK,JW-169,5,I think it's as good as third watch was......... And I like the cast. I like tha Batln. Chief. I always enjoy a good TV series about the Fire Dept. And Police Dept..
B009KHBGWK,Linda Saxton,5,This show is very good. Has a lot of fire fighting and is realistic. The actors are realistic also. Very good show.
B009KHBGWK,M. Kennedy,5,A diverse group of characters and all have special qualities.  Hope to see a second season to learn the outcome of so many cliffhangers.
B009KHBGWK,RAM,5,I love watching this show every week and I like to be able to download and watch if I miss it! I love it!
B009KHBGWK,ReviewersEars,5,Traditional take on a tried and true genre.  Guilty pleasure?  Definitely.  What's wrong with watching beautiful firefighters & paramedics take on super tense situations and leave us with fantastic (albeit slightly predictable) cliffhangers?  I really enjoy the show - it's like drinking that first cup of coffee every morning!  Aaaahhhh....
B009KHBGWK,R. M "movier",4,I viewed this show from all the commercials and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is . I am hooked.
B009KHBGWK,smashbox24cr,1,So dark and depressing. Awful because of the rampant promiscuity as well. Your all going to get vd and stds.
B009KHBGWK,wanona thomas,5,I love it because I'm a healthcare junkie. I've been in for the last twenty two years and this reminds me of work. This show is great joy to me thank you.
B009KHHELW,Amazon Customer,5,My family and I enjoy watching {and laughing} Duck Dynasty!! Great morals!
B009KHHELW,Angie,5,Always makes me laugh. Not many comedies on TV can claim that fame for me. Love the lesson sum up at the end.
B009KHHELW,Anubis,5,These guys are hilarious but they keep to their religious views at the end of the day.
B009KHHELW,Cindy,5,So great to have a fun show to watch with kids and grandkids!!  There are so few shows out there worth watching!
B009KHHELW,DENISE NAVARRO,5,I just love this show. Wish I didn't have to pay to see the rest. As his daddy would say HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.
B009KHHELW,Dennis P. Blackwell,5,Entertaining and pure Americana .  Probably the best program on the air .  I hope they continue for a few more years.
B009KHHELW,D. R. Pike "Rob Pike",5,Great Family entertainment. This show is always funny and keeps the humor clean.
B009KHHELW,Holly,5,Love Duck Dynasty. Wholesome show. Totally fun to watch. Appropriate for kids. Makes me want to go outdoors and hike more
B009KHHELW,Jennifer D. Williams,5,Duck Dynasty is a great family fun television show to watch!! It is good ole clean FUN!!!! I absolutely love it!!!
B009KHHELW,Jenn Weiskopff,5,If you have heard the hype about this show but have not watched it yet...just watch it! You will be hooked just like the rest of us!
B009KHHELW,Joan Bachman,5,I love Duck Dynasty especially when they end the day with prayer.  The only show I had to walk away from was when they went frog hunting.  Has Sadie gotten her license to drive yet?  She is a beautiful young woman but keep an eye on her at all times.  Boy out there are preditors.  I love to hear them talk.Keep all the little girls safe.
B009KHHELW,Kerry A. Barndt,5,very funny and interesting.  My husband really enjoys watching the videos and keeps watching as long as there are more of them
B009KHHELW,Kirk,1,poor little millionaires making even more money on the idiots that care about duck dynasty's daily lives!  reality TV is the worst!
B009KHHELW,mbyers,5,Great for the whole family. Hilarious redneck twist on normal everyday life. Absolutely love the moral and prayer at the end of each episode. Should have more shows like this!
B009KHHELW,readinglarge,5,It will make you happy happy happy to watch this gang of good old boys from Louisiana get up to tricks again while attempting to run their business.good watching for the whole family.
B009KHHELW,R.L. Black,5,Great show!  It is fun and has great family values.  We stream these over and over on Amazon Prime. Highly recommend this show.
B009KHHELW,Robert W. Evans,5,i love the show and  they have become so popular and I get a kick out of akll of them
B009KHHELW,Rob Lynn,5,This show sort of grows on you. At first it seems as if it is all about the money but these guys do seem to have a moral compass; though sometimes it's not till supper time that it shows. Recommend for all (even us poor people). LOL.
B009KHHELW,Route66Review,1,Do not believe all the rave reviews.  They're  all from family members and die hard fans who don't want to see these bird killers go.  It's time to close the curtains on this lame show already.
B009KHHELW,R. S. Neilson "Preacher",4,This is a fun show for the whole family. It teaches some good morals and doesn't take anything too seriously. It is contrived and unbelievable at times but it's still good to see a family staying together even when things don't go well.
B009KHHELW,susan,4,another son favorite very intresting he must really love it cause he has gotten 2 seasons try you might like
B009KHHELW,Weebol Johnson "Weebol",5,This show cracks me up.  It's nice to watch a reality show that isn't all about DRAMA.  This show is light hearted and very ridiculous at times.  I like the values that the cast sticks to no matter the situation and how they end every episode together as a family.  Not as much hunting and fishing in this season as the first one but still as good.  Really enjoyed it!  Can't wait for Amazon to put Season 3 on Prime.
B009KHHELW,W. Prentice,5,Love the characters and the way they are developed. Love the rags to riches theme also! Looking forward to watching the whole season!
B009KOE4ZO,Cward55,4,Very well done sequel that adds on to the first one and the mythos of the building. I loved the whole plot about this as some youtube kid reviews the movie and then finds out about some cover up involving the first film as it actually happened and goes to investigate it. I loved the first one and this one I think is just as good so I say you need to check this out if your a fan of horror movies or ghot type movies.
B009KOE4ZO,D. McNamara,4,The effects when they occur are spooky. The story and the acting are only mediocre. Good for a late night scare.
B009KZYXKY,Elizabeth L. Clark,5,Maw Maw and gang sure do make my family laugh.  This excellent shows continues to spread joy and remind us of what is most important - your family.
B009KZYXKY,Kellie V. Bravender "kvbravender",5,We LOVE Raising Hope!!  After the first season...  a real &#34;knee slapper&#34;....  I was wondering how they would continue to come up w/such entertaining story lines...  as in the beginning &#34;Hope&#34; is just an infant....  Somehow they've done it!... We never miss an episode.
B009KZYXKY,Stargazer Trading,5,Better than last season.  I was afraid once Jimmy and Sabrina got together the show would lose its center (like so many shows do when main characters hook up); but instead it just gets better and better.
B009L0H5OY,Al Mellon,5,It is just a fun show to watch.  My wife and I enjoy it for the plots and the comedy.
B009L0H5OY,Amazon Customer "spedteach",5,I really like this show!  The characters are so funny!  This show is definitely worth watching if you are sick of crime shows.
B009L0H5OY,Another opinion,5,I just discovered this show by accident with the season 3 finale on CW.  I loved the show so much I had to get the DVDs for past seasons.  All the actors are entertaining and charming.  It's a great show.
B009L0H5OY,Cyndi W "SipRedWine",5,I love watching Hart of Dixie.  They capture the heart of a small town and the southern belles to a T!  Great characters and writing!
B009L0H5OY,cynthia,5,I really love this series!  It is much better than reading a book!  My husband even likes this show.  It is so typical of small town life with a bit extra added in for good measure.  What a way to end the work day! I could not wait until I could see the next episode!!!
B009L0H5OY,GKJ,3,This is a fun show to watch. The plot does not often stay true to it's course. Nevertheless I do enjoy the show because the characters seem to have fun with the show. I usually enjoy romantic comedies. They have to be really bad to get less than three stars form me.
B009L0H5OY,Greg V,5,Gets you involved in the characters and manages to have fun with with the South without being overly stereotypical or condescending.
B009L0H5OY,J. E. Ramsey "Jeram",4,Zoe Hart is back and is as funny as ever. The hostage scene (not to give anything away) was hilarious.
B009L0H5OY,June,5,It's better every week. Zoe needs someone like Wade....they are funny together & they get one another. Poor George needs to find his own woman & forget about Zoe & Lemon.
B009L0H5OY,M. Kennedy,5,I realize Alabama is a lot further south than Virginia but sometimes the accents are over the top but fun stories and characters.
B009L0H5OY,MM,5,This is just good fun. Silly and addicting. I find that I end up watching 3 or 4 episodes a night and then can't wait for thenext season.
B009L0H5OY,M Parker,4,This has become one of my favorite tv series. The people in this town never seem to really work and there are all these town events that everyone is involved in.  Its funny and a great escape after a hard day at work.  I can hardly wait until next season comes out.
B009L0H5OY,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",5,I didn't think I would like this when I started watching Series 1 but I really did. The characters have a lot of depth to them and really hook you in. The story is light hearted and fun. I'm through season two now.
B009L0H5OY,NormaJean James,5,I love this series because it shows the southern culture the way it should be instead of how it really is.  It would be wonderful if it would be OK to have a black mayor who has relationships with white women and no one cares.  People also seem to really care about each other in this fictional small town with none of the small town gossip or mean-spirited class conflict.
B009L0H5OY,pj ellen,5,We do not have cable and I usually watch this program the next day on line.  Downloaded it to my Kindle Fire because I missed it.
B009L0H5OY,Suzi,4,The show is awesome!  I like how the stories are told and the characters are interesting and you get invested in Blue Belle!  The quality of the streaming is sometimes spotty but that could be due to internet connection.
B009L46WWQ,Cathy P.,5,ok i really like all surveying type shows and watching people living off the grid and this family is really doing that. This is excellent and i find it vastly entertaining.
B009L46WWQ,goodynuf,5,Getting a glimpse of the Kilcher (sp?) family life and hardships is not only interesting but informative.  They must self-sustain for all aspects of their life for basic needs like food and water to heat.  The scenery is spectacular.  The hunting and fishing is not for sport but for sustenance.  I enjoy learning about different lifestyles and this show gives a very honest view of that.
B009L46WWQ,Larry,5,living off the grid (supposedly)  you can see evidence of electrical service  but living in Alaska would be tough even with electricityshows some of the perils and hardships involved. A little too much informantion on the subject of POO
B009L46WWQ,Rock N Rob,5,This show is a great way to see how the settlers lived with just a little technology to help them live a little better. Wish I was up there with them. So glad there are women that enjoy that way of life. Rock on.
B009L99U34,Jessica Fritz,5,This show is really well done. Very interesting and he's a great guy. I love his approach and narration. Recommend.
B009L99U34,Mr. Phil,5,A very succinct way of cutting to the chase.  Its apparent as to why this guy was so successful at solving homicides.  We all are spouting &#34;kendaisms&#34; around the house.
B009L99U34,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",3,This is a pretty good crime show.  Detective Kenda kind of reminds me of Horatio in CSI Miami with his &#34;cool&#34; one liners but overall its enjoyable and well done.
B009LG31R8,HillBuzz dot ORG "HillBuzz dot ORG",1,This movie is really bad.  Not funny in the least.  A total waste of time. So sorry I rented it.
B009M73DN8,Carolyn Stewart "Can't get enough arty stuff",2,I had expected more for the main character. So good in Friday Night Lights! This is weakly written and lacks polish.
B009M73DN8,DonnaSays "Amazon makes my Life easy!",5,love this show had missed a few episodes of the first season so we bought season one and glad we did.
B009M73DN8,J. Gwin "Jules",5,A must have. Every episode gets better and better. I will watch over and over. That's how much I love this series. You will too.
B009M73DN8,Laura,5,Love this show. When I am unable to watch it is set for DVR. I like all the songs that they sing on the show and I play the CD's in my car all the time. Would recommend to anybody.
B009M73DN8,Lynn,5,I chose this rating because the pilot was awesome! I'm just barely on episode 5 but it's keeping my attention.
B009M73DN8,RAM,5,Every episode of Nashville is better than the last! It's worth watching the whole season. Season 1 was a great start....looking forward to season 2!
B009M73DN8,Rich,5,Best musical drama show I've watched in a long time. y the CD and listen to the music. The story is Great also. Hope Deacon get's a break soon he deserves one. ABC is know for cancelling good shows!!! So buy the DVD now before they decide to cancel the show and put the DVD out of print. It's happened before trust me. They prefer Revenge over Nashville. I men come on if you can't kill your enemies in four years that's pretty sad. Nashville has a hell of a lot more potential for a great long series than Revenge which they renewed and cancelled Nashville for season 3. so enjoy the music and story it' great.
B009M73DN8,scent chick,5,Very happy with this show!  Great story line - I'm def hooked!  Connie Britton does an excellent job!  Will be anxious for season 2!
B009MQVO0S,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",5,I can't say that I am any good at writing reviews or anything of that matter but I really liked this movie.  Call me a nerd or a loser..whatever the name of the day is...I could actually relate to this young man and how he felt out of place...not now perhaps but there was a time.  A great story and a moral if you are really paying attention.
B009MQVO0S,Lyna,4,It's kind of a weighty and deep-seated film about a young man or boy(?) trying to find his way in life.  Not for the carefree and light-hearted.
B009MQVO0S,Ray Macmeeken "Ray MacMeeken",3,The movie had a great cast and many independent movies do but this was kind of hard to follow.  You just kept wait for the plot to take you somewhere and it really never came.  I gave three stars because of the cast but the plot I would give one.
B009MUWEJE,MsMouse "MsMouse",3,based on a true story this was a good movie.  It was a bit drawn out for my taste but still okay
B009MUWEJE,Robert J. Maceri "mongoose41",3,We enjoyed watching this movie.  It was different and interesting.  We are happy that the kidnapper got her just rewards.
B009MUWEJE,Taheen Lopez,3,The Lifetime original movie Abducted: The Carlina White Story is based on a remarkable true story that made headlines twice. Carlina White knows something is very wrong when she can't develop a deep bond with her mother.
B009N452XY,Karen L. Hilliard,1,This movie was soooooo awful and the pitiful attempt to be blair witch was sickening. Maybe come up with something original.
B009NB5UXE,Mootsie,5,I enjoy watching this type of material.  A Haunting primarily leans towards bad or demon type entities.  Maybe to make it more ominous or scary for the viewer.  Definitely would be fun to watch around Halloween.
B009NPK1IO,Miss Berly,3,I binge watched the first five seasons while I was recovering from knee surgery. It was great and I really enjoyed it. Now I feel like I'm slogging through until the finale.
B009O6QKKK,Amazon Customer,5,I'm a big fan of whodunit dramas and lately have been watching an array of British shows that have been excellent.  Whitechapel is one of those.  Interesting and intriguing stories filled with unique and interesting characters.  Season two's murder room added a female detective who's got an unusual mother hen kind of vibe.  And the lead detective DI Chandler has taken a page from Mr Monk.
B009O6QKKK,Amazon Customer,4,The Brits make the best &#34;who done it&#34; detective shows and this one is very good. The sergeant's character is particularly rich.
B009O6QKKK,Bob,4,The characters are unique and their relationship s add greatly to the plot. I THOROUGHLY ENJOY. I wish there were more episodes.
B009O6QKKK,Book Lover,4,Good chemistry in the crew of this series. Season 2 didn't have quite the tension of Season 1 and the idea of connecting the modern crimes with the old gangsters was not quite as dramatic as Jack the Ripper from Season 1. Although those twins sure were a 10 on the creepy chart!
B009O6QKKK,cat lady 4 "Bumber's Mom",5,I find this series great fun and good suspense.  I like the way the relationship between the team members has developed since season 1
B009O6QKKK,Colleen,4,The cast and characters are great together!  It is nicely done!Better than most tv series on regular television and cable!
B009O6QKKK,Dan,4,Good British TV but a  little gory at times.  We'll worth watching and free.
B009O6QKKK,DeDe "DeDe",4,Who doesn't like Rupert Penry-Jones....  episodes move a little slow- but still worth watching and still better than most of what we get on our Prime Time channels..
B009O6QKKK,Fred,5,Outstanding detective and police series one of Masterpiece's best up to date stories. Sorry to see there is only one Season left.
B009O6QKKK,grace,5,Great drama. Excellent acting. Strong story lines. Excellent ensemble group. Wish there was another season. Watched on prime so great bargain
B009O6QKKK,grand,4,Good acting and interesting stories. Closed captioning helps to understand the various British accents. Scenery from foreign countries makes it interesting.
B009O6QKKK,jean h.,3,Interesting crimes and more development of characters. Still has lots of unusual crimes with twists and turns as the stories develope.
B009O6QKKK,J. N. McCarthy,4,If you llike crime thrillers this will keep you captivated.  The English perspective is quite good and the characters definitely play well with each other.  Enjoyed Season 1 which peaked my interest with season 2.  If you enjoy &#34; who done its&#34; you won't be disappointed with Whitechapel.
B009O6QKKK,John M. Delisle,5,I thought this was one of the best shows I have seen in a while.  The cases were very interesting.
B009O6QKKK,Julzweaver "Julzweaver",4,What a treat to watch a totally flawed fictional character bring such &#34;every day&#34; realism to a part. I almost forgot that Perry-Jones wasn't the one with the OCD.
B009O6QKKK,Katherine B. Brewton,4,Good Show.  Good Actors.  I would like to see more episodes.  Different take on the usual Scotland Yard detective show.
B009O6QKKK,lilacsblooming,5,I loved the angle of where history meets crime and being able to learn from previous cases to solve what is currently happening!
B009O6QKKK,M1Hop2,5,Rupert Penry-Jones is an old friend from MI5. He has credibility as both characters and that's no easy feat since the characters are completely different from one another.
B009O6QKKK,Michelle Polk,4,The show is worth watching. The acting is well done. The story line is good and interesting. I wouldn't recommend it as a family show since some of the content isn't suitable for young audiences.
B009O6QKKK,MtnMysteryReader,5,this series is among the very best of British mystery thrillers.  Joe Chandler seems to be in over his head sometimes but Ray Miles as his Sargent is an able leveler.  I hope there will be more than the three seasons to enjoy.
B009O6QKKK,NM Shadow "NM Shadow",5,The first season characters are back with a few additions. The back stores of each character continue to come out with some surprises. As before the stories are tight and it is a challenge to watch a single episode and not continue immediately to the next.
B009O6QKKK,P. Alexander "savyshopper",4,I would give this 5 stars but it is a little too bloody and tends to end the episode with a stunner that doesn't make you want to go to bed. I like it best when I can move onto the next episode and not just before bed. I love it but it is a bit disturbing. I will watch all the episodes. My rating is for the series not an individual episode.
B009O6QKKK,Patricia Maierson,5,Excellent writing and acting...well done British crime drama that was consistently entertaining and held our attention though out the series.
B009O6QKKK,Peggy H. Rose,5,Enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel and was not let down by this second season.  Am looking forward to Season 3.
B009O6QKKK,Robert C. Wieland "MUSIC LOVER",5,One of the best series I have seen so far. The lead character is so twitchy and so out there you sometimes feel the same pain he's going through and are thankful that he has someone to help him through the adjustments he has to make while solving crimes and trying to live his life outside of the office.
B009O6QKKK,Scott C Piercey,1,Boring and dry. characters did not entice me to continue to watch this program. I find that British shows can be really good or boring.
B009O6QKKK,Sharon,4,I really like this series and look forward to viewing the rest of it. Its interesting and well acted. Designed for adult viewing.
B009O6QKKK,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",5,Well done. Well written. I got addicted and watched the whole series in about two weeks. I highly recommend it.
B009O6QKKK,Wellred_2 "Carol",4,I really like the series but I find the outcome very predictable. I know half way through it 'who done it'!
B009OYSFDM,Aaron Sewell,5,Very fun show with a good cast. Can't wait to buy season 2 and can't wait until season 3 comes out on tv.
B009OYSFDM,Amazon Customer "LABMONKEY",4,Not fantastic but a descent hero fix. Gets better as the season progresses. I could do with less family drama and more arrows...
B009OYSFDM,Annamarie Lubow "Anna",5,So far we are enjoying this.  It's got just enough mystery and backstory to be interested and the storylines are not totally lame.  The fact that John Barrowman is in it is enough to keep me going.
B009OYSFDM,Annette Delaney,5,I had no idea what this show was about but after watching the first episode I purchased the entire season.  I'm only sorry that season 2 has not come out yet!
B009OYSFDM,Antonio,4,Awesome show.  Hope they continue to follow the comic book.  Would like to see a team up with another super hero down the road.
B009OYSFDM,Ariel Miller,5,It's like Robin Hood and Batman rolled into one.  Of course there is the eye candy for the ladies but enough mystery and action that men will enjoy as well.  A favorite in our house.
B009OYSFDM,BenGray,4,started out better than the finish but it was fun and entertaining. liked the strong female influencing characters. i would get another season
B009OYSFDM,Brandonia,5,I watched the entire season when it was on TV and was hooked in from minute 1. It's a great show and I pre-ordered it as soon as it ended even though I knew it wouldn't arrive for months.
B009OYSFDM,btjones1983,5,If they don't make a second season I will be shocked. I absolutely loved this show! Watched it on Amazon while deployed and it made my day every time I got to see it.
B009OYSFDM,C. Hughes,3,I'm loving the show 'cause I tend to like superhero features and Amell is a nice looking superhero. I think his acting style is kind of wooden but I'm still trying to figure out if it's his acting or if his acting choice as a way to represent a PTSD individual who has been on an island for 5 years and who was tortured at some point during that time.
B009OYSFDM,claiib,5,This is a series that has amazing writers and makes me look forward to purchasing the next episode on my kindle fire. The cast and crew have done a brilliant job as well.
B009OYSFDM,Coolaid,5,So we missed an episode on our DVR.. The streaming was just like we where watching it live well worth it.
B009OYSFDM,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,This is my favorite series but I think it is still one or two episodes to go.  The actor that plays Oliver Queen is very good.  I did not read the comic but I saw the green arrow or emeral arrow on Smallville.  I hope this series get a great review.
B009OYSFDM,Dave101,5,This program was a complete surprise to me. It was an survival adventure. It was Batman. It was the Green Hornet. It was beautifully photographed and professionally acted and directed. I can't wait until next season is released.
B009OYSFDM,Dave C. Omeara,5,I really like this series.  the island myseteries and the cast are great.I recommend it highly.Definitely worth it!
B009OYSFDM,Donald G. Siering,5,love it..its really great so far and how sexy is arrow? i think most would enjoy this show for sure
B009OYSFDM,Ebbo,5,I never thought that a TV series would be made that would have such a believable character... the actors in this new show were well picked.
B009OYSFDM,Elisha C. Douglas,5,I really like this show. I hope that the character grows more as a person as the series continues.  Being the underdog will get tiresome after awhile.
B009OYSFDM,Frankie D,5,This series blowws Smallville out the water. A very good series that has a good backstory with flashbacks. Action is off the hook. Never a big fan of Green Arrow but this is how you do a superhero series.  The transformation of Oliver Queen rich playboy into the vilgilante called the Hood.  Smallville went on too long and Heroes dropped the ball  and jumped the shark. This show has good pacing to start. If you like superhero shows and read the Green Arrow comics you will like this
B009OYSFDM,jay,5,Thougt it would be a another series that tried to use green arrow and not succeed .But I was surprised at how good it actually turned out.
B009OYSFDM,JAY L. KOLKMAN,4,I was very surprised at how well I liked this show.  They have very magnetic characters that are easy to get attached to.
B009OYSFDM,Jim,5,This is a must watch tv show of all time. If you like action then you will love this tv show. Just watch the first episode and you will know how awesome is this tv show.
B009OYSFDM,Judith Tyler,4,I chose to give this 4 stars because I like the originality of this show. I also like the intricate relationships. Best new show this year.
B009OYSFDM,Kathryn M Guffey,5,This show is a little different from most  of your shows. Perhaps that is what is the attraction for it. I enjoy it very much.
B009OYSFDM,Kevin W. Moyer,5,This has been a sure delight for me.  I began very dubious as to it's ability to pull of a believable character & plot from episode to episode.  They're doing it..  I'm loving it!!
B009OYSFDM,K. Thomas,5,Great Show. Love the characters and the story line. Wish the episodes were longer. Cannot wait for the next episode.
B009OYSFDM,L.J. Brown,5,It is a wonderful season it helped me get into the 2nd season that just started.  Once I saw the 1st show on season 2 I knew I had to buy the 1st to catch up. LJBrown
B009OYSFDM,lremick,5,I loved  season one and the packaging was great! I only purchase series seen and liked. If any one asks for  my imput I would recommend this series. Looking forward to season two.
B009OYSFDM,Matein Movies,4,DC they have taken your superhero out of content. They have turned him into a soap opera but I like it. It is different espcially all the flasbacks of Green Arrow's origin. Oliver Queen where have you gone a world opens its arms to you. Bullseye.
B009OYSFDM,Michael A. Jolley,5,I think the show has alot of potential.  The first episodes  caught my attention quickly.  Hoping the rest of them are just as good.  Like shows made from comic books.
B009OYSFDM,Michael B.,4,Unlike the Green Arrow in "Smallville" this one will kill the bad guys. I never liked the comic book Green Arrow but this one I do enjoy watching as long as they don't start watering it down.
B009OYSFDM,Niki,5,Once again I found a outstanding show. Once again I bought the episodes until I caught up with it on TV. The show you never know what is going to happen next. I love watching them arrows and what he does with them. He came along way from being lost but he is doing what needs to be done. I hope they don't cancel this show like they always do with the good stuff. You got to watch it too see what I am talking about. I believe it was worth every dime to catch up with it on TV.
B009OYSFDM,Ray L. Babcock "Brooks on Golf",5,Reminds me of a spin off of Batman or something but has two great story lines - one of his maturation and change on the mystery island and then of his activities when he returns home.  I watch these episodes several times - they are great fun.
B009OYSFDM,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,Another show where good is pitted against evil.  In this case the big corporation heads who have only personal agendas with no compassion for their underlings.  Main character well cast and sexy to a fault without being super good looking.  Different from anything else on the tube.  Highly recommended.
B009OYSFDM,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),5,Being a longtime of fan of comic book super heroes and greatly enjoyed the series Smallville I knew that after watching a few episodes of this series it was a must have.  The series seems to try and keep the darker undertone aspects that we saw with the Dark Knight movie trilogy while not too dark as to push away younger audiences.  It's nice to see the background story of Oliver as he turns from rich apathetic and over indulgent playboy to a serious and honorable man looking to correct the mistakes he and his family have done.  The series also introduces a few iconic DC characters into the show as well of course a few love interest for our young hero.If you already have the Smallville series this is a great addition to add to your library and hopefully we'll see a pretty long run for the series.  Just waiting for the new Constantine and Flash series to come out later this year too.
B009OYSFDM,Rich Mahogany,4,Show is great although there are a few notable weak episodes particularly with Vertigo and some cheesy lines throughout. The action is awesome and Arnell is awesome as Oliver with the flashbacks to the island being the highlight in my opinion.
B009OYSFDM,serenity83,4,I like the content of the series and the story line.  I think the action it adequate and not extremely violent.  I find that netflix delivers the content in better quality with no pauses and interruptions though.  I would wish that were corrected.  Overall  I like the series and would recommend it.
B009OYSFDM,Seven,5,This is a great series. It doesnt have the camp like Smallville. But a serious look at a serious hero. You see his flaws and his strengths. Each choice doesnt always take him in the direction he wants or needs. Just adds to the story as it grows. Just awesome!!
B009OYSFDM,S. Warren,4,This one is what i expected of green arrow.  Though so far im hoping for more change and developement in the character.  I liked smallville how the character developed.  Though so far its doesnt have too much development toward the character.  So I gave it a 4 star.  Hoping the character developes a bit more as the story goes otherwise the story goes stagnet.  Where its a numerous stories but no change to the character starts to bore me.
B009OYSFDM,T. Lansburg "elecbanker",5,Good storyline which keeps evolving.  It will be interesting to see where the storyline will go now that his identity is known to others.
B009PI7EIE,B.C.,5,One of my favorite comedies of all time. I would highly recommend. Every season gets better and better. Hopefully there is a 5th season.
B009PI7EIE,Brian,5,More of the funny sociopathic comedy that is The League. Rafi gets better every single season. Definitely worth a watch.
B009PI7EIE,Daniel Lalor,5,One of the funniest shows ever. I watch it over and over.. .the characters are real and the comedy so low brow it is fantastic.
B009PI7EIE,Dave C. Omeara,5,I think I just watched all of the episodes in 1 week.  Unique characters and very funny story line.  great show!!!
B009PI7EIE,Randy S. Milliron "Randune23",5,It is a great season and to watch the characters evolve over the years has been fun.  Amazon Prime makes it easy to catch-up on shows that you may have missed for whatever reason.Randy
B009PI7EIE,Serenity,5,Very funny and nice to watch with your own Fantasy Football Fan.  This season does not disappoint.  The character's are funny with great guest stars.
B009PI7JMU,Amazon Customer,5,Love the show! Seven  episodes I thought were kinda slow.8th episode was the turning point.A lot of things happened after that.We the fans are hoping for a second season.Hope this will come out on DVD coz I will buy it.
B009PI7JMU,anastasia,5,A whole new spin on crime shows. Entertaining for teenagers and adults! This show is like Supernatural meets Criminal Minds.
B009PI7JMU,Chelley,5,I avoided watching this for a while.  I finally decided to watch and once I started I quickly feel in love with this series
B009PI7JMU,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",4,The season starts off pretty good but gets bogged down in several places.  The &#34;evil bad guys&#34; are more distracting and overly powerful it seems.  The love story does not really get going until almost 15+ episodes into the season.  I hope it makes the cut and next season we can see a group of people besides just Vincent taking on Mearfield &#60;sp&#62;
B009PI7JMU,JJ,5,This remake is a lot more believe able than the first one!  The characters are great!  Each actor does a really good job!  Vincent is very believe able in this show!  The feds are also believe able as being a secret government agency hiding something.  I recommend this for people 13 and older!
B009PI7JMU,K. Thomas,5,Great Twist. Cat is awesome as well as Vincent. Cannot wait until the next episode. Wish they were longer. Good action.
B009PI7JMU,Paula,4,I like my show. I hope it keeps playing. I watched the original one and thins one is almost as good.
B009PI7JMU,Scott Newton,5,I missed an episode in this series and was able to watch it through Amazon.  Note: There is a small fee for this...but it was worth it to me!Also: It had Closed Caption -- a Huge Plus for me!!
B009PI7JMU,SHERRI,5,Where did Jay Ryan(the beast) come from! He is a great actor and he is not bad to look at either. I like the interactions of the characters and the changing plot. All the characters are attractive. Catherine is of course beautiful. I like her interactions with Vincent(Ryan) and with her partner.
B009PI7JMU,T. Brady "Tom",5,This is the perfect title for this show.  I would call this along the line of the incredible hulk with an extra beauty as an addition. The way the guy is made up when he gets upset looks pretty damn good for being a "beast".  I have not missed an episode since it started.  The girl plays a beautiful cop with a bit of "beast" in her sort of like Chuck Norris. The friendship develops very strong and is a perfect addition to make the entire show.
B009PI7JMU,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,2,Kristen continues to find acting that portrays her in the &#34;same old - same old&#34; fashion.  Why did she pick the same old type of roll as she played in Smallville.
B009PK3BZ2,Brett T Moore,5,Always Sunny never fails to make me laugh.  The other day I was watching it and I choked on my brocolli because I was laughing while eating.  I am ok.
B009PK3BZ2,Gerrob,3,Its not the same any more. I don't know what's wrong but I hope they fix it. This was better than last week.
B009PK3BZ2,Grace11,5,Great!  It's always funny to watch &#34;It's Always Sunny ...&#34;  Great  season to watch--this show will never let you down!
B009PK3BZ2,Jeffrey T. Kane,5,I can't give away anything about this episode without ruining it.  It was brilliant from beginning to end and the twist just blew me away.All the characters had great moments but Charlie especially owned this episode.Reminds of of why I got so into this show in the first place.  It's amazing to think they can maintain this level of quality after so many seasons.Just brilliant writing all around.Dennis was awesome too.
B009PK3BZ2,jess,5,this show keeps getting better by the season. when they posted it on netflix i sat down and watched 1-7 in a week . loved it so much i couldnt wait for them to get 8 so i got it on here
B009PK3BZ2,Michael,5,I saw ads for this show for years but never watched it. Last month I was desperate for a good comedy to watch and tried the first episode. And was hooked. And now I am almost finished with the eighth season wondering how I am going to last until fall when the new season appears.Season 8 is one of my favorites. The show has aged well. Still very inventive and because it is on FX is has a definite edge to it.
B009PK3BZ2,Ricardo Serrano "Photogeek",5,This show does not relent.  Funniest show on TV.  Once you get to know the characters. I hope this show goes on forever.
B009PK3BZ2,Scriptor "jigsaw1999",5,The production value's been upped in Season 8.  The access to what appears to be 'mainstream Hollywood' hasn't hurt the series humor - which is remains as politically incorrect as ever.  Probably the funniest thing on the air today!  The characters are brilliant - hope they keep up the great work for years to come!
B009PK3BZ2,Serenity,5,You should watch the first seven seasons of this show to fully understand these characters & their dynamics to be able to fully grasp the humor of this show.
B009PNW4LG,DS "Say something about yourself!",5,very well done and all middle schoolers should watch them and be inspired to go to college and become scientists
B009PNW4LG,Gary W. Luster,5,very good educational TV viewing. ;I like these kind of shows and this one is on my sist of science shows to watch.
B009PNW4LG,S. Donohoe,5,Ok not just my son!  I love too!  It is very interesting. I really enjoy the subjects covered.  It also doesn't put you to sleep.
B009QW6A0M,Cheryl,5,This is the most informative and funny collection of pet videos. The videos introduces the audience to many different breeds of puppies and kittens. You will learn what it takes to care for each breed. The best part with all the cuteness and fun you will learn while being entertained.
B009QW6A0M,C. Sawyer,5,The warning at the beginning is for real.  This is the cutest series ever.  There just isn't anything cuter than puppies and kittens.
B009QW6A0M,CT Crawford,3,Great education for understanding the various breeds of dogs but would like to see comparisons of other dogs in each breed.
B009QW6A0M,ilikebooks,5,We love this show--cute and educational!  My kids like learning about how cats care for their newborn kittens.  And the breeds they chose are adorable.
B009QW6A0M,Lurch,5,This is a winner who ever came up with catching cute on film deserves an award.  Keep it up and keep them coming.  This will touch your heart even if yours is cold each episode has fun and sweet all through it
B009QW6A0M,magicboo2u,3,Watched one episode and it was about cats-informational. Didnt watch a second one because as usual Amazon keeps stopping during playback-even on my computer!
B009QW6A0M,Marilyn M. Green,4,This is the greatest series to watch if you are feeling down because there is no way you can watch these cute animals and stay blue.The animals are showcased in the cutest antics. The editing is great and shows the animals doing the cutest things. You  just have to watch to enjoy the funny things the animals do. The narration enhances the shows by providing a story line with each of the three sets of animals being featured.I would recommend this series to anyone young and old.
B009QW6A0M,norma jean kringer,5,I can hardly handle the cuteness of this program.  My grandchildren love this show so much that we talk and talk about it and re-watch it and never gets dull even after 10 times watching
B009QW6A0M,TomG "CW Junkie",5,She even likes the puppies but really likes kitten shows as much as I do. This is just the type of show that people need to get away from the constant bombardment of bad news every day. At least you feel good after watching.
B009RLX2G2,Adrianne M. Callahan "3kmom",4,The parents had a lot of issues in these episodes and it took away from the kids but still a good show with great dancing
B009RLX2G2,bcre8tiv,1,I watched the whole season and wished I hadn't. The mom drama is disgusting and judges are idiotic. Robin Antin comparing everything to her Pussycat Dolls franchise was laughable. She mentioned it in almost every critique of a dancer when the kids on the show were already more talented than that group that no one has heard of anymore.
B009RLX2G2,Cathy Dunican,5,I have watched Dance Moms from the beginning.  Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition is a fun show from the sassy Abby Lee Miller. This show has Asia in it and shows how she and Abby first found each other.  Also Hadley and Zack who ended up with Candy Apples  This is a great show and fun to watch
B009RLX2G2,Chad,4,For a first season of a show this was pretty enjoyable. In many ways we liked it better than Dance Mom's. We also felt that the winner should have actually won which demonstrates that after all the theatrics of trying to make it feel like a competition it was actually about who could dance better in the end. Worth a watch if you want to just vegetate and not think to much.
B009RLX2G2,Julie "juliedolls",4,This is actually a good opportunity to see some very talented young dancers show their stuff. The show misses 5 star rating for me because I don't think the people who judge the dancers along with Abby are equal to her. The comments they make to the dancers don't seem to have a lot to do with the quality of the performances.
B009RLX2G2,Mary paushel,5,I loved season 1 of this show.  Not really pleased with season 2 but I will probably get it also.  I love being able to buy and watch my favorite shows when I want to.  Excellent sound and quality.
B009RLX2G2,naty0975,5,I love this show it's entertaining and the dancers are great.  The moms are crazy talking about other moms kids it's really facinating to see how people really are when money and fame are on the line.
B009RURGHO,B. Edmondson,5,Really loved the history on these men and weaved into a fun to watch show as well.  Great way to make history fun and interesting to watch.
B009RURGHO,Brenda D. Nelson,5,I&#8217;ve heard about these guys all my life but never really knew their stories!  Great information and it&#8217;s done so well!  It&#8217;s like watching a made for TV mini series!
B009RURGHO,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,I gave this series 5 stars because of the actors the way the story was told.  It was very informative and I just had to watch it all the way through.  I knew these was powerful men but I did not realize how powerful they were until this series.  They did have a major role but it cost them.  I like history and I really like to know about the United States I am living in and how some important men changed all of that.  I could not find anything I dislike about the series.
B009RURGHO,Cyberwiz "Cyberwiz",5,I found this series to be well presented with an informative history of the times. It held my interest to the end.
B009RURGHO,David Fouse,5,I highly recommend this series. A lot of what took place back then (almost 150 years ago) is taking place today. The top 1%. The have's versus the have not's. The huge inequality gap in pay. Topics we read and hear about today. It is very well done and educational.
B009RURGHO,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Great series.  Very informative.  Highly recommend watching &#34;The Men Who Built America&#34;.  We enjoyed watching it.  Well researched and education.
B009RURGHO,Gwen M McDole,5,I love watching these episodes. It is a reflection of the history of America. I'm half way through Season 1 and I can't get enough of it.
B009RURGHO,Jeff's Advice,5,Very well done historical presentation that helps you realize just how capitalism came to be such a force in this country and eventually the world.  The way they have shown the overlap of the most powerful men that built the USA is nothing more than fantastic.  I haven't finished it but I'm really enjoying the episodes that I do watch when I have time.
B009RURGHO,Jorge Gomez,4,Well done historical story. Shows how the titans of American business had crossing paths in ways that I was unaware. Also shows that it takes ruthlessness and a egocentric personality to reach what is considered in the United States the &#34;American Dream&#34; of riches and self-determination.
B009RURGHO,Jose Suerte "Jose Suerte",4,It is a series of simplified summary stories about some very powerful business people. It is well produced and easy to watch. Good if you want to know a little about these titans of industry. Also they have comments by current business people about what they see as some of the key lesson they take from these stories.
B009RURGHO,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",5,We learn about the &#34;robber barons&#34; in school but this production tells us considerably more about the individuals.  I was interested to find out more about their personalities and their interactions with one another.  Their ruthlessness is soft-pedaled a bit as is the norm but happily there was less emphasis on their personal wealth and grand residences and more on their effect on the growing US economy and nation.  They got their starts in a pre-regulation era between the formation of the nation and the full-blow industrial revolution.  Eventually regulation caught up and the era of the unions began.
B009RURGHO,Nance,4,Very entertaining and informative.  Makes you understand how things in America came to be and it makes you realize we really haven't changed that much over the years.  Still just a few rich folks pulling our strings.
B009RURGHO,Olethes A. Hodges,5,We need more series like this one...I loved the educational views and the depiction of life from the moguls were transformed this country in the beginning of our industrial age. As a history buff I enjoyed watching the masterpiece timeline...I want to see more!
B009RURGHO,Phil Levin,5,Very entertaining and interesting.  A much deeper view of these amazing people than anything I have seen before.  Well worth the watch.
B009RURGHO,Roberta,5,They should show these videos in schools.  They are lessons in success and failure and how to over come failure and achieve your goals in spite of adversary.
B009SHO0DY,BrownCoat 96760 "browncoat96760",5,Such a cute show! So very sad to see it go and I hope I'm wrong and that it comes back next mid season. I love the entire cast. I started watching it for Justin Hartley and fell in love with EVERYONE. This leaves and stupid Cult comes? Redic. Bring back Emily Owen please. And please bring a image please for our Kindle library. It looks so stupid!!!!
B009SJ3GUK,Amazon Customer,5,It is just amazing. The characters are all very dynamic. The multiple story lines are something that really brings life to all the characters.
B009SJ3GUK,AnnaC "AnnaC",3,The show throws everything scary  it can at you -except clowns and ventriloquist dummies. Honestly- alien abduction/serial killer with mommy issues/ evil nazi doing human experiments/ zombie like creatures/ crazy people/ nuns/ killer in santa costume /demonic possession.  Seriously- what saved it from being a ridiculous mess was the cast.
B009SJ3GUK,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,I actually started this series by season 3 on tv i have read a lot of reviews and decided to watch the first season and loved it and this one is absolutely insane.
B009SJ3GUK,Cappnormal,5,WOW!Can they fit anymore into a horror show? I don't think so.If you like horror watch this show! I highly recommend it!!!
B009SJ3GUK,CatLoraine,1,I got lost somewhere. Did not understand the connection between beginning and ending. I do not want to watch any more episodes.
B009SJ3GUK,cozzetta,5,Pretty good
B009SJ3GUK,CristiAk "Reading is powerful",5,I love this series. I was expecting it to pick up from season 1 like all series do. I was surprised with a different horror story. I LOVE that! Season 2 was just as awesome as season 1. The episodes are well written and twisted. You never know what is going to happen. The acting is superb. I love Jessica Lange. Her acting has always been of the highest caliber. I am enjoying her in this series and hope she will be in future seasons. The setting in the asylum was creepy. I haven't always liked the flashing between times in a movie/tv show but it worked flawlessly here. Excellent viewing! I recommend this series.
B009SJ3GUK,Darlene,5,I was waiting for this to come out and didn't realize it was available.  I purchased the first season of American Horror Story and this one and now I am awaiting the 3rd season!  Awesome!
B009SJ3GUK,David Keith "Mr. Keith",2,Big let down from season one. This year's show is much too over the top with the writers throwing in every horror cliche and then even more cliches. Back to the drawing board for season 3.
B009SJ3GUK,Devan Shane,5,Finally some horror with an attitude. Not your typical horror with 5 teenagers and a serial murder. The story is very complex with twists and turns. And Jessica Lange is beyond amazing. Can't wait to see what season three has in store.
B009SJ3GUK,Differently Driven "Anime Lover",3,Charging 1.99 per episode for this twisted tale is just one thing I didn't like about his show. It didn't hold my attention like the original did and the story line got lost in between the head mother and twisted doctor vying for the spot of who's more devious than the other. I thought it would be more interesting but it really wasn't. I might watch one more episode just to see if they fix their misguided horror and make it into something more palatable for horror watchers than just gore.
B009SJ3GUK,Donald G. Siering,5,Got hooked on the first season and the second season was even more twisted;;;loved it!...can't wait until season 3!....see if they can outdo themselves
B009SJ3GUK,Eric Hoover,5,This stuff is weird and seems like they write it as they go with no real plan in mind.  It is fun to watch however.
B009SJ3GUK,Golly,2,This season was too dark and violent for me. I made it to episode 4 and thought why am I watching this. Seems like they just want to shock you into how depraved they can make the show. I will pass on the rest of the season.
B009SJ3GUK,Gwen M McDole,5,One of my favorite shows!! I love watching it. Season one is my favorite. Season two is just as a good to watch.
B009SJ3GUK,Jimmy Don Johnson,5,I enjoyed the first series so there was no way I could miss the second.  I was not disappointed.  I have watched this over and over with friends and they all agree it is a scream!
B009SJ3GUK,Jraptor,4,Thats just wrong!" You know the difference between that Santa and me? He only comes once a year!' lear's the psycho. Seeing Al Swearinton (sp) in this episode made my day. I knew it was gonna be rough when he showed up.
B009SJ3GUK,Justin H "Justin",5,Jessica Lange is amazing. The rest of the cast is fantastic. This is a must watch series. It doesn't go anywhere near where you think it will.
B009SJ3GUK,Kathryn L Khanzadeh,5,I liked this season better than the last one and I enjoyed season one immensely.  Jessica Lange is amazing.  I look forward the Season three.
B009SJ3GUK,Kindle Customer,5,I have to say that it was harder to get into than season one BUT this is a great show with a great cast and I can not wait for season 3!!
B009SJ3GUK,Kisa,2,Don:t get it. _enjoyed the first season. This one doesn:t capture my interest from the first episode. Kinda of wondered what happened to the first family. _thought they would continue it.
B009SJ3GUK,kmoore,5,Love this season love that they brought back my favorite characters from last season amazing show. Love it a lot
B009SJ3GUK,Lee DeBree,5,I can't stop watching it. The acting is fantastic. The story is riveting. I can't say enough good things about this show. Just watch it for yourself. Jessica Lange deserves special mention for her portrayal of sister Jude. Haven't seen her since the 1960's King Kong. Where has she been? What a great actress.
B009SJ3GUK,Lyle,5,Who is in charge of the zoo ? Watch to find out. 1 of the few show available for free with Amazon 90.00 a year Prime membership.Be prepared to pay a hugh price for season three available for free with other pay services.
B009SJ3GUK,melvin watkins,4,fisrt my son and daughter started watching this and talking aboutit then i took a peek now just call me tom
B009SJ3GUK,MickeyT "MickeyT",5,This is season two of the most intellectual horror story on TV. A departure from season one in that now the scene is in a insane asylum run by devilish nuns. Very cool story.
B009SJ3GUK,Mike Hunt,5,This show is genuinely scary with a excellent plot and great actor's. Very well written and thought provoking. Every episode slaps you in the face with a viewpoint you have never considered.
B009SJ3GUK,nurse_judith,5,This is a very exciting and turn of event series.  It never sleeps...packed with surprises.  It really draws you in and doesn't let you go.  Definately makes you come back for more.  The actors were incredible with each one perfect for their part.  I would say for sure that this series is for the adult who is not afraid of a little blood and guts.
B009SJ3GUK,readinglarge,1,I enjoyed the first season of this show but this one about a Catholic run asylum I just couldn't stomach enough to even get past the third show.if next season is anything like this one count out this viewer.
B009SJ3GUK,Ricardo Serrano "Photogeek",3,Cool but the first season was better.  Its dark.. Creepy.. And the characters develop well.  But I liked the ghosts.  The asylum is more twisted but less interesting.
B009SJ3GUK,R. M "movier",3,I watched the first season and thought it was very entertaining and thought provoking. started this season and was disappointed at the change of venue.
B009SJ3GUK,Sadcelticlady,5,Love the twisted ins and outs of the plots ! Great series ! Always the best programs on prime ! I dropped other programming prime has all I need !
B009SJ3GUK,Samantha English,5,Great show with a great plot. Some pretty revolting scenes but overall a great show
B009SJ3GUK,Sharon,1,I didn't like it at all.  The same characters are used as in the first season playing different parts.  I didn't find it interesting but more on the bizarre & weird side.  There was no &#34;tie in&#34; into the first season's parts played by the same actors like I had hoped.  The writers are borrowing from aliens to &#34;Snake Pit&#34; to Hitler's reign with no continuity.
B009SJ3GUK,Shawn L Durham,1,Violent and heartless.  No storyline that I can tell except how brutel can people be to each other. Don't buy.
B009SJ3GUK,Skillet Black "Three Seasons",5,I love this series. The first season had me hooked. I love twisted! The characters leave you thinking.....their development is great without spoon feeding it to the watcher. Your left with your own mind to figure out why the insane look more normal than you do. If shows like &#34;JigSaw&#34; bore you...this is the series for you. I like the gore....but gore without justification is just stupid. No killer just kills....there is always reasons behind the kill. This series is so good....you almost root for the insane guy....almost! This is like taking a nice long drag on a cigarette...when you haven't smoked in 10 years. You get a bit heady hearing the tobacco burn as you begin to inhale....the glow of the cigarette comes to life as you inhale. You hold it just for a few seconds to get that little buzz only a cigarette can give (That is what this series is like...) and before you know it your exhaling.... the grey of the smoke washing over your body and it's all over too soon. Your left wanting more!!!
B009SJ3GUK,techie mike,5,I hope that every season just gets better and better.  I so look forward to enjoying this show when the new season begins.
B009SJ3GUK,Uncle Dale,4,I love fiction with good guys and bad guys. This show has them all. It's just creepy enough to be real. That in itself will scare you to death. It's a tough thing to watch when evil prevails.
B009SJ3GUK,Vickie Staton "Quickvick",5,The first season was awesome and so is this one!  You never know what will happen next!!! HIGHLY recommend!Thea acting is so good and the suspense will keep you watching!
B009SJ3GUK,wtchy1,5,Loved first season.. loved second season. Looking forward to what they come up with for the next &#34;American Horror Story&#34;
B009TKQREA,Charles Van Cleef,4,if you are reading this review you already know what the show is about in season three is no disappointment. Definitely worthwhile and worth the money
B009TKQREA,Chuck St. Louis "The Saint",2,Stupid is as stupid does. What a cluster f.... mess These poor souls find disaster everyway they go. I finally started feeling sorry for them but most of there woes they bring on themselves. If you are really bored maybe watch it.Chuck
B009TKQREA,debby,5,Great reality show 5 starsLove to watch an American Dream come TrueWould Highly Recommend this Show to anyone who loves an Adventure.
B009TKQREA,Fred D. Lewis "Derf8me",5,This show takes in all the ups and downs of trying to become financially independent and creating a team effort to achieve success.
B009TKQREA,Jennifer  Sahlberg,5,Amazing!!!! Go team Hoffman! I love being a prime member.....Please don't cancel this show like all the other good ones
B009TKQREA,leo clark "bob",2,I would not pay to watch this show it reruns constantly on regulartv. most of these guys don't know what they are doing. they are diggingup gravel and dirt thinking are are going to be millionaires. the mostexciting thing is figuring what the next crisis is going to be andwhich piece of makeshift equipment is going to break next.
B009TKQREA,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,my husband love this show he is addcited to it and loves it very much and will not turn it off.
B009TKQREA,Pattye Heuer,5,its amazing what these guys have to put up with for a little gold! Don't knkow if i could do it! Love this show. Wish I didn't have to pay for each episode!
B009TKQREA,susan,5,since i get the bill he watches the favorites he likes or the newest avail he must like it i havent watched it yet
B009VB7RRS,Don Montgomery,2,Christopher has been in too many dark works since leaving Dr. Who---I loved him in that role and really missed him. Who needs one more crummy politician----
B009VB7RRS,Felicity Springthorpe,3,Well played by Chris Eccleston. Really believed his distress as his life unravels in a series of flashbacks caused by his destructive alcoholism.
B009VB803S,Agustine,4,The story kept the kids entertained for almost three days. It gave me a major break from their antics. Even I liked it until the kids made me see it over and over and over...
B009VB803S,E. Helms,5,My daughter and I have enjoyed the Disney Fairies movies and shorts. Well done and smooth quality animation. Not stiff animation like other direct to DVD animated movies.
B009VB803S,JCraul,5,My daughter loves it.  Wants to watch it as soon as she gets up in the morning. Not focused on tinkerbell but she does make an appearance.
B009VSK00W,Anne Lee,3,I didn't enjoy this program about a young woman who tries to con all her roommates in NYC.  Their isn't anything funny about stealing money or bothering your roommate while she is at work.
B009VW5BLQ,becca,5,One of the few shows that makes me laugh it loud! Quick humor ....so much fun!!I hope they renew it for many more seasons!!!
B009VW5BLQ,Shanbear16,5,Happy Endings is one of the best comedies on network TV right now. This season has been hilarious and so well done. I'm so grateful that Amazon has it as an Instant Video watch!
B009VW5BLQ,TJC,4,This show always has at least a few really great gags. I find myself laughing out loud (even one time in the airport while waiting for my plane...pretty embarrassing but unavoidable!). The ensemble is very good.
B009WJXC0U,Artemus Returns,3,The most interesting part of this story as that the starts didn't survive this episode. It will be intersting to see what happens in hte fuure. Not a movie for the faint of heart to be sure.
B009WJXC0U,E. Matsuoka "12th Level TV SciFi/Fantasy Watcher",1,I tried to like this movie but couldn't. Too much non-sensical violence and so many stone faces you think they filmed this thing on a really grimy Easter Island. Jean Claude looks desperate as if going through the motions and Dolph looks like he hates being in this mess. Someone needs to tell the makers of this movie arty shots do not make up for a turgid plot.
B009X5BDT0,Carmen M Colon,4,It was a much better show that less of the personal stuff was shown. The rivalry is interesting but my sons and I put this on to see what magic these talented folks could create. We were not disappointed. The challenges weren't silly as some had been in the past and we saw real talent emerge.
B009X5BDT0,Lisa M Wiley,5,I love the whole series.  This is good too.  I wouldn't necessarily call them all all-stars but they were memorable.
B009X5BDT0,Skot,5,It's worth the $2.99 in HD (or $1.99 regular) to watch these episodes without the constant commercial interruptions found on the MyLifetime tv streaming. Thank you Amazon Instant Video.
B009X5BDT0,S. Quinn,4,Great group of designers and more actual designing and making clothes with less air time spent on bickering and out-of-workroom nonsense.
B009XOJQF4,Craig S. Werner "The Grumpy Old Squid",1,This movie circa 1950 is poorly done by today's standards.Plot is not believable not at all realistic.Some bigger names in the cast but acting is poor.I do not recommend this movie.
B009XOJQF4,Larry Snider,2,Acting was very poor and plot was not good with many unbelievable events included. Would not recommend unless you are really &#34;in&#34; to old war movies.
B009XPFV9S,Co-op Granny,3,Some overly dramatic situations and often unbelievable. Like the transformations but difficult to believe some people that stupid. Still has some entertainment value.
B009XPFV9S,TheMaximusKane,5,No matter how many bad kitchens we see; no matter how many times Gordon yells; no matter how many times he tries to save one of the restaurants it never gets old.  Gordon Ramsey's latest season was one of the best with the most shocking of all the season with the very last Episode at Amy's Baking Company.  If you are waiting for the new season that is set to premier sometime this year (spring/summer 2014) where Gordon will revisit Amy's Baking Company after he really walked out on them is titillating.  You definitely want to catch up before the new season starts and this is one of the best seasons of the series.
B009YDGLM0,Kathy Miller,5,My friend has this movie and I didn't have the chance to watch the whole series so bought my own to watch it.
B009YMLO00,Spike,5,How can you NOT love the Venture Bros.  The only bad thing is that there isn't more episodes made quicker to watch.  The Halloween special was a crack up and poor Hank found out the &#34;secret&#34;.
B009ZQGL5I,Donna L. Sako,4,The plot kept you wondering where it was going. The ending made sense. Not the thriller I expected but a good crime drama.
B009ZQGL5I,Gerry C. "Gerry",4,Numerous unexpected twists and turns in this plot. If your looking for something worthwhile to watch this one does not dis-appoint. If your from Michigan- the territory covered will be  familiar to you. Dont watch with the kids.
B009ZQGL5I,goldenbear5,5,This show was really good. Everyone did a great job on it and as you can only imagine Charlie did a great job playing the long lost (or imprisoned) son in this movie. I was curious what he would be like apart from sons of anarchy but I was definitely not disappointed. In addition I can not remember the actors name but he plays the criminal in this flick and he also did an incredible job. I would definitely say that it was well worth watching. In fact I will probably watch it again.
B009ZQGL5I,Jeffrey R. Barry,3,This is a fairly drawn out manhunt with predictable plot twists. The story line is a little long in the tooth.  You will cheer a little for the heroine and hiss at the villan.
B009ZQGL5I,John,4,This movie had great promise but the lead character did some strange things. He was way too nice for a psychopath. BUt some parts of it were really good.
B009ZQGL5I,Mary Jaeger "Mary",5,Deadfall was full of the action that my husband and I love. It had a lot of good actors in it to make it even better.
B009ZQGL5I,Pixie,4,I thought it was an okay movie. I thought the 2 characters that were brother & sister had a different type of brother & sister relationship...a bit taboo for me.
B009ZQGL5I,Raven "Raven",2,I think this was a really good film it seemed short but It was enjoyable. I think if you liked FROZEN or WOLFS or love films with some violence but not overdone with it... films done in the snow... you will love this.
B009ZQGL5I,Richard "Fun_to_know",2,Storyline was predictable after the first 30 minutes and a polite psycho is not really believable. It was good to see Kenny Rodgers again though
B009ZQGL5I,Rick,4,Deadfall is a really good thriller in a blizzard. Two separate stories converge during the snow storm and you will be entertained the entire time. A perfect movie to watch in the winter. The British actors have a very good American accent (the brother and the boxer). If you like the late night type of thrillers then you will love this one.
B009ZQGL5I,Robert W. Evans,5,it was really good  movie  it keeped me interested in watch it all the way throughI would reccomend to anyone
B009ZQGL5I,rose,5,although I have not seen this yet..I think any movie with Charlie Hunnam will be just fine. Hope he is interviewed
B009ZQGL5I,TD,5,I am a huge Charlie Hunman fan so I might be a little bias. It was a short movie that git got straight to the point.  Just the right amount of suspense and drama.
B009ZQGL5I,Uncle Dale,3,Good acting in that you despise Eric Bana. Lots of action. The story makes you wonder if the police can really be that stupid.
B009ZQT4G6,Diane K. Wilson,4,Very interesting storyline and absolutely gorgeous visually. Not the usual &#34;here comes the happy happy bride&#34; film. Very good casting.
B00A05WQ0C,Day Fan,5,I really enjoyed this movie because of Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  I could never say anything bad about either star.
B00A0G14DQ,CAR GUY,4,NEVER EAT CRABS AGAIN!  WHERE DOES ALL THE CHICKEN POOP END UP?  JUST KIDDING......  SOME SCENES MAKE YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEAT.  FICTIONAL TOWN.  LIVED IN MD 50+ YEARS AND COULD NOT FIND IT ON THE MAP (THANK GOD!)
B00A0G14DQ,Cward55,4,This is your average found footage movie but a different kind of plot that I have never really scene before. I can't tell you what it is but it's really gross and get you squirming. Overall it's actually way better than expected and it's worth a watch for sure. Check it out when you get the chance.
B00A0G14DQ,Eric Hoover,2,Not a great movie.  If you can watch it for free that go for it.  My bet is that you turn it off after about 15 minutes.
B00A0G14DQ,Gerbear,3,Not the worst thing I have seen but really a 2.5.  If you are totally bored and have nothing better to do... you will live.  Keep the remote handy so you can skip along.
B00A0G14DQ,Janice E. Garver,4,Worth watching. I had a hard time with the first few minutes watching the actress give the tv interview. Found her to be quite irritating. The movie was good and makes you wonder if the government is able to cover up incidences like this in reality.
B00A0G14DQ,Katmomma,5,I was at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.  Wow!  I am recommending this to others for sure.  It makes you think and it makes one wonder what this world is coming to because of all the crap from various sources polluting this planet.  There are consequences of greed.
B00A0G14DQ,Kelly,2,Good concept but the build up was drug out. I found myself falling asleep a few times. The acting was good but te &#34;live footage&#34; made me feel dizzy and sick. It was hard to stay in suspense with the shacking vibe.
B00A0G14DQ,Lisa,1,I understand the concept but this film was horrible. Don't waste your few dollars....go to Star----- and get a coffee instead !
B00A0G14DQ,microsoft is not monop,3,This movie scared the pants offa me.I guess my imagination was tapped by the film.Like zombie movies it is not a good film but it is scary and thus worth a watch.Some of the themes were not complete like is there a conspiracy??It is done in the I found a camera later after a coverup kinda way but its never explained what ended up really happening???
B00A0G14DQ,norma jean kringer,5,This movie is not too far from the future if we don't change something soon.  I will probably watch this a few more times.
B00A0G14DQ,Ron Baker,2,If you watch any of the SyFy channels self produced movies then you'll know what to expect. Has some entertainment value but don't expect good special effects.
B00A0G14DQ,Stella,3,If you have nothing else to do and want to see a movie to kill sometime or brain cells this is the movie for you.
B00A15H4Z8,B. Merrill,5,Tim Allen plays a great part in this show if you want to laugh and relate to family life this is a great show. He outdoes himself in this one.
B00A1TV8F6,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",4,There are many videos out there and this one teaches animal species as well as a little spanish mixed in.
B00A1TV8F6,Kristin L. Weiner,5,My boys love Diego. This was a fun season with some Holiday Episodes included. Perfect timing with Halloween and Christmas just around the corner.
B00A1TV8F6,Linda Wilson,5,Granddaughter watches this and never get bored. She well watch it over and over I can hardly get her to play with toys.
B00A1TV8F6,Manismi,5,Both my sons loved watching Diago. It is very informative and adventurous and kids love the title song too. It increases the knowledge about the animals.
B00A1TV8F6,romansjoy,5,My three year old watches this on her kindle EVERY day over and over again!
B00A1ZUZ0Y,Crzyoldone,2,Nothing new here. Move along. Even my son-in-law who used to love this show is bored by it. Catch the damn thing and put these shows out of business.
B00A1ZUZ0Y,Dennis Maloney,5,I like to keep an open mind about the paranormal and cryptids but I'm definitely on the fence about whether Sasquatch/Bigfoot is real.  Therefore it's no big surprise to me when they find no real hard evidence aside from the occasional footprint.  The group is fun and their dedication is commendable.
B00A1ZUZ0Y,scooty,5,I love watching finding bigfoot! They are getting closer and closer to finding evidence that the science feild needs to prove to them and the world that bigfoot does in deed exsits!
B00A1ZV2KG,Barbara,5,This is an excellent show for little ones of all ages. The characters are all adorable and cute. All three of my grandsons love it.
B00A1ZV2KG,Cathy,5,Wish there were more episodes/seasons! My son enjoys it so much...and I've even watched and enjoyed it as well.  Very cute and recommend for toddlers.  He has learned a variety of phrases/sentence and some concepts.
B00A1ZV2KG,naty0975,5,This is amazing. My daughter watch this every day.  I think it is really funny also.  It really helps your kids to learn.
B00A27PMLI,Adam,4,I don't remember how I heard about this but I watched once myself and then again with my wife.  You just really like these guys by the end.  There television show is also very uplifting despite being shot by MTV
B00A27PMLI,Nuttya22,5,This show is very good.  You never know what is going to happen.  It never ceases to amaze me.  The host if personable and fun to watch.  The show keeps you riveted.
B00A2KIMH6,AER,5,I'm hooked. I like the relationship between Joe and Vera. Lots of murder and mayhem in quiet? North Umberland. Who'd a thought?
B00A2KIMH6,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,4,The personal dynamics between Brenda Blethyn and David Leon keep this series moving. The intrigue behind discovery of the perpetrators as the stories delve deeper into the principals' personal lives makes this series an interesting one to follow.
B00A2KIMH6,cg showalter,5,Brenda is an amazing ACTOR AND MAKES ME THINK SHE REALLY IS A DETECTIVE. IT'S S GREAT SHOW. I'M SO GLAD I FOUND IT ON AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO...
B00A2KIMH6,Deanna R Taylor,5,She's my favorite detective.  Complicated persona which probably makes her very good at her job.  A sharp mind for detail and human nature.
B00A2KIMH6,Gae O.,5,Vera's gruff demeanor with the police officers she supervises is almost as enjoyable as her crime-solving abilities. A fun who-dunnit to settle in with. Vera is a totally enjoyable character.
B00A2KIMH6,grace,5,have watched entire series.  excellent story line and character development.  holds attention from episode to episode with new story but ongoing issues within lives of major character.  excellent acting
B00A2KIMH6,Greg V,4,Interesting cases and characters as well as scenery and ambience.  It is worth watching even if you have read the novels.
B00A2KIMH6,Harlan Kamm,5,Great acting and really good stories.  I also enjoy the English countryside and beaches.
B00A2KIMH6,Jennifer Faries,5,British crime dramas are so different than US crime dramas.  Most times there is much less guts and mayhem.  It is more of a mystery and the inspectors and just not like the US ones.  Watch this series and you will see what I mean.  It is great.
B00A2KIMH6,J. Kaplan "JJ",5,I loved Vera.  A very human person dealing with her personal life and solving complicated crimes.  Vera deals with the death of her father - whom she has a complicated relationship with - and actually moves into his home.  She discards the remnants of his life - dead animals - and makes his home HER home.  I loved Vera.  Her sidekick is perfect - he supports her because he knows how brilliant Vera is.  Amazing woman.  I love her. She is everywoman.
B00A2KIMH6,Katherine B. Brewton,5,My husband and I both love this series.  We are  in our 70's and enjoy most British shows.  We love the main character that is played beautifully by Brenda Blethyn.  She show her weaknesses as well as her strengths.  Joe is a great &#34;side-kick&#34; with his &#34;young family man issues&#34;.  Each crime to be solved shows the &#34;human&#34; side of life both good and bad.  Hope they continue the series.
B00A2KIMH6,Kathleen M Thomas,4,Still enjoying this show.  Was really bummed out after I finished Season 2 that the next Season was not available for free!
B00A2KIMH6,Meredith Arnold,5,Well done with characters that are realistic while holding tension if needed.  The stories are very challenging to figure out and unpredictable which I love.
B00A2KIMH6,Pamela M. Johnson,5,Love this British mystery series..focuses on the characters and plot as opposed to latest fashions and hairdos..wish there were more episodes in the series..Brenda Blethyn is wonderful..
B00A2KIMH6,srrogers50,5,I just happened upon this series and have really enjoyed it. I hope they continue to make many more seasons.
B00A2KIMH6,The Gigi,4,But don't let the outward appearance of Vera fool you...she's one smart lady.  Her sidekick really wants to learn from her how refreshing instead of stepping over her into the number one position.
B00A2KIMH6,Tom Stevenson,5,please add more.  this is such a wonderful edgy series.  I love the British dramas and tv series and have many friends are in agreement.  We hunger for more.  Thanks for this one.
B00A2KIMH6,V. Pettus,5,An unlikely lead character keeps you intrigued in this series.  The plots are good and the actors are great.  Highly recommend as an alternative to all of the carefully manicured leads we see in U.S. TV series.
B00A2KIMH6,Wiliam Myers,4,Always enjoy this series -- looking forward to season #3 --- once it's on Prime
B00A2KV89U,Another opinion,3,Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining.  The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass.  But Season 3 is better than season 4.
B00A2KV89U,His Beloved,4,I believe shows like these are very cathartic. You can watch and better understand some of the dynamics of past and present workings in relationships.
B00A2KV89U,Lynn4399,5,Yolanda is far to classy for this show. Loved the episode of her dinner party and the singing around the piano tradition.. Now that was entertainment. Leave Paul and Adriennda (sp) alone!  Good luck with your sobriety Kim.
B00A2KV89U,S. Ortega,1,I've watched all seasons but couldn't finish this one. Brandi's racial remarks and then Lisa's husband's remarks to maid when she asked for just one dress of the many  that Lisa was giving away. All the maid said is she wished she could have one. And he jumped all over her ugh! That did it for me. This show has gone down hill. Nobody gets along anymore. Atleast before there were some fun times. Like I said after the maid thing I was done. Too bad I spent my money on this. That just gives all of them them more money . Like they need anymore than they have already.
B00A2M9SEK,ddddd,3,the series is interesting and very informative. The characters make the show
B00A2M9SEK,George Klander,5,can't get enough of this series.  could easily overdose ina weekend if more episodes were available for free.  Just enjoy it.
B00A2M9SEK,J. B. Miller,2,This show seems boring to us
B00A2M9SEK,Jeni,5,I love this show and that it's available on Prime. every season Pawn Stars becomes more entertaining although I find Corey more annoying.
B00A2M9SEK,john mager,5,always watch that show!  only now i watch it on another device. as i did this one. liked this epe. because of the birthday. teaseing the poor guy! and giving him ? a must see .
B00A2M9SEK,Moo,5,Every show is great with things to learn and laughter to be had. Don't miss this show well worth your time.
B00A2M9SEK,Richard L Thompson,5,A very informative show.  Love every episode.  I hope they continue to bring us more quality entertainment.  Love Chumlee.  He gets a lot of abuse.
B00A2M9SEK,Ruby Chrisman,5,We really enjoy this show. The history is very interesting and we love watching the family interact. You never know what new gaget or book or gun or toy you will see next.  My whole family enjoys the show.
B00A2M9SEK,S. CONRAD,5,I gave it five stars because this is fun to watch. you never know whats going to come into the pawn shop. some items are very rare and worth a lot of money. I recommend this show to everyone.
B00A2M9SEK,Speedynyc,4,Diversify your knowledge while being entertained.  It's how all classes should be taught. Also get a few tips on how to neogtiate with a pawn broker.
B00A2M9SEK,sue m,5,Get rid of money and have them teach us how to barder. We can learn economics from these guys. Chumlee is a great sidekick.
B00A3S4XVQ,Hpsweet,5,My daughter and I watch this religiously!  Itsa great to watch how creative some of these chefs are! Well done!
B00A65FXH4,Amazon Customer,3,I purchased the first six episodes for my kiddo hoping and praying there would be no puppets as there are in half of the season 1 episodes. No such luck. My kid loves Caillou but every time there is a puppet "intermission" between shorts the kindle gets slapped silly until the cartoon is back on. It would be nice if Amazon would mark which episodes have these ridiculous puppet shows.
B00A65FXH4,Christa Douglas,5,My 3 year old girls love this show. Each episode is focused on lessons and skills children can use in their everyday life. Caillou is fun and adventurous making the show even more appealing.
B00A65FXH4,E B Fricks,5,Check out the display case the week of September 16-20th for constitution week.  Stop by the LRC and add your signature to the constitution.
B00A65FXH4,Jeannie,5,I enjoy watching Caillou with my 3 year old granddaughter.  He goes on so many adventures and it teaches that if things don't always go as you like it.  Find a way to still have fun and enjoy whatever adventure you are on.
B00A65FXH4,racergal,5,This is my grandson's favorite show and with Amazon prime he can watch it anytime! Caillou really makes an impact on kids.
B00A65FXH4,Rebecca Snell "boulder50",5,My grandson looks at all the shows.  He sings all the sons. Very pleased with this show through amazon video
B00A6LSZFU,Mal,4,I love Adventure Time but let me tell you that this season is EXTRA off the wall and weird. Almost too weird so some episodes are not that enjoyable.
B00A6LSZFU,Paul Aguirre,5,Great cartoon one the best cartoons CN has made or produced in a long time if you love cartoons I recommend this one very strongly
B00A6LSZFU,SilverJade451,5,This seasons adds a lot more to the characters and the overall world of Ooo.  I can't wait to see where they go from here.
B00A6LSZFU,Yar,5,this is a great show and my 5 year old son loves it.  he will watch it over and over
B00A8D136Y,Larry Snider,2,Strange movie that had a very strange ending. Acting was average and story line OK but not great. Not a great movie but acceptable.
B00A8D136Y,maryoneal,1,I was disappointed in the casting / especially the walk on by Nancy Grace- you got to know whento step aside.  Some one professional should have taken over.  A terrible waste of energy.
B00A8D18ZA,Barbara A. Talley,5,I only saw a couple episodes of The Shield's last season and was sorry I didn't get started from the beginning. Now that it is streaming on Amazon Prime via my ROKU I started with season one episode one and I'm now almost through season 2. I love Michael Chiklis in this role. You can be sure that I will watch every episode of every season and will be sorry when it is over.
B00A8D18ZA,barbie "doggy mom",5,This is an extrmely suspensful TV show. It keeps you on your toes. As the title sugests; this is a cop related TV show. If I say anymore Ill spoil it. Awesome TV show for all the supense lovers out there.
B00A8D18ZA,CVB,5,Never saw this when it was on network; awesome that I found it on Amazon Prime. Fantastic acting; great characters; gritty drama. Can't stop watching.
B00A8D18ZA,E. arroyo "papa che",5,Season 2 does not disappoint. It follows Vic and his boys through a maze of obstacles and hurdles to achieve their selfish ends.This is a great series and remains very timely in the issues that are raised with drama and humorous moments that keep you coming back for more.
B00A8D18ZA,flyfish,5,I like Chiklis for his rough cop roll...Action and story lines always grab you...I would not rec. for the younger set !!
B00A8D18ZA,Happy Camper,5,Season Two has the Barn fleshed out.  All characters are in their spots and seem to know what their functions and jobs are supposed to be.  Dutch begins to show his skills as a detective and profiler.  Aceveda eyes a seat on the city council.  Vic's home life starts unraveling and a drug dealer has got the Strike Team on edge.  Ronnie gets burned - badly.
B00A8D18ZA,J. B. Miller,5,This has become one of our favorite TV shows. Amazing writing. Full of plot & gut wrenching action. Enjoy JB
B00A8D18ZA,linda21,5,Great show. Amazon has better shows then Netflix as far as I am concerned. The shield is funny to me it's really good the characters are great
B00A8D18ZA,Marilyn Lee "The BookRook",5,Every season gets better and better.  The actors are awesome and the writer of this show knows how to keep you coming back for more.  I have watched all 7 seasons and just want more.
B00A8D18ZA,Mark Ackles,4,I gave this rating due to how well the TV show is setup and how in real life there are police officers that would do the same things if not worse. I recommend checking it out if you are in to law TV series.
B00A8D18ZA,MaryAnn,5,It is almost too real.  Excellent acting.Have to pay close attention to understand.Can be overwhelming and complicated.Truth is hard.
B00A8D18ZA,nurse_judith,5,I love the actors and the drama that gets more involved after watching each show.  The Season 2 is really great police drama that draws you in and won't let you go.  The many street characters are believable and scary.  This is how the streets in many city's are.  Living in a cop family...you know the stories are real.
B00A8D18ZA,Pamela S. Halbig,4,Very good series.  Not your typical cop show.  You get connected to all the characters and their lives. I plan on watching all the seasons.
B00A8D18ZA,Reggie,5,Series really holds up well. Give it a shot. Grottier than newer series. Has good characters and story plots. The intro music is great.
B00A8D18ZA,Richard Newton,5,Too often shows decline as they go along. This 2nd year was every bit as good as the first. I love how there are no good or bad guys. The bad guys have redeeming qualities and the good guys have some seriously distorted things going on.
B00A8D18ZA,William R. Kolbe,5,It just seems I can't get enough of these shows.  I'm already on season five.
B00A8P9AG2,JCruea10,5,Love this show!  There are times I get aggravated at Kody in it for some of the things he says to the wives but all in all a lot of people could learn good life lessons from this family weather or not they believe in this lifestyle!
B00A8P9AG2,Tanesha L. Barkley,5,Enjoyable moments with the blended plural marriage of Kody Brown and his four wives with their 17 children how they deal with their lives and day to day issues which we all could learn from. I love this family show what working together can do !
B00A954YS0,Amazon Customer,5,I loved this show got hooked and watched every show before I stopped.It is so nice to see a NON American Show with lots of talentAnd I was crying my eyes out from the dramatic last show in the series....
B00A954YS0,Amazon Customer,5,Very good series too bad its not shown in America but excellent show with great story lines with lessons to be learned at the end
B00A954YS0,I. McKinzie,5,I loved this series ... and then it got so sad !!!  I had no idea it was going to do that to me ... and I cried so hard !  Wow ! It was a surprise ! I just wish it was still on ... made me sad that it ended :-(  I want more !!!
B00A954YS0,Joyce,5,Beautiful dancing along w/ realistic and often heart-wrenching glimpses of young students as they strive to do their best while maneuvering through varying emotional crisis.
B00A9Q5GR2,Dog Friendly,5,I'm still trying to decide why we cannot produce as many strong television series as the BBC.  This has become one of my favorite shows.
B00A9Q5GR2,E3 "E3",5,I still can't believe there was only two seasons of this series.  They seriously leave American television productions in their dust.
B00A9Q5GR2,Ginger L. Gilmore,4,At the start it was a very solid drama with bits of comedy. Now it has moved in to predictable status.
B00A9Q5GR2,Judy Kazlauskis "JudyK",4,About dedicated journalists that would do anything for a story.  I thought it was well done and their personal stories blended inquite well.
B00A9Q5GR2,Justicried,5,In this season we leave the world of spys and enter into the world of organized crime.  The characters drive the story and the mystery/discovery again keeps it going.  This season shows how much relationships can effect character development.  How even when a person is on the bottom rung of their character other people can help them climb back to their best.  How much depth can sometimes be hidden beneath a shallow exterior.  The characters are definitely not preachy but many of them have a solid hidden strength.  I really thought they laid the groundwork for season 3 in some of the story line and I wish it had continued.
B00A9Q5GR2,Karen L. Ball,5,Loved the show. Enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Loved the plot lines. Always intreguing. Would love to see a 3rd season.
B00A9Q5GR2,Mark Price "Laborman",5,All the great acting and subplots in an adult drama missing from most American junk aimed at pre-teens.  Sort of the British version of the Newsroom.
B00A9Q5GR2,southerntothecore "richard",4,Season two is just a interesting and enjoyable as season one. The show in season 2 got tighter and better because the cast rally started to jell as an ensemble. I would like to see some more...
B00A9Q5GR2,Steve Lawrence,5,This is a very good series based in the late '50s. I would look forward to more from Amazon on this. It's a definitely watch series.
B00A9Q5GR2,Who Am I? "Me!",5,That pretty much sums up what I have to say.  These are probably the only two actors I would fly anywhere to watch if I had the money AND THEY ARE BOTH IN THE SAME SHOW.  The entire cast is wonderful.  The Hour is a series that you MUST watch. Even though it ends after only two seasons. :(With all the forgettable crap that is on TV nowadays I'm of the belief that cancelling such a triumph of Television such as this will be looked back on as a great crime to the arts and humanity.  These producers who cancelled it will have God to answer to when they die for committing this crime.- I'm serious. :(
B00A9QGKTK,Michael Cooper,3,Mysterious trip into the woods and the disastrous results that follow. Much of the problems caused by the ineptness of the kids themselves.
B00A9QGKTK,Seattle Reader,1,I quit after 15 minutes. The main reason was the lighting. The night scenes you could hardly see the characters. I also didn't get how they were framing the shots.
B00A9QGKTK,Selena,1,I guess it could of been ok... I really don't know because the beginning did not interest me and therefore...I feel asleep on it.
B00AA7OI5G,Teddy and Me "JLEE",4,I enjoyed this movie. It was just a very good down to earth story about a NYC Irish family and their struggles and dynamics. Also about forgiveness and that is always a good thing....
B00AAA8JSK,mb4574,1,Lasted about 30 min.  Not my type of naked women. I didn't feel it was worth the $3 I spent.
B00ABD0AOM,Customer,1,This tv show is very boring and poorly animated. And for a show that is supposed to be an action comedy show there is practically no action. The how to train your dragon series is just very overrated. I cant believe they are making a sequel to the horrible first movie.
B00ABD0AOM,JJ,5,This is a great show for show for the younger set!  My Grandchildren love it!  We all set and watch it together!
B00ABD0AOM,J. Neal "OSUJillyBean",5,Excellent audio and video quality.  Episodes are short (maybe 22 minutes each) because Americans are trained to expect excessive ads when you watch TV on cable.  A fun series for fans of HTTYD and a continuation of the two seasons of &#34;Riders of Berk&#34;.
B00ABD0AOM,Preacher Morris,5,This is a good continuation of the movie.  My son is always asking me when I have purchased the next episode.
B00ABD0AOM,putder53,5,PERFECT FOR KIDS. THE STORYS HAVE A LESSON TO BE LEARNED. AS WELL AS FUN TO WATCH. THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.
B00ADHOMZ4,beth holman,5,Good movie on greatest love stories at its time.  I declension it to all there fans.  It was long enough covered everything.
B00ADHOMZ4,Book Lover "Black Book Lover",2,Ok so I bought this movie because it was 99cents. The only reason I plan to keep it is because in the future if anyone asks what happened to Lindsay Lohan's career I can just show them this film.
B00ADHOMZ4,singer "mg",1,This is a cheap bad film with bad acting about a Hollywood icon.  Save your 99 cents. You'd be better off watching an episode of the-its so bad its hard to watch- 'Honey Boo-boo'
B00ADHOMZ4,Xicily,4,i found the movie entertaining.  My knowledge of the relationship between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton was very limited. I enjoyed watching the movie and seeing how they got together and what an unique relationship it was. A must for Taylor and Burton fans.
B00ADYXDUC,Alicia Yates,5,I added it to my library for my daughter but I must admit that I rather enjoy the show myself. It is a cute show Marvin is always into something!
B00ADYXDUC,jraff,4,our daughter said it's better than any other disney or nick show she's seen. wishes it went further than 2 seasons.
B00ADYXDUC,M. Campbell,5,This show is fun to watch and Marvin is a very funny character. He is the human form of Alf!
B00AEFSISW,Christa Douglas,5,This is a really great series. The bears are friendly and each episode has friendly lessons about sharing and caring. My 3 year olds love it.
B00AEFSISW,E. Yeager,5,The carebear series teaches the young children about feelings and how to express them. All this in an entertaining story.
B00AEFSISW,Rubydoo67,5,Daughter loves Care Bears.  This cartoon is always safe for small children and good morL lessons. Video quality is excellent
B00AF6073Y,Blue Bell "Blue Bell",2,Well it started slowly and never made a momentum.  I turned it off after 30 mints may be if you watch it longer it would make sense.
B00AF6073Y,FUBAR-EOD,5,Believable story that could be from BBC headlines!  Violent scenes proportional to story sequence with no extreme added special effects.  Addresses emerging issues concerning water rights in developing countries.  Ending sequence can have multiple meanings dependent upon viewers perceptions.
B00AF6073Y,j,4,This movie was a nice surprise - all of the actors gave good performances and Garcia shines as usual. This is worth the time..
B00AF6073Y,sharon kemm,5,what's the old saying- the truth hurts. something like this happens all over the world. I don't like it but it does.
B00AFUFBT0,alicia myers,5,this is the type of shows they should have on today. not who can fart the loudest! its a show not real life but at least it has substance!
B00AFUFBT0,Joan Bachman,4,I don't always agree with their philosophies but I enjoy the comedy and acting.  I also like the interaction between parents and children.
B00AG8VPTG,BarbaraKButler,5,Scary situations: real life. One gets into the feelings both the victim\s and 911 operators are feeling when this is happening.
B00AG8VPTG,Diane L. Nusser,3,Maybe even 2.5 stars. Lots of repeating-hello I don't need to watch the same thing 4 times. Terrible camera work. Bought 1 episode. Won't by another.
B00AG8VPTG,Jacob Crampton,3,I love true crime and reality shows. This show was interesting and I enjoyed it but it is not one of my favorites.
B00AG8VPTG,JCook,5,I found each episode very interesting. I like the way they use the actual 911 recordings and then commentary from those involved in each incident. I would watch every episode available!
B00AG8VPTG,S. CONRAD,5,I gave it five stars because I thank it is a very good show to watch. it has real 911 calls that are acted out to see. I recommend this to everyone.
B00AG8VPTG,Steve Talamantes,4,I like this show a lot. It's really suspenseful. I wish there were more episodes per season. Can't wait to see more.
B00AG8VPTG,worddancer "Perspicacious professor",1,Why are things like this on tv?We don't have enough senseless violence in this country? Enough people who get off on others' misery?
B00AH8SPOI,CEPeters,5,My three year old daughter LOVES these guys and has now for the past year.  Teaches her quite a bit about animals.
B00AH8SPOI,Junior "Clouseau",5,My 4 year old Grandson loves watching Wild Kratts on TV so this was a no-brainer for the car.  Thank You.
B00AH8SPOI,lLily,5,Watching real live animals and seeing how they grow is interesting in many different ways.This movie is amazing my daughters watched it again and again.
B00AHPCQFK,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",5,This ensemble cast is so good together that it is hard to believe that they don't actually live together in Cleveland sharing an array of hilarious experience as each character looks for love and how to reinvent themselves anew after their lives in LA had left them feeling stuck and unattractive. It is easy to love the comedy with the sharp dialogue as well as the situation comedy and the extra bonus of great guest stars who appear on the show as a regular feature adding an extra surprise for every episode. I love this series it really makes me laugh out loud during every episode!And who can resist the charm and stand out performance by Betty White as oldest woman in the group who is not from LA but who has a really colorful background herself!
B00AHPCQFK,Dawna324,5,Whenever I need a good laugh all I need to do is watch this show. I can't think of any show funnier than Hot in Cleveland.
B00AHPCQFK,DrJoey,5,The series and in particular this episode are hysterical.  My son came into the room that night to see why I was laughing so loudly.  And how they objectify (the fire man without the shirt!) the male is sooo funny...I so enjoy the tables turned.  The best part of the series...what I enjoy the most...is the cast of characters from my "past" appearing on the show.  The only major star left... one I want to see...is VALERIE HARPER...come on...get her into the series.  To the creators and cast...THANK YOU...
B00AHPCQFK,Ellen H. Center,5,There are parts of this series that you will laugh so hard that your sides will ache!!!!  Four stars for all of the comedy veterans starring in this very funny show
B00AHPCQFK,I. Behling,5,I absolutely love this series and have so many laugh out louds experiences.  I'm glad to see that TVland is taking them on for another series!  Great taste TVland!!!
B00AHPCQFK,K'ann Strohl,5,Enjoying the shows.was able to start from season 1 and work my way up. LOVE THE SHOW! ! Got to love Betty White
B00AHPCQFK,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",5,While the show can be a bit slapstck at times.  Who could not love the all star casts!  I great break from the &#34;ususal&#34; sitcoms out there.
B00AHPCQFK,Mike,4,The show continues to be entertaining and it set the ladies up to meet new people and shows of more of their talents.
B00AHPCQFK,Nick Kaspar,5,...the ladies of &#34;Hot in Cleveland&#34; do it again!  Season 4 is just as funny and hilarious as Seasons 1-3.  The comic timing of all four of these gifted actresses is perfect.  Their talent is what makes this show so watchable and enjoyable.  Looking forward to Season 5 on Prime!
B00AHPCQFK,Patricia A. Fischetti,4,Love this show!  It is really funny so I'm laughing throughout the show.  The cast is great and they work very well together. The streaming is great!  No downloading during the show.  The sound and picture quality is excellent.
B00AHPCQFK,raten51,5,I love all the cast members they play off each other very well and for a 30 minute comedy show you can't go wrong. it's ususally good for a few laughs.
B00AHPCQFK,Rugby,4,Well the cast is very appealing and the humor well executed. Maybe not for everyone but a good time for women of a certain age.
B00AHPCQFK,simple,4,Funny ladies a decade younger Golden Girls.
B00AHPCQFK,S. Marsh,5,Love everything about this series. Looking forward to watching the new season. The cast and writing are great. That's all.
B00AHSFQMM,Capt. Colorado "RocknRoll Fan",4,This movie was a lot of fun.  Better than expected.  I guess billy bob is a selling point?  But it really is our 3 anti-heroes that make this movie rock.
B00AHSFQMM,goldenbear5,4,Better than I expected... A nice relationship between the the kid and the guy who saves him. It had a nice moral to it...in a twisted kinda way.
B00AHSFQMM,rose,5,love Travis Fimmel...anything with him in it is great..so glad it was available to buy. Like behind the scenes. yay
B00AIDXT5M,Honest Abe,4,Well worth anyone's time to watch!  Says so much about upper class culture in the American SW.  Don't miss it!
B00AIDXT5M,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,This is actually a really good movie it looks at what drives a religion. It is like wow I would so do this. It is a must see .
B00AJGAOM4,Cward55,2,I could not stand any of these characters at all just annoying low life people that just did dumb things for no reason at all. If it wasn't because of that it would be an alright alien movie. The alien was kinda cool looking and the effects weren't too bad. The overall setting and atmospherewas that good either and just felt like a rushed movie for some reason. Not a fan but that's just me and there are way better alien movies out there. If your bored than I guess check it out.
B00AJGAOM4,D. McNamara,4,We thought this was creative and a lot of fun. As an extra bonus it has Noel Clark  (Rose's boyfriend from the Doctor Who series). I love a good creature feature and this really fits the bill.
B00AJGAOM4,Ron Baker,3,Storage 24 does a pretty good job of creating tension and suspense. The effects are decidedly on the low budget side. Plays like a well done SyFy movie.
B00AJGAOM4,Route66Review,1,I felt like the producers were attempting to remake ALIENS without the big budget or a scary enough creature.  My dogs fell asleep on this one.  They'll usually watch just about anything.  Not tonight! BOOORRRIIIINNNNGGGGG!
B00AJMXSG2,D. A. Donahue,5,Catherine Bell was a really fine actress in JAG; but here in The Good Witch series of 6 movies to date she is SUPERB.  The rest of the cast is just as great and so far each of the movies that have been made available thru Amazon has been full of family style adventures.  It is a shame that as of right now there are only three of the six movies available here at Amazon and it is with great expectations that I await the next installment of The Good Witch series.  Please cast your vote and maybe we can get Amazon to see their way towards seeking them out.  Thank you for reading and pressing forth with getting family fun filled adventures available
B00AJMXSG2,M Parker,4,Good family movie. Gives a silver lining to a difficult situation. It is good comedy and drama.  My family and i really enjoyed this movie.
B00AJMXSG2,MVivar,4,It is a warm family movie full of surprises. Most of the actors seemed quite natural. Would like to get the other movies in the series.
B00AJMXSG2,Nick,5,I love watching The Good witch and was glad that the good witch's gift is coming to DVD.I do hope everyone would also like to watch the series would believe in magic as well.
B00AJUR400,M. B. Feeser,5,This is a good movie that the whole family can watch. Kevin Sorbo is really good in it. Excellent movie!!
B00AJUR400,Susan Harris,5,I love the premise of this story of a modern day Scrooge with out the Scrooge overtones and computer generated special effects. Gemma the little girl is great.
B00ALQT6MG,Amber R Burkhart,5,I love learning that what we were taught in school is no longer correct. So it opens up more doors to how many cultures traveled to this wonderful land. And all the different time periods.
B00ALQT6MG,Dennis Maloney,4,I like the ideas presented in this show and think there is a lot of evidence to back up some of the claims.  I like that he's willing to consider far out ideas and then go look for proof and will admit that the proof is not overwhelming in some cases.
B00ALQT6MG,dhar238,5,Awesome show! Not just conjecture but a real effort to find the truth. I Love this show and hope it's around to explore many more mysteries of America's past!
B00ALQT6MG,Paul Aguirre,5,good show very interesting I would recommend watching it history is both interesting and important so give this a shot
B00ALQV19C,cottageprims,4,Good show so far.We are on episode 6.Wondering how they think sometimes though.There are alot of common sense things they just don't do or think of.
B00AO1SNF4,DebbieT,5,A heartfelt movie that will bring joy to your heart and sadness at the same time. A must see family movie!
B00AO1SNF4,Gizmo "ctwin60",4,At first I thought this was going to be a Lifetime/Hallmark channel type of movie but it surprised me by actually having decent acting and a good storyline. Having a mentally ill family member back in the 50's could not have been easy since there were not many options for treatment other than institutions. This family has to deal with a mentally unstable woman who disrupts the life's of everyone who comes into contact with her. It is supposedly base on a true story but I'm sure it was embellished quite a bit. Still a good movie.
B00AO1SNF4,jonoknee,5,Wow .... a gripping and interesting Movie all the way to the end. and watch out for the surprise ending. didn't see that coming !ok not the usual guy movie but I got into it lol so watch it with your significant other ...
B00AO1SNF4,Robert J. Maceri "mongoose41",2,My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  It seemed like it would never end.
B00AO7JASM,White Raven "zxy",5,I love Portlandia because it spoofs many of the folks in my social set......including me.  I get to laugh at myself since I have live near UC Davis and yep we have everything from almond milk to rice milk.  I am a "gotta get the gear" person.  I have environmental guilt.  The relationship issues are something I experience with my friends.  But I still love the life style.  This is soap opera and sketch comedy at its best.
B00AOIJN7Y,Christopher Walter "topherwi",5,I really enjoyed watching these episodes. Comedians stopping by and saying &#34;wow this is what happened to me and guess what I it kind of funny because I look at everything as being a little humorous.
B00AOIJN7Y,K. Oliver,1,This was not funny at all. It is just an excuse for people to cus for no reason and pretend there is a legitimate reason for it.
B00AOIJRQQ,David Albright,5,I liked watching it growing up and now I am enjoying it with my kids.  I hope amazon will continue to add more older Disney cartoons to their library.
B00AOIJRQQ,Diva,5,It reminds me a bit of scooby-doo where theres a mystery and the &#34;meddling&#34; kids get involved and solve the problem. Good message and funny.
B00AP06R0M,Ran,5,It's clean fun and a lot of tough lessons to learn from others. It also helps appreciate police officers and those that risk their lives to keep us safe. I love cops!
B00APE00H4,Alicia Yates,5,Highly recommend this to anyone great series can't wait for Season 5 to be on Prime!! Wish I would have watched the series sooner!!
B00APE00H4,aloha1127,4,Very enjoyable season but the writers painted themselves in a corner and could not come up with a climatic ending. The entire season was interesting but that last episode is not justified.
B00APE00H4,Amazon Customer "Grandpa Jack",5,The show takes a different tone in Season 4 and I enjoy it very much. We have seen all the bad folks openly known to Raylon and what happens to them. This season takes a different less jovial turn. He seems a bit darker this season. Key characters are still there. When is Winona ever going to have that baby? Is Johnnie going to cross Boyd? Is Arlo going change his MO? Love it! I am loving this!
B00APE00H4,Ann,5,It's an interesting study in characters personality changes for good or bad and how people are friendly when they are opposites.  I am amazed at how awful some people are but also realize that there are people in the world that bad.  Also normal people can ge good and bad at the same time.
B00APE00H4,Annie Wilson,5,Continue to enjoy each season. Timothy Olyphant is fantastic in the lead role. Very good supporting cast and guest roles as well. Recommend.
B00APE00H4,Anon "Anon",4,far fetched. action going in every which direction without a clear enough path. You make assumptions and then you don't se that part of the story line for a while... still a great show.
B00APE00H4,artsieann,5,I love this program. I think the seasons keep getting better. I think the star of the show is get.
B00APE00H4,azloree,5,Highly entertaining TV show - can't wait to see Season 5.  One of the best written and acted series that I have seen.
B00APE00H4,Becky M. Brooks,5,I am itching to see Season 5. The problem with binge viewing is that when you reach the end of the line it's hard to wait until the next series hits the pipeline.
B00APE00H4,Bill E. Bissett,5,Great language and music.  Characters are developed very well and the one liners are priceless.  Love the chief and Raylins family
B00APE00H4,Cathy Hale,5,Most awesome show on the planet!  Timothy Olyphant is perfect to play Raylan Givens. Art is funny as heck! Love it
B00APE00H4,Cheryl Fontaine,5,Some very strong character development from all the actors. It is a pleasure to watch something that doesn't bill itself as &#34;reality TV&#34; yet continues to make me believe in what's happening.  Keep up the good work!
B00APE00H4,ChristyB,4,Really liked this program very much -- although the language isn't suited for families.  The acting is great and the story lines are very good.  Thank you Amazon for providing this program.
B00APE00H4,Craig Miller,4,Have always enjoyed the Justified series.. Great writing and the actors pull it all together. You can tell when an acting team really enjoys their work..
B00APE00H4,Darren Slawson,4,I likes it...reminds me of my childhood and stuff way back when I lived in the country and sold moonshine
B00APE00H4,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",5,I love this show.  Keeps me enjoying it each season.  Never dull moment in this series.  I would recommend it to anyone to watch.
B00APE00H4,Dave,5,Great show great characters great writing.  I think it is great so I wrote great  5 times.  Don't you think that is great?
B00APE00H4,Deb in Western NC,5,Love this show!  Liberal lacings of humor and really excellent actors make this series about a wildcard US Marshall in Harlan Kentucky a joy to watch.
B00APE00H4,Dennis Charpentier,5,This is a series that grabs you and holds. There are gray areas in everyone's life and interactions they have had in their family and in their past keeps the viewer intrigued.
B00APE00H4,Devora,5,I had to re-watch the seasons to get ready for new season and it's great can't wait for new season.
B00APE00H4,DMT,5,Timothy Olyphant is the reason I watch this show.  He is such a great actor and I can't wait to see the ending season.
B00APE00H4,Douglas A. Weber "mainstream reader",5,After watching this season we have remained hooked!  With 2 more seasons planned we look forward to the adventures of Raylon and the excellent costars and guest stars.  highly recommend this series.
B00APE00H4,Douglas Tyler,5,Love the series.  Am watching the entire series.  Will continue to watch the entire series.Disappointed that 'Breaking Bad' is not available free or at a reasonable price.
B00APE00H4,Dr. Who?,5,This show is like a modern day western. Great stories with fantastic acting. Start with the first season and work your way forward. You won't regret it.
B00APE00H4,Edward Vanzo,5,Rarely do you see a series with both excellent acting and an excellent script.  Congrats to both actors and writers.
B00APE00H4,Eileen J. Troemel "Dragonlady",5,This is one to watch and rewatch.  I enjoyed the plot twists and tangles.  The interaction between characters is wonderful.  You just know that if things had turned out slightly differently Boyd and Raylan would have either switched places or they would be partners in crime.  Beware though - there is a cliff hanger and you are going to want the next season.
B00APE00H4,Elizabeth Cavalone,5,I enjoy Justified especially the relationship between Rayland and the other characters in the cast. When Boyd and Rayland are together their dialogue is amazing.. I like the way the character of Boyd has been developed over the past seasons and in this season the character of Rayland is showing his faults more making him more true to life. Ava is given a bigger role in this season also which adds to the show.
B00APE00H4,Emily Booth,5,Really enjoyed the entire Justified TV program.  Excellent acting and writing.  This season centered on a mystery.  It was a surprise.  Waiting for Season 5 to appear on Amazon Prime.
B00APE00H4,Encino,5,This is our new favorite TV show. Lots of interesting characters and interesting story lines. Hats off to the FX network for this gem!!
B00APE00H4,Frank,5,Great acting with very believable characters as well as a story line that keeps you coming back for more. Look forward to next season.
B00APE00H4,Frank Schwarz "Specialized Marketer",4,Great acting and the characters do not get stale or boring. Very nice plots and something new around the corner.
B00APE00H4,'fred in Vermont,4,A little more violence than I would prefer but I just exit the room until the 'noise' is over and it doesn't interfere with our commitment to see the next episode.
B00APE00H4,gizzy,5,I really enjoyed this show. Can't wait till the next season is put on prime so I can see what happens next.
B00APE00H4,G. Neal "EMPEROR",4,The acting...the writing...the whole shabang works wonderfully well and delivers great television.  This is not mindless cops and robbers action; this is scintillating action.
B00APE00H4,greg,5,this is by far the best cop show on tv. its really more about the characters than anything else. the topics asuch as the drug trade and the area show are areas that many people will never see. there depiction of these area are quite good
B00APE00H4,Inky,5,The show gets a little rougher around the edges the longer it goes on but is still one of the best shows on cable TV.
B00APE00H4,Jamie,5,We've been looking for crime lords in all the wrong places! They're up country in their cabins selling their 'stuff' to penniless neighbors! The Marshal is coming to get them. I dearly love this series...
B00APE00H4,joe,5,it has a lot of internal toiles in all the actors that makes them face there morals. as well it makes them change no matter there intensions.
B00APE00H4,John V Evans,5,Action pack show that keeps you glued to the TV. Waiting for season 5 to be available for prime members.
B00APE00H4,Judith Church,4,I enjoy the complexity of the characters and stories. I like the quirkiness but something about it bothers me and I can't put my finger on what it is.
B00APE00H4,Katherine B. Brewton,5,Enjoy watching a very savay U S Marshal work his craft in one of the &#34;Under Bellys of society &#34;
B00APE00H4,Kathy,4,I am loving the character development for Nick Searcy.  The writers have given him some of the best lines in the show and everything he says makes me laugh.
B00APE00H4,Kemosabe,5,Real characters from the darker side of the human existence.  Even the good have a little of their own bad behavior.  Just as in real life nobody is all good or all bad.
B00APE00H4,kindlelover,5,Gritty. Riveting. Interesting characters. Great multi-layered storyline. Keeps you wanting more. Love my Amazon Primme  providing excellent series for FREE!
B00APE00H4,K. Munsey,5,This show is seriously the best!  Except that Raylan should cut his hair!  It is somewhat distracting to his overall cowboy look.
B00APE00H4,Kobe 519 "Genevieve Cherry-Sours",5,I absolutely love this show. We don't have any cable or satellite and when I found all the episodes on Amazon I was thrilled. I love the characters and the story line.
B00APE00H4,K. R. Merryman,5,You will be hooked after the very first episode.  Wow... you never know who is going to do what to whom!  I don't know that I have ever seen a series that continually has characters being terminated.  There is a subtle humor in the writing that really works and the acting is exactly what you would expect for the characters from the hills of Kentucky.  I say that with all due respect to growing up in very hard times.
B00APE00H4,L. G. Gerstle "East Coast Knitter",5,This continues to be an outstanding series. The acting is superb; the writing is excellent. A must see for serious viewers.
B00APE00H4,LG Henrichs,4,Loved Timothy Olyphant as the lead. hope to see him in more shows.The 4th season pulls together the other seasons. Hope there are more to come!
B00APE00H4,L,5,Can't wait to see Season 5! Timothy Olyphant is great in his role as Marshall Givens - love his swagger and his attitude. The writers of this show are fantastic -- great one liners  and dry humor!
B00APE00H4,Lisa K. Sedlmeier,5,The entire Justified series is excellent and the fourth season is no different.  It draws you in with an excellent story and bits of comedy thrown in.  I plan to own the entire series.
B00APE00H4,Louis Diana,5,Justified is a great show. Timothy Olyphant is amazing. The show always keeps you guessing and never disappoints. Highly recommended
B00APE00H4,magicboo2u,5,Once you start watching these shows you get hooked-fast! Action and realistic too-love them-have watched all of these and hope there will be more.
B00APE00H4,Marrette Chambers "mchambers",5,I just can't get enough of Raylyn and his adventures.  Seasons 2 and 3 got me thru the cold weather now I'm up at night watching Season 4.  The twists and turns with new people and new stories tied to familiar characters just keeps me wanting to know &#34;what is going to happen next.&#34;  This is great entertainment and is better than the last season.
B00APE00H4,mayzey "d.littin",5,I was forced to watch &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; and &#34;Rawhide&#34; every week as a child. I hated it. I did not think I would voluntarily watch a tv western. This is not a 50's western. It has all the kitsch of the 50's with the topics of today. Timothy Olyphant  is a primo Sheriff.He has personality plus. All the characters are interesting misfits. I watched the first 3 season one after the other. I am doling outSeason 4. Unusually well written and entertaining in every way.
B00APE00H4,M. B. Feeser,5,I have watched this good show. The DVDs arrive in good condition. Can't wait for the next season to start.
B00APE00H4,M. Blackledge "Everyday user",4,Not as good as the early seasons but still one of my favorites.  Probably don't have much life left in the series but Timothy Olyphant and the crew make the show anyhow!  Story line is weak to some extent.
B00APE00H4,mlstillman,5,What an amazing show. Raylan is the best bad Marshall you can't help but to love.  Boyd and Raylan chemistry is amazing
B00APE00H4,Nan,5,I love this series and hope that it will continue. Great it a series that keeps you on your toes.
B00APE00H4,NLJ,5,My husband says he likes this more than Breaking Bad...I think it's just because it's over now and was tainted by the end. But we watch this together and really do like it a lot.
B00APE00H4,Octopusrex,4,I very much like the characters and plots. True to the late Elmore Leonard's writing and subtle twists in plot lines.
B00APE00H4,Oldsoldier22 "Chief3lw",4,I liked Justified since season one so four was basically more of the same. I'm not a hick from the back woods of anywhere and I don't care for &#34;duck dynasty&#34; but this a good viewing. My only negative is the producers are making the main character seem stupid when it comes to the relationship with the ex. Real men are kind of dumb when it comes to women and their emotions but eventually we get it so dumbing Raylin down takes away from his character in my opinion of course.
B00APE00H4,O. Mallard,5,Loved this season just as much as seasons 1 through 3. I'm sure the current season is just as exciting. Now to catch up on the cutrent season. Love Amazon Prime. Hope I never run out of interesting programs and movies to watch. And also love all the other benefits of PRIME. It's the ultimate deal. Love Amazon.
B00APE00H4,Pamala Pickard,4,I did not like the profane language.  This season was just as seductive as the episodes from the other seasons.
B00APE00H4,pam gee,5,i stumbled upon this tv series. i enjoyed the very first episode and every one there after. i can hardly wait to see season 5 on amazon prime for free as a member i highly recommend this show
B00APE00H4,P. B. Terry,4,Season 4 has a mystery (the long plot). Strong character driven drama by FX. Can't wait for season 5. Enjoy.
B00APE00H4,Phyllis DeSio,5,Justified Season 4 was just awesome.. we watched continued until we were finish with the season - Can't wait until we see Season 5..
B00APE00H4,Rachelle S.,5,Justified is one of the best Series that I've watched.  Every Episode and Season is GREAT!  I just wish that Justified Season 5 would become one of the Amazon Prime collections!  Maybe soon!
B00APE00H4,rathdean,3,goes to show you how protecting someone can get them or you in trouble anyway. Did not see this end coming
B00APE00H4,Raymond J. Brunner,4,I love to watch this show. It has good actors and a natural style plot. My wife even likes to watch this show with me.
B00APE00H4,Rebecca McCord,5,I love this series!! Acting is excellent and you will get so connected to the people .I look forward to next season!
B00APE00H4,Rene L. Hogan "R.L.Hogan",5,This one series is very entertaining. Each week brings something different. I am waiting for the release of the Season 5 series.
B00APE00H4,Robert D. Richter,3,The first 2 seasons were interesting but then it is like they just had a show to put on and wanted to use the same characters somewhere. Even the actors seemed to have lost interest.
B00APE00H4,Rob Lynn,5,An easy Five Star rating for excellent T.V. viewing. This program is sort of a mix of modern and a touch of old western type justice being dealt out to the bad guys by a bad (a_ _ ) guy himself. Fun to watch. Recommend to all viewers who enjoy good vs. bad type entertainment.
B00APE00H4,Ruth Grady,5,We like the series and want to continue to add Seasons from this series until it officially ends which I hope is never.
B00APE00H4,Sally Goodin,5,This series is one of my all time favorites.  It has never sagged in its momentum.  I will be so down when the series ends.
B00APE00H4,Sam P. Morgan Jr.,5,Drama with a comedic edge.  I didn't understand all that I saw but it was entertaining.  I would be watching Season 5 except Amazon now wants to charge for each show and I feel I am already paying enough.
B00APE00H4,Scotty,5,In this show Timothy olyphant shows how we were raised in the south to take of our own business. This show isn't for the kids and it has a little of everything. For the man or woman. Must see
B00APE00H4,Sewpippy "I love to read both fiction and non...,5,A great show - but not for the weak of heart! I like all the actors and the story keeps twisting and turning!
B00APE00H4,S. McDonald,4,This is a show that  makes you think. This show also reminds us that just cause ' you have a accent....  doesn't mean  you are dumb!!!
B00APE00H4,snowdogozzie,5,Who wouldn't love this show! Timothy Olyphant is a total hottie! He really brings it to his character and he has the best people to work with in my opinion! The entire Cast is great!
B00APE00H4,Steve P,4,Ongoing good storylines and strong characters keep me coming back for more. Very happy that I can get them on my Kindle Fire
B00APE00H4,Sunni,5,I thoroughly enjoyed Justified 4. All the acting is appropriate for the area and those with small parts were superb. Of course Timothy is my favorite. Too bad I have to pay for Season 5. Not in my budget. Amazon thanks for some outstanding tv series.
B00APE00H4,Susan Crow,5,I love every issue of this show from Season 1 through Season 4.  I like everything about it and am waiting for Season 5.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of show.
B00APE00H4,swizzlestick "Swizz",5,Enjoyed the entire Drew Thompson story line. Very much enjoyed seeing more of Jacob Pitts. The relationship between Boyd and Raylen as dynamic as ever.
B00APE00H4,Ted Robbins,4,I've never been to Harlan County nor to Kentucky for that matter but when this show comes on I am reminded somehow of the culture and geographical area about which this series is written. The production company and cast members manage to invoke the atmospherics that are generated from particular areas and even though I know it's filmed in California it still manages to transport me to Harlan County. I have finished season #4 and  will stream  season #5  as soon as it's released. Keep it up FX. Please don't cancel.
B00APE00H4,Tiffany Ann Conroy Moore "TACM",5,My husband and I are huge fans of this show. Best to begin at Season 1 so you get the whole trajectory.
B00APE00H4,T. J. Foster,5,I've always liked Mr. Olyphant. The character he plays in this show is the perfect mix of a-hole and gentleman. Its a fun show to watch!
B00APE00H4,Uncle B,4,I'm from Kentucky so I'm very familiar with the Bluegrass Conspiracy story element they wove into the plot this season.Loved it!!
B00APE00H4,Value Shopper Pensacola,5,I began watching this series when Amazon made the first three seasons available on Amazon Prime.  I really have enjoyed watching season 4 and hope that you will eventually add season 5.  Thank you.
B00APE00H4,Vicki Fleming,5,It is a real shame this well written and acted series is not going to continue after season five.  An adult show that doesn't insult your intelligence.
B00APE00H4,webbsb,5,I love love love this show! Seasons 3 and 4 are a little dark but very entertaining! I highly recommend this show!
B00APE00H4,William E. Rice,3,I liked the other 3 seasons better. This season seemed to have little cohesion for me. I still liked it but not like the others.
B00APE00H4,William R. Kolbe,5,I can't wait until season 5 is available.  Rayland and Boyd are both fascinating characters and their relationship subtly changes with each subsequent season.
B00APE00ZG,GeoUtah,5,This series is brilliant. I'm cheap. I don't pay $2 bucks an episode for just anything. This was well worth it. Mischievous and entertaining in reclaiming her life as it ends.
B00APE06UA,Amazon Customer "Hooked",5,This was a great show. Too bad it was taken off the air. I could have watched more and will miss it.
B00APE06UA,Niki,5,I started watching deception and kept buying the episodes. I cant get enough of it. It has a great plot. I am trying to catch up to it on t.v.. I hope they keep it going for a long time.
B00APN5JQW,Amazon Customer "My Opinion's for your review...,4,It was soothing to watch but it did not feel like I was looking at an aquarium. Still I use it as white noise back ground.
B00APN5JQW,Jayebee,2,This is a live aquarium with real fish and loud bubbling noise.  Nothing wrong with watching fish live but they tend to be shy and inactive.  I'll have to admit that if I want an aquarium on my computer or TV screen I would rather have the animated variety - it's much more interesting.
B00APN5JQW,LibraryFriends,3,It's a twist on the tv fireplace thing and strangely fascinating.  Very cute idea!  Six more words required to end.
B00APN5JQW,Ms. Annette Arnold "nucie 50",5,I like listening to it when I am relaxing and reading a book. Also it just nice to look at when kicking back and relaxing and clearing your mind. It a nice aquarium without the fuss.
B00APN5JQW,White Raven "zxy",4,This video should have bee rated R17 for explicit content.  These fish are totally nude!  They remain that way thru the whole film.  The film maker did not even have the decency to put pants on these smut peddling smelt!  Hard to believe that this is recommended for families.
B00APPB766,Adrianne M. Callahan "3kmom",5,Great show! GIRLS ARE VERY TALENTED AND THEIR PARENTS PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT IN SPITE OF ABBY
B00APPB766,Brenda Walls,4,Fun silly and mindless entertainment. The kids are awesome dancers and Abby actually blows me away by her creative mind...totally a great series that keeps you entertained!
B00APPB766,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,Hilarious show. I watch it also because the dances are awesome. Abbey is a hoot. Even thought a little mean at time.
B00APPB766,Kimberly Micohn "Kim Micohn",2,Why isn't the episode from last night not here yet? I have been noticing it more and more that the tv shows that you buy from here are starting to take longer and longer to get:(
B00APPB766,LisserpieFamily,4,I hate the constant fighting between moms & Abby & Christie always crying .( grow up Christie )But my kids remind me that the show is called &#34; &#34;Dance moms&#34; for a reason -- I like the girls dancing: beautiful & entertaining
B00APPB766,Mark Hall,5,Started watching Dance Moms back during Season 1. We still get it now for my daughter. I loved watching the show but I am worn out from all the fighting and bickering going o in front of the kids. Getting a little too same story differ episode. Now I just scan through the show to the actual dance clips...
B00APPB766,swr4pink "swr4pink",5,I didn't watch this show until I saw Season 1&2 on Prime.  I have since bought 3&4.  Don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
B00APRBBBK,aztnge,5,I really kinda like this show & Rachel Nichols is very good as a cop accidentally sent back from the future along with some major bad criminals. She has just the right mixture of being hot & sexy & yet being a girl that can really kick butt.
B00APRBBBK,Danar "Ardent Booky",4,The Continuum television show is a great new concept. Her all in one suit is a really neat idea and I would hope that will be in the future of police officers everywhere. And the shot that she gives criminals that will insure that they will go turn themselves in or face unbearable pain is genius.My husband and I both love this new series.
B00APRBBBK,D. Ernstzen "DE",5,Since the loss of Stargate universe I have been waiting for a good series with a decent plot. This does show promise and I am looking forward to the coming episodes. I missed it when it was first released so I am rating it based on what I have seen so far. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did .
B00APRBBBK,Diane S,5,I love time travel themes.  They did a good job with this one.  Can't wait for the next season to come put.
B00APRBBBK,Gerard M. Walsh "book_rod",5,Call me a Sci Fi nut. I like this show and I enjoy being able to take it with me where I go.
B00APRBBBK,Grill Sgt,5,Not what I expected.  Much better than I had hoped.  Good acting and good story line.  Can't wait for season 2.
B00APRBBBK,Jacqueline Garrett "jackie g",5,I watched a show quite by accident and liked it very much.  I certainly hope there is a season 2.
B00APRBBBK,Jacry1990,3,not as good and moving as I like for a show. Need more in it for me. Slow in many places
B00APRBBBK,Joy "JTS",5,Enjoy that this show is both a 'cop' show AND Sy-Fy.  Interesting mix of the two genres.  Female lead is excellent.  Enjoy the story immensely.  Male lead is a poor choice but the rest of the show makes up for it.
B00APRBBBK,JV,5,I love futurist type series and movies and I am enjoying this one keep up the good work and am looking forward to more shows this season and upcoming seasons. When are the new series on continuum coming out I can't wait to see more of this season 1 and of future season  to come loving it.
B00APRBBBK,Lois,5,Having a new sci fi series is great and this is one of the good ones....  Like the actress and she comes across with the story line well to...
B00APRBBBK,Mpr90,5,Really good show with an interesting plot line. Definitely applies to what I am interested. Any Sci Fi theme I am hooked. Cannot wait for season 2!
B00APRBBBK,Retired in Hawaii,5,Great movie and so interesting..  I will be sure to purchase the other seasons when they are released hopefully soon.
B00APRBBBK,Slack,5,They leave you on the edge of your seat all the way through the show! I hope that this show has many more season!
B00APRBBBK,tyelmene "tyelmene",5,This is a surprisingly well acted and very well written series with an absolutely fantastic basic plot line.  Very highly recommended!
B00APRBBBK,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,3,It was a good series and if it continued after the second season I probably would have given it five stars.  I think the writers painted themselves into a corner where they had to stop less they look like complete idiots.
B00APUQK7C,Paul Jonathan Wells,5,Absoultely Amazing and I could not believe that the quality and experience was so enjoyable.  Definitely recommend to other buyers!!!!
B00APUQK7C,Wendy Pullins,5,This show was hilarious! I loved the very end of season 1! Looking forward to season 2 and more surprises!
B00APUQLYO,Dean Corso,1,NO rating. Never got to see the preview. Tried to watch it but the Amazon system wouldn't make it happen. After a few tries I just gave up and got it elsewhere.
B00APUQLYO,Dennis "barbarosa",3,Seen this many times before with different actors playing the same old role. Neesom is always good though and his presence alone made it worth watching.
B00APUQLYO,Holly,4,I really liked the first Taken movie and wanted to see what the second movie looked like. Preview looks awesome!
B00APUQLYO,Judy B,2,This is one of my few negative comments because Taken 2 has been out long enough that it should be offered for streaming with prime. This extended preview was a mistake. I thought it was the real show disappointing.
B00AQAEF7S,Amazon Customer "Nina",1,Just watching ticket writers got boring. My favorite part was the impound lot and when that was gone it lost its humor.
B00AQAEF7S,Blanda Lynam,4,Not quite sure why I like this show but I do.  It is interesting to see how people try to get out of tickets and the towing lot is my favorite.  There were several people that did not even remember where they parked their car because of partying just a little too much.My complaint it that only season 4 and 5 are free.  I don't want to pay to see the shows and don't understand why what was free are not being charged.  Like House Hunters.
B00AQAEF7S,Brandon R,4,It's hilarious how people react and show off for something minor and ridiculous how peoples tickets added up to months of bills.
B00AQAEF7S,Joseph J Mallory,3,Its okay just to kill time when you don't have anything and I mean anything to fill your time. Not very intertaining.
B00AQAEF7S,Roy A Nelson Jr.,3,I like the Parking Wars series but the amazon video is just not as high quality as what I watch on Netflix.
B00AQAEF7S,S. CONRAD,5,Very good. Can't go wrong watching this. I recommand this to everyone. I love parking wars because it's different.
B00ARAN1SG,Lurch,5,These are a wonderful way to see what modern really means a great collection and very educational.  You will not go wrong watching and learning
B00ARAO6SU,Eric W. Hutcheson "guyseattle",4,Modern Marvels is a fascinating look at things from all areas of life that will both entertain and educate all ages.
B00ARAO6SU,Sabrina Powder Puff "Sabrina",5,It's just a an interesting show. How are things made? How did that happen? Why does this announcer have such a cool voice? Can I get him to be the announcer on my voicemail?I love Modern Marvels because it's not a fluffy show and it makes me smarter. MODERN MARVELS! Best thing on the History Channel.
B00ASM0RL2,drummer593,5,This is the last of a three season sitcom! These girls don't freakin play they will punch you like a man baby! Everyone should have this in your collection!
B00ASM0RL2,Harlan Kamm,1,I'm suprised they would make a series like this.  A person would need to be very bored to make it through even one of these.
B00ASM0RL2,PDJ,5,I love this show so much I watch it all the time since it began and it is great and you should watch it too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ASM0RL2,Tanesha L. Barkley,5,These women are victims of the lifestyle they were born into and they are trying find a way to become normal everyday people. They had to accept things they were told and yes they had to endure the backlashing they receive from the public. Pray for them for their lifes to be turned around without all the drama and danger. They r funny TB
B00ASM0RL2,WritingIrish "LM Killian",5,it reminds me of a friend's house whereeveryone came to party and over the years the drama stirred itself up and everyone seemed 2 faced.  People either grow together or apart.  It's a great watch...but it also makes me sad.
B00ATF4P8O,B. Edmondson,5,The struggles are even worse this year it seems for everyone.  I truly don't know how these people keep coming back sometimes when it seems to take everything they have to turn a dime by seasons end.
B00ATF4P8O,Irving DeStiller,3,I find it impossible to believe that Bering Sea Gold has ended for the season .Have they just taken a mid season break ?
B00ATLJYL6,Amanda C.,1,So much to say and I tried to be fair but I turned it off about 1/3 of the way through.
B00ATLJYL6,Amazon Customer,4,Tripped out movie. Would watch it again. The streaming was a little sketchy though. It kept stopped streaming several times.
B00ATLJYL6,Ekay,3,Interesting plot about alternate universes. A little too weird for my taste but well produced and acted with great special effects.
B00ATLJYL6,Janice E. Garver,3,This is pretty funny. Didn't mind watching it and found several parts amuzing. Actors were very good in their roles and carried the content of this movie to its max.
B00ATLJYL6,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Funky. Movie that is an overveiw in a way of drug addiction. Or is a comedy about Multics dimensions.  Or is sort of Scary.  This movie is so many things you just never know what will happen next.once you watch it you will find yourself recommending this movie to everyone you know.Watch it you will enjoy and it is lime chips you cannot watch just once.
B00ATLJYL6,Lynn McBee,5,This movie is definitely for people that enjoy the odd and weird. I loved the book and was pleasantly surprised by how well the movie reflected the book. I really didn't think it could be translated into film. This movie should be reviewed by parents as it has quite a few references to recreational drugs.
B00AV605D0,Bandit,5,I LOVE CALL of the midwife. This started out slow and i wasn't so sure it was going to be as good as the season... but it was terrific and more than met my expectations. Beautifully done.  Great actors and wonderful heartwarming but realistic stories.
B00AV605D0,Deanna Alpert,5,-- but I constantly fall in love with these newborn babies delivered safely by the hands of these competent and loveable midwives.  I hope there is another season to enjoy.
B00AV605D0,Lori Cullember "kupuanani",5,I absolutely love this series.  I watch it all the time.  Ladies in this outstanding series are refreshing and fun loving...all of them.
B00AV605D0,Ponytail Pam,5,This is one of the best BBC shows I've seen in a long time. It is simply captivating. I love it!!!
B00AVTLUD6,Amazon Customer "Mermu",4,This is one of the few shows for me that I would consider a must watch. Timothy Olyphant is a great actor regardless but his portrayal of Raylan Givens is a classic.
B00AVTLUD6,beekeeper "and stings to prove it",5,Just finished a marathon this week of Season 4 via Amazon and was sad that it only had 13 episodes. If there were more TV shows like this one I would subscribe to satellite again!The end of episode 13 with that haunting song "You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive" was awesome. I can't wait for Season 5.
B00AVTLUD6,D. G. Porter "&#34;Utter Contempt&#34;",5,Just can't beat Marshal Givens. Last season coming up but they should add about 10 more. Love the storylines.
B00AVTLUD6,diannerae,5,I look forward to season five next year. In the mean time I will watch all the 4 seasons I currently have along with the movies I have and may get more.
B00AVTLUD6,icewoman63,5,timothy Olyphant O.M.G.  he's by far the best man for Raylin he makes this show what it is thanks guys don't quit writing
B00AVTLUD6,J. N. McCarthy,4,Good series with inner-twining story lines. Timothy Olyphant does a good job playing backwoods marshal who knows the ins and outs of the Kentucky hollers.  Enjoyable to watch and good character actors that do a great job in keeping the episodes interesting.
B00AVTLUD6,MacGyver's "Swiss Army Knife",5,one of the best shows on TV.  Makes me want to drink beer and eat meat.  Carry on Marshal Givens
B00AVTLUD6,Mazie101,5,Excellent!!!  Excellent cast and story line and goes very smoothly and is complete with many different characters.The location is just the right touch and enhances the show as you watch.  The twist and turns add to this.
B00AVTLUD6,R. A. Macgaren,5,I am enjoying this season tremendously and will look forward to watching it again and again.  This is a great television series.
B00AVTLUD6,Sr Happy Popi "Mr. Stacy J.",5,This here is the best neo-noir hard-boiled postbellum/western detective show ever conceived and produced ... and (almost all) the girls are real purdy too.  I'm proud to have watched every episode.
B00AVTLVY4,eric,2,I used to really like Dual Survival but the new season with Joe Teti SUCKS.He maybe a great special ops man but Stinks at this just way to arrogant. mikyle Hawks would have been a better pick. Or better yet whatever the controversy is with Dave Canterbury(and yes we've all heard big deal) could have been overcome like the whole Bear Grills thing if someone at discovery hadn't freaked. AS is show is not worth watching anymore let alone buy.whole show is headed toward oblivion if discovery doesn't do something fast.And that would be a sad loss.
B00AVTLVY4,Kungfujackrabbit,4,I still follow Dave and im not bothered one way or another from the change in cast. The show is interesting and well made. Keep making it and we will keep watching it!
B00AVXYXRM,Alicia Yates,5,Love it he is freaking hilarious!! Love publizity it's one of my fav sketches!! O & dr armond is good too
B00AVXYXRM,B. S. Diederich "trashartist",1,I made it though 12 minutes and couldn't take the annoying 'whine' which was supposed to be 'comical' I suppose. Cliche drivel. Nothing clever--a guy in make-up. a man with a bad gay act. commercial spots half-heartedly thrown in randomly. I am not sure who would find this funny--I think middle-school kids have more sense and tact and a more complex sense of humor. The world needs to back off this type of junk and feed off something with intelligence and maturity.
B00AVXYXRM,Michael,5,This show is free king hilarious! Kroll is a comic genius. Fresh at first but some of the characters do get a bit played out.
B00AWM9RX2,Brenda Santiago,4,its amazing to see how they prep for photo shoots... it was entertaining in that sense... but the cruelty of needing to look a certain way... was a bit sad...
B00AWM9RX2,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",3,These ladies aren't . . . ladies that is.  Their ignorance is staggering but nevertheless it's amusing if you can tolerate people who live in their mirrors.
B00AWM9RX2,sao,2,The show itself I would give a 2-3 stars for content. I guess it is just not my thing so much drama but it is a reality show so what do you think you are going to get. My problem is the video always skips or freezes. I got so sick of it I had to turn it off. It was not my internet conection of TV it is the show I have tried it a few other places and had the same issue.
B00AWMR6DA,Francisco Loaiza,1,Couldn't even watch the whole episode.  I'd rather see young adults behaving with a higher moral code. Not worth watching.
B00AWMR6DA,K. R. Merryman,3,Wild teens with little discipline or common sence.
B00AWMR6DA,Kuhn Rich,3,kids having a country wild time . broke loud drunk and obnoxiousfun when your young but glad they are in west virginia
B00AWMR6DA,S. S. "Super",2,Jr high setting.  Entertaining in a weird way but too juvinile to watch a whole series.  Reminiscent of 80s movies
B00AX4QEAS,Adam,5,Eye opener to some simple facts that we tend to disregard. If you ever wonder why you can't lose weight and do everything you can this will tell you why.
B00AX4QEAS,Tony,1,It was not as good as I hoped.  It really boiled down to ...don't eat processed food.  I fell asleep twice.
B00AYALPLO,BARBARA RICOTTA,5,HOPE THEY KEEP THE PARENTS IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.  NO CHEATING.. FOR THEM..LOVE ALL OF THEM. GREAT JOB THANK YOU
B00AYALPLO,Wendy Pullins,5,I love the plots and the actors. I hope it continues into the teens college days. Would love to see a book about this show.
B00AYRIFH4,A Everett,5,I thorough enjoy the scientific subjects presented in this PBS programming.  Worth every penny!  I recommend this programming to all.
B00AYRIFH4,AREVIEW,5,Lots of great episodes in this volume! Quality of content is up to par as usual with this excellent series. Always up-to-date and accurate and never sensationalized or biased.
B00AYRIFH4,M. KochKetola "Otaku",4,Nova is a wonderful show and this is another Very good season although no exactly one of the best seasons.
B00AYRIFH4,Terry Draper,5,I guess any PBS-NOVA program will be 5 stars to someone.  I don't even remember the name of the program Amazon is referring to.
B00AYT159C,Codie Schlotterbeck,5,This show keeps you guessing. You can definitely tell that the same author that wrote pretty little liars wrote the lying game. Two phenomenal shows!
B00AYT159C,Elizabeth Bailey,5,Intriguing story line.  Kept my attention and found the cliffhangers to be well placed.  Would watch more of this series.
B00AYT159C,Karen Robinson "Ivy",4,Every episode just makes you want to see more! I wish the episodes were released ahead of time for people who don't want to wait like me
B00AYT159C,Niki,5,I really enjoyed the Lying game. I looked for season 2 and searched if it would return. Made me mad to think it wouldn't be coming back. It was worth watching. I just want it to come back.
B00AYT159C,Rating My Best Pick,5,I love the lying game each episode had a suprise revealed. I missed the 5th season I think where her step sister is suppose to help the other twin investigate.
B00AYT159C,Valerie Tucker,5,I loved watching it on my iPad while working out.  I wish it had not ended.  I will probably watch it again after a while.  Very intriguing and fun!
B00AYU5ULA,Aimee,5,I LOVE everything about this show!  Cant wait for season 4!  Time to get your wine on!  yeh yeh yeh
B00AYU5ULA,Codie Schlotterbeck,5,This show is hilarious! It is not politically correct and sometimes crude but that is what makes it such a great show!!
B00AYUCDDS,ClearBucket,5,This has been a great show so far. I tried watching the British version and found it a little boring. I say give this a try from the start of the series.
B00AYUCDDS,colleen,5,I have become so addicted to this show that I wait till all the episodes have played before I start watching.  That way I can have a marathon and watch episode after episode and never have to wait till next week!
B00AYUCDDS,dap123,4,Supernatural beings in a struggle to hang on to their humanity and live normal lives. Their struggles are anything but normal. Highly entertaining and often comical.
B00AYUCDDS,David Swayne,5,The first episode is almost better and more suspenseful than a season finale. There are some totally surprising twists and turns. This is one of my favorite shows ever!
B00AYUCDDS,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,This is the American version of a British show but I have watched it since Season 1 and it took me a few episodes to get into it (and I think the writers got better) and now it is a guilty pleasure I watch religiously.  Great stuff.
B00AYUCDDS,Jeff Riley,4,I love the action and personal storys. It has a mix of both personal drama and interesting si fi stories. Never a dull moment.
B00AYUCDDS,KMaggi3,5,Being Human is an excellent show.  This season has been particulary enjoyable.  I love the comical conversations between Aiden and Sally.  It's well written and the actors are great.  The chemistry between these 4 actors is palpable.  Season 3 is the best season so far!
B00AYUCDDS,Lawman,5,Started watching this because I was bored one night and thought I would give it a shot.  Now I am addicted to the show.  I have never seen the other version but this version rocks great actors with great plots.
B00AYUCDDS,Marlena,5,This show really plays on your heart strings.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this season and hope there will be more to come in the future.
B00AYUCDDS,melvin watkins,4,have always enjoyed this program lots of juicey going ons to keep you guessing will continue to eat my fill with each episode
B00AYUCDDS,Patricia Appelquist,4,I am not familiar with the UK version but they must have changed head writers because the character archs are shifting from whom has the guilt trip and WHY Can't JOSH grow a PAIR! UGH
B00AYUCDDS,Patricia M. Brown,4,I have liked Being human since the first season because it shows both sides of each character. It depicts both the monster side and the vulnerable side of all of them.
B00AYUCDDS,Runs with Scissors,4,Developing characters this season and repercussion of decisions made is seen this season.  It is not following the same script as the British version which is welcome to see.
B00AZRLEVW,L,5,The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is a fantastic poke-fun and point out the absurdity of our political system and the people who are such an easy target because they do not live in the same world the rest of us do.
B00AZRLEVW,Stanley Fernandes,5,Stewart is very funny.  His facial expressions and delivery make the show.  Very good writing.  Highly recommended if you like laughing at both sides of the political spectrum.  Stewart makes fun of both conservative and liberal idiocy.
B00AZRLEVW,Theresa Inziello "Tracy2.0",4,We find the Jon Stewart show very well done and always topical. We especially like the movie reviews. Thanks for asking.
B00B09HOGI,Bevvie,5,This gets five stars cause my great-granddaughter who is three and always talks non-stop.  Did not have one word to say thought the whole show... Now that's saying something.  ....
B00B09HOGI,Kindle MomLKS,5,My 4 year old daughter loved this episode of Sophia the First. She was thoroughly entertained during the entire episode.
B00B09HOGI,lLily,5,This movie made my daughter feel like a princess and made ME her servant for 1 week it was kind of annoying.
B00B09HOGI,Rubydoo67,5,mY 3 yo loves the program and Sofia is a favorite.  Graphics are good and my daughter watches all the time
B00B0FDEMU,Geneva,5,funniest man in America! he has the best way to get a point across AND be funny at the same time.
B00B0FDEMU,Stanley Fernandes,5,5 stars!  Colbert is very funny once you realize that he is being sarcastic and just having fun with the political right wingers and fox news.  Take it for what it is... a comedy show.
B00B0K9PKU,singer "mg",5,Ever look inside of a magazine and wonder what it must be like to be a contemporary celebrity and live a normal life? Well this explores this question and more. Much more. I  must say watching this did change my behaviour. I'm not one to often buy a celebrity magazine but I have done so and after watching this I will never buy one again. Its up to all of us as consumers to decide what kind of world we want to live in.
B00B0TNVNS,Barbara A. Kephart,3,I haven't watched any of the seasons because the singers just aren't good enough to hold my interest.  I really like Debra Messing though.  I hope to see her in other gigs.
B00B0TNVNS,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",5,I like season two more than one.  I love season one so was excited when season two was even better.
B00B0TNVNS,Dwight,2,omigod - I don't know if it is the lead actress's waxy skin or her waxy acting but she always looks like she is eager to be a hooker or something despite being an instant farm girl or whatever her clean as a whistle background is supposed to be.  I did enjoy Ivy's veteran nervousness but this is altogether a very creepy show EXPERTLY acted.  I don't understand the point of this show at all.  I thought at first it would be a launchpad for an actual Broadway show that would have guaranteed sales from fans of the show but I really doubt it now.  It's just a terrible and expensive embarassing show.  If only it was fun to watch in its awfulness.
B00B0TNVNS,harleygal,1,Last season this show started out phenomenal. This season I'm still trying to figure out what happened. The storyline has gotten so goofy I'm not sure if it's going to survive another season. Bring back the original writers and get the show back on track
B00B0TNVNS,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,AWESOME STORY AND VERY VERSATILE ACTORS.  COULDN'T STOP WATCHING IT.  THE SINGING WAS FABULOUS .  MS. HUSTON WAS AGAIN AT HER BEST.  I REALLY WISH THERE WAS MORE TO WATCH.  LET ME KNOW WHEN ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS COMES ALONG.
B00B0TNVNS,Kindle Customer "Amazon Devotee",5,This was a great show. Clearly not all agreed as it wasn't renewed for the 2013/2014 season. Perhaps the audience is limited. We love live theater and have two kids who perform locally. We found found a lot to relate to and loved the &#34;insider&#34; backstage view.
B00B0TNVNS,nurse_judith,4,I didn't think I'd like this series at first but then it all came together by series 2.  There sure are some very talented dancers and singers.  Some of the squabbles between the producers and writer's became redundant but may be that's how a Broadway show gets put on Broadway.  The starlett &#34;Ivy&#34; was a masterpiece as a Marilyn Monroe clone.
B00B0TNVNS,Paul Jonathan Wells,5,This is all I can say about amazon instant video.  I can't get enough of it.  Instantly I am satisfied and able to enjoy all my favorite shows and movies for cheap.
B00B0TNVNS,rebma,5,Wonderful show and amazing characters. So terribly sad it was not renewed for another season. I looked forward to it each week.
B00B0TNVNS,Renee L Williams,5,There were so many talented people in this series.  The artists had phenomenal voices!  I especially loved Katharine McPhee's enchanting voice.  Angelica Houston and Bernadette Peters are still beautiful ladies that still have it.  I really enjoyed Christian Borle's sense of humor.  All of the characters were terrific.  I am hoping they'll produce Smash Season 3.
B00B0TNVNS,SoCal Mom,5,Too bad this was cancelled.. it makes a great DVD as a pair with season 1.. maybe better as a whole story like this than episodic tv.. so do not miss the chance to see it ...
B00B0TNVNS,tomtom,3,The first season was good with back-stabbing and driven people. Second season seems like they are going through the motions. The cast additions are not good.
B00B0TNVNS,toni gulotta,5,loved the second part of the series.  wish there was a series III  and iv.  music was great.  all the stars did a fantastic job.
B00B0TNY3K,Debbie Dillon,5,Season 11 and I still like it. I didn't watch the first couple of seasons but I would like to watch it. Looking forward to Season 12.
B00B0TNY3K,passionatereader,5,I've been watching Project Runway since it began and I still love it more than anything I watch.Season 11 was more fun because it was &#34;teams&#34; and so there was more interaction between designers and more communitythan ever on the long-running show.I really love Heidi and Nina and felt Zac Posen was a good change from Michael Kors.  Lots of interesting star judges too.Love to actually see the designers working and love the judging.
B00B0TNY3K,S. Belcher "Tadpole998",5,Different having this season as a &#34;team&#34; sport so to speak; I've watched every season andknow the contestants despise the &#34;team&#34; efforts.  Love Tim Gunn....
B00B0TO5DS,Andrew Baker,5,Wow! This is one of the best series ever created! The acting is amazing. The theme is highly creative. The story lines are ingenious!
B00B0TO5DS,B. Merrill,5,You really never know what Jason's ultra ego will do while he is asleep. There have only been a few shows but so far its pretty entertaining. He is good Dr. by day and party animal at night. The two ego's are always running in a collision course.
B00B0TO5DS,CW FISHER "stars for connie",4,This is going to be a great series and the actors is excellent and also the writing.  The actors are very good and you see the medical side of the story which is heart warming.  Please take a look at this show.
B00B13UW0I,Doug R. Troupe "drt568",4,Very good information. Lots of open questions still about the meaning of Organic. Recommended to people interested in meaning of Organic and how people perceive the meaning.Doug
B00B13UW0I,magikhanz,5,Skeptical at first then as the documentary went along we found it to be a fair and accurate account of what is really going on in this country
B00B13UW0I,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",3,I learned something watching this video.  I didn't know that products can be organic and still be sprayed with pesticides.  Actually didn't know there were pesticides that qualify for organic use.  Made me realize - again - that despite being organic produce needs to be thoroughly washed before using.
B00B13UW0I,Varian David,4,Great documentary that confirms a number if things I feel about "organic" products. This is definitely a must see. Well balanced and informative.
B00B19DDOY,D. Brennan,5,Bourdain's shows are the best foodie/travel shows going. A Cook's Tour continues his reign as the cook most likely to offend and yet get welcomed warmly into the best spots.
B00B19DDOY,Happy Flamingo,5,WE REALLY ENJOY HIS EXPLAINING OF WHAT HE IS DOING AND WHO HE IS WITH THAT REALLY HOLDS OUR ATTENTION. HE HAS SUCH A WAY WITH WORDS AND IS WILLING TO EXPOSE WHO HE IS TO THE PUBLIC.I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY OF THE SHOWS AND BOOKS HE IS INVOLVED IN. I THINK HE PRETENDS TO BE A BAD BOY BUT HE IS REALLY A SOFTY. HE JUST HAS TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES.
B00B19DDOY,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",4,It appears that from an early point in his career Bourdain delighted in food oddities.  Several of the episodes in season one highlight this predilection.  The series is entertaining if occasionally gross for a less adventurous eater.  This is a preview of the largely European fad for tarting up the nasty bits and charging high prices.  I'm ready for less of that.  Still Bourdain is excels at amiable chat and seems genuine in his appreciation for the foods of other cultures.
B00B19DSFS,Jeanie M Nord,2,So we need another movie like this?  The only reason I rented it was because others had given such good reviews.
B00B19DSFS,KES,4,I enjoyed this take on the last days of Marie Antoinette Lea Seydoux and Diane Kruger make it well worth watching along with the great art direction and gritty grubby realism of revolution
B00B19GYCW,A. Joseph Orlando,5,This is where we are folks. The drug war is major waste and a slow moving holocaust targeting the poor and disenfranchised. The Obama administration needs to see this. Hell everyone needs to see this.
B00B19GYCW,Craig Neading,4,It was a very informative movie and opened my eyes about the drug problem in this country. I would watch it again.
B00B1NI9TY,Steven Epley,4,I admit I checked this one out without any high expectations. The cast is mostly unknown to me and the story seemed a little odd. I was pleasantly surprised that the cast was actually pretty effective and the story held together and I am a fan of dark humor which runs all through this movie. It is rather graphic in parts so be warned but if you are looking for a rental worth a view as a popcorn movie then I recommend this one for your  consideration.
B00B1OZGHG,Basketville,5,Love watching the creativity in this season. I always enjoy watching people who are really skilled at their crafts. Face off is a unique chance to see behind the movie industry .
B00B1OZGHG,Nicole Crew "Trauma Queen",5,This show has inspired me so much to start creating things they make. If you love special effects and like seeing the real thing not CGI you MUST watch this show!
B00B23TA28,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",5,I have been a die hard fan since its conception.  Very few times have I been let down other than by the occasional antics of Steve and Tango.  Worth every penny to me.
B00B23TA28,Debra Cook,5,This show is great.  Each case has it's own interesting beginning to end.  I hope I can get season 10 now as well.
B00B23TA28,R. M "movier",5,I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am still hooked.
B00B2EX4C4,dhar238,5,Awesome show with some of the best evidence I've seen to date. Very happy season 2 will be airing! Can't wait to see what they find when they re-open that mine (which I am assuming they are going to do).
B00B2EX4C4,John E. Scott,5,This is truly a paranormal dream to have a place like a mine that is haunted. Its so dark you can do investigations any time day or night. Their is little electrical to cause EMF spikes so your equipment can focus on other causes for EMF spikes. What I find with Ghost mine is how the producer combines the workers of the mine into the show and how they react to all the activity. This I think makes the show more interesting and adds to the show by including their own experiences. I hope the series returns.
B00B2EX4C4,Journey "Journey",5,We really enjoyed this show! It was very interesting to hear the old miners tell their tales of being a miner. I wouldn't have guessed they were so superstitious but I now understand why. This show is a nice twist to the typical ghost shows!
B00B2EX4C4,normaporter,5,The first season I thought started a little slow but when they started seeing and hearing things in the mine it all got very interesting. I am looking forawrd to the next season.
B00B2EX4C4,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",4,The premise is really interesting - ghost hunters in an old gold mine with eccentric miners -- ghost hunters meet miners.  I do like the combination of reality mining show with reality ghost show.  Both provide interesting subject matter and unique characters.The thing that keeps me from being totally on board is that I can't tell whether any of it is for real or whether its all totally scripted and fake.  I don't mind a certain amount of scripting (a la Ghost Hunters) but the characters and scenarios in this series just make me wonder if there's any reality in this reality show.  I guess though - as it is entertaining fair it really doesn't matter too much.
B00B2EX4C4,Stinky Greg,5,This is the best show of it's type out there. My wife loves the whole ghost investigation aspect of it while I find the search for gold to be the most interesting. It has something for both of us. I especially like that the woman investigatior seems knowledable and isn't on the show just to prance around scantily dressed. I own this one and can't wait for the next season to come out.
B00B2G2RG6,A. Joseph Orlando,2,I don't know but I just found the whole concept too preposterous and superficial in its depiction of violence and suspense. It just seems like it wants to shock you because it has to compete with other cable shows that are much more successful in their execution of similar edgy material. I'm not feeling the hero or the villain in this setup. Way too contrived for my tastes.
B00B2G2RG6,B. Merrill,5,This is another one that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Great cast they work well trying to solve the plot of a cult serial killer.
B00B2G2RG6,carolwho2,5,I absolutely love this show. I like to watch it on Amazon video because there are no commercials. Also if I miss an episode I can catch up on there as well.
B00B2G2RG6,cindy gooch,4,This is a fun show to watch. It is the same kind of show as Prison Break or 24. Very suspenseful and eventful.
B00B2G2RG6,Constance,5,How can you go wrong with a series starring Kevin Bacon!The writing and acting are well done..............Agent Hardy vs. Joe Carroll.James Purefoy (honestly he looked familiar but I was not aware of him) plays the character of Joe Carroll perfectly. A seemingly brilliant professor who just happens to be a serial killer with a cult following.Glad they picked it up for another season!
B00B2G2RG6,dcbookworm "dcbookworm",2,Wish he had better writers and co-stars.
B00B2G2RG6,Dena,1,The series is beautifully produced and well-acted. But the grisly focus is creepy and offensive. It's just porn in a pretty package.
B00B2G2RG6,D. Greene "pooh",5,Heard about this show from a friend and decided to give it a try. My husband & I really like it & can't wait for season 2 to come out!
B00B2G2RG6,Donna K. Ford "English Mystery Collector",1,Lacks character depth and relies too much on shock value. For a series to be successfulit has to have more than this one provides.
B00B2G2RG6,EVE  ADAMS,5,I love it  can't  wait till  the next  season. I hope it will  come out  soon. I  give it 5 stars.
B00B2G2RG6,Felicity Springthorpe,4,Dexter without the touchy-feely angles. Liked it and especially James Purefoy. Brilliant casting. Playing against Kevin Bacon works. Even the crazy premise works.
B00B2G2RG6,Jason Nisanov,5,This show will keep you guessing from start to finish.  They could not have picked a better cast for this one.
B00B2G2RG6,Joy "JTS",5,Favorite show!  Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy give amazing performances.  It's a nail-biter every show.  The suspence is killing me- can't wait to watch the next episode.
B00B2G2RG6,Judith A. Chandler,4,Creepy creepy creepy. Love Kevin Bacon!!  What a villain how can good ever win over him?  Whoa! Sucks you in.
B00B2G2RG6,Kathryn M Guffey,5,This series is not for the faint of heart. It is very intense and unpredictable. You can't wait for the next episode.
B00B2G2RG6,Kathy A.,5,I love Kevin Bacon and loved the suspense of this show!  Had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait until the next season!
B00B2G2RG6,K. Rodman "knamdor",3,It hought I would really like this show but it is a little on the boring side.  Don't care for the plot anymore.
B00B2G2RG6,LOUISE,5,great show and suspenseful Keven Bacon is a great actor. The show keeps you in supense of what will happen next
B00B2G2RG6,michele symonette,5,the pilot caught my interest but I will need to watch a couple more episodes to see if this show continues to hold it.
B00B2G2RG6,Niki,5,i saw the first 2 shows on amazon and it was worth buying it to see what it was about. now i am following it every monday night. hope they continue the show it keeps you wondering whats going to happen next. Its great!!!
B00B2G2RG6,Pamela "pvs",4,The concept of a serial killer having groupies is totally scary for sure. Especially one who gets so much pleasure from it and thinks it is a work of art to do. Yucky! Well. I know man is evil from birth so it is no great surprise to me. I already know that it takes much more to be good at being noble than it does at being calculatingly evil. That was Lucifers way from his rebellion from God.
B00B2G2RG6,Patricia Ann,3,The show hasn't quite found it's groove yet but I hope it will be renewed for a second season.Every move Kevin Bacon makes as an actor is interesting.
B00B2G2RG6,Rene',3,I watch this show for Purefoy and Bacon.  It can be quite disturbing but they have made Ryan and now Mike morally ambigious heros which is what the public likes.
B00B2G2RG6,Rev.Carolyn J. White,5,I loved this series.  HAd trouble waiting for the next one.  Very interesting story lines.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Well done.  Kevin Bacon is great.
B00B2G2RG6,R Walsh "R .W.",4,KEVIN BACON AS THE HERO IS AMAZING IN THIS SERIES.  VILLAIN (JAMES PUREFOY) IS ALSO CONVINCING. LOVE THIS SHOW AND HOPE TO SEE SEASON 2. VERY WELL DONE.
B00B2G2RG6,S. Belcher "Tadpole998",5,What can I say?  KEVIN BACON !!  on my TV each week - YUM !!The plot is interesting too (LOL) - Glad to hear it has been renewedfor Season 2 ...
B00B2G2RG6,Sewpippy "I love to read both fiction and non...,5,Missed the pilot so had to go back and watch the beginning!  A great show - look forward to future epidsodes!!
B00B2G2RG6,Sunshine247365,5,I personally love Edgar Allen Poe and thrillers.  What a great way of creating a stroy arch similar to Hannible Lecter but with its own unique twist.
B00B2G2RG6,Tara "Tara",5,Well worth watching and the price is right for a TV show.  If you like crime dramas then you should enjoy this
B00B2G2RG6,T. Brady "Tom",5,This is a no holes barred show where you never know what is going to happen next.  Usually I am able to guess what happens in these types of shows but this is so well put together I am completely surprised about each episode.  If you like feeling like this then get hold of this series and see if you agree.  Test it like they say and only get hold of one episode and then go forward from there.
B00B2G2RG6,Thomas G Caulfield,5,Very dark well acted show.  It's darkness is reminiscent of the British show "Luther" which was also very dark and at times disturbing.  LOVE IT
B00B2G2RG6,William Hodges,5,Kevin is an outstanding actor and makes the show click in my opinion. If the series keeps going as it has so far it should be another FGox hit.
B00B2LCW8O,B.C.,5,Awesome series. Waiting on season 5! Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.
B00B2LCW8O,Brian,5,Archer is consistently freakin' awesome. The voice talent is great and the characters have really come together in the later seasons.
B00B2LCW8O,Carl Patrick Mainwaring,5,This show is very silly but fun and entertaining. It's a great show if you just want mindless entertainment. My wife does not care for it but show enjoys hearing me chuckle throughout the show!
B00B2LCW8O,Charles J. Mcpeak "mcpeak2",5,Hilarious as always!
B00B2LCW8O,Dakota J. Doerr,5,archer is one of those shows to watch when you need some mindless senseless fun in your lifethis show will turn anybodys frown upside down it really is  a silly take on spys and espionage and ifyou have a sense silly of humor you will like this show :)
B00B2LCW8O,Danielle Elizabeth,5,each season they delight me with more humor than the last. this is a great show that i continue to have NEW favorites with
B00B2LCW8O,Jean Marcel Ducharme,5,Thank you for finally removing the ads Amazon/FX.  It's good to see that some companies listen to there customers complaints. As for Archer. The show is awesome what else need be said.
B00B2LCW8O,ladererdaysaint "William",5,I like the Archer shows. Better or just as good as Tosh2.0 only less offensive than Tosh2.0Very funny stuff and down to earth black humor that we all have seen when people stick their foot into their mouth by stuff they say and do. LOLROF funny.
B00B2LCW8O,@margaret,5,I love this adult cartoon. I laughed out loud sometimes watching it. It was well written programming. The characters were entertaining.
B00B2LCW8O,Patricia Appelquist,3,Archer is an absolute guilty pleasure but when the writing which is pretty darn silly and the animation gets wonky you know they are going to the well WAY too many times by having so many guest on it. I mean really Tim Olyphant is hot but could he have been Archer's long lost brother instead? just saying...oh and Pam being knocked up ...I think I wrote something similar to that in my 6th grade writing class dont fall into shameless traps like &#34;baby on board&#34; storylines those belong only to soap operas
B00B2LCW8O,Rodrigo Garay,4,This show just needs to parody Bond movies a little more but otherwise it is funny. Can't wait for next season.
B00B2LCW8O,Victoria Gates "Victoria",5,I truly love this series. Archer is one of those funny nonsensical shows that will just make you laugh randomly during the day over a line you heard the night before.
B00B2LCW8O,Yar,5,Archer is a great adult series that has amazing characters. I love the cast and the adult themesBlah blah blah
B00B2LCW8O,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,Please stop the commercials or we will stop buying these. Clearly someone has lost sight of why we buy these videos. If we wanted commercials we would watch regular tv. We pay a premium per episode for a reason. If you take away that reason we stop buying videos. It's not rocket science.
B00B3A0I6M,Belizelovely,5,I gave it a 5 because you get to experience what other people experience when it comes to buying a house. I like to see what's out there and the types of questions to ask and what the criteria are for getting a house.
B00B3A0I6M,Blanda Lynam,5,It's really interesting to see homes in various cities.  It's also amazing how the color of the kitchen cabinets can be a deal breaker for a great house.
B00B3A0I6M,Dawn Clark,5,This is a fun show to watch and see how couples choose their homes!  It is wonderful see all the different way homes are built!
B00B3CJWTE,Amazon Customer,5,Creative and entertaining. Enjoy seeing what the contestants come up with. The judges are articulate and try to be constructive in their critiques.
B00B3CJWTE,D,5,In my opinion this is one of their better seasons. It is nice to have contestants from other places besides New England. It has made it more enjoyable.
B00B3CJWTE,Donett Murphy,5,Enjoy seeing how to combine strange ingredients and spices.  Also learn about food and method of cooking to strange products.
B00B3CJWTE,free spirit,5,All chopped seasons are great.  As a retired caterer I enjoy seeing what the chefs coose to do with the ingredients as I try to decide what I would do.  A fun way to spend an evening.
B00B3CJWTE,Kelly,3,Nothing really changed. I feel like they choose the person who they feel bad for rather than the best cook.
B00B3CJWTE,Lurch,5,I am not a cook but the talent wow.  This is a must if you do like to cook or just eat.  This is a show to show peaple working under stress and using talents.  There is much to learn and you will love every min. of it.
B00B3CJWTE,Melinda H. Hansen "MS Warrior",5,Season 12 continues the Chopped series without missing a beat.  Can hardly wait for the next season to become Prime Eligible on Amazon.
B00B3CJWTE,Mike,5,I like to see how different people cope under pressure. I am a 'reality show' watcher for the interesting people and situations.
B00B3CJWTE,Richard C. Anderson,4,I've always enjoyed cooking shows and this one is fun but I don't know why this comment has to be so long
B00B3CJWTE,troutpaws "troutpaws",4,who doesn't like Chopped even if you don't cook. just wish later seasons were on Prime. I am a good cook but have become a better cook watching Chopped
B00B3OQK9M,Brandon K Shatswell,5,My wife and I really enjoy this show.  It is mostly cast well.  The idea of peer review for successful and failed operations has been interesting.
B00B3OQK9M,Vico96,5,Monday Mornings is one of the best new shows on TV.  The cast is awesome and the storylines have been really interesting and well written.  I hate to see the show end wach week.
B00B45ABKO,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,The show itself is amazing to me. The things that these MEN put themselves through is astonishing. I'm a biological woman and I can't walk in them heels.
B00B45ABKO,Miss Ella,5,I have been a Rupaul fan since the early 90's.. and he does not disappoint!  This show is very funny.. and over the top crazy at times.  For the most part..the queens are likeable.  Quite entertaining!!
B00B46XTDY,Amazon Customer "LABMONKEY",3,My kids like it but it's just way too hokey for me. Too many gags. Action scenes abound but they are pretty unoriginal. I def don't like the new Nova or Power Man.
B00B46XTDY,Mike,5,Because it's a really good show and it really stays true to the personality and action of all the heroes and plus the stories are well done the only thing is I don't like the pauses in between explain the fighting explaining what their reasoning other than that great show and of course spiderman always has excellent villians.
B00B47LUZ2,CV,2,This movie was so slow I had to turn it off. It had bad acting and the storyline was slow as molasses.
B00B47LUZ2,Route66Review,1,This in no way is a horror movie.  I finally got a chance to watch it for free and it stunk worse than a dead road kill on a hot New Mexico day.  Best advice is to stay away from this movie unless you want to watch a man handcuffed for days and when he's released by his best friend he forgives him as if it never took place. I would have been pissed and started kicking some backside. I'm awarding this movie the worst D- rated movie of 2013.
B00B47LUZ2,Terrie,4,Wasn't sure I was going to like this but it kept my attention. I hope there's a follow-up movie to it. All I can say is the ending left me guessing. Definitely worth renting.
B00B6870JE,Amber R Burkhart,5,I love this series. My husband loves this movie. And so does our 6 month old. Thanks for keeping this series on file!
B00B6870JE,G. L. Oneal,5,This show does provide very good information. I'm not sure I believe in aliens as it is hard to believe in something that I have never seen. But do not let that stop you from watching this series. There is good solid info here and its a great &#34;trip&#34; around the world for those of us who can not aford to travel.
B00B6870JE,Jeff Yaskus,1,I can't believe they charged me $2 for this 2 minute "free sneak peek #2" ?! Any "sneak peak" should be free and this series is already running out of interesting topics.
B00B6870JE,Ospreydance "Kat",5,We love each episode they make - entirely blows the mind - and then they will show yet another example somewhere else in the world on the topic of the week and - wow - blow your mind even more.  Just love it!
B00B6870JE,Paul Aguirre,5,My favorite show of all time I love it the things they talk about in this show make a lot of sense and will amaze you
B00B6870JE,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",4,I love Ancient Aliens!  It is one of my favorite series and a show I can watch over and over - because each time you see an episode you see something new.  I would love to give this season the same 5 stars I've given all the others - but this time around its just quite as good.  Still a lot of fun to watch though.
B00B6870JE,Teresa Pietersen,4,This whole series has been fascinating with amazing sites visited across the world and many researchers giving their findings and theories about the lost or hidden histories of ancient civilizations. I don't hold with everything that is talked about but it does force you to open up your mind to the possibilities.
B00B6870JE,The Doctor,5,This show has always been interesting to me and I think anyone with an open mind who is curious about such subject matter would enjoy it.
B00B6870JE,The repair guy,3,If this is all that there is I am upset It is only five episodes long and I was hoping for more.
B00B7FZE3U,Belinda Roman,5,This might not be the most profound program on TV but it certainly brings back great memories. Who doesn't love to hate JR? Sad to see Larry Hagman pass.
B00B7FZE3U,Bill,5,The new season is excellent! If you are a Dallas fan you won't be disappointed. John Ross takes despicable to a new low.
B00B7FZE3U,Debra Giambattista,5,W.e purchased the old Dallas then moved to the new Dallas. It's a great show. We will purchase season 3 as soon as it's released.
B00B7FZE3U,Fred D. Lewis "Derf8me",4,In the original Dallas form the 1970's there was more blackmail and sabotageand few murders.In this new series there have already been several murders and a bombing and season 2 isn't even half way through!!This could get old after a while. But otherwise the new series is pretty good.
B00B7FZE3U,icewoman63,5,when and is there going to be a season three 2013.i have watched this show since the beginning. I hope your not going to leave it like that. and above all REST IN PEACE JR You will be missed
B00B7FZE3U,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Dallas is back and better than ever. Scheming back stabbing plotting and JR gone but left a plan. So even gone JR is a big part of the plot. Love Bobby. And John Ross has some big shoes to fill but he is sneaky and learning quick. Worth every penny for the season pass.
B00B7FZE3U,Nh granite,5,AS someone who remembers the first run of Dallas this is a great continuation...the great eye candy doesnt hurt either.
B00B7FZE3U,Patricia Appelquist,3,Ok now we all know the scheming ways of people ...a spanish telanova this would be better ...seriously way better
B00B7FZE3U,Prefl96,5,We have enjoyed this season thus far. Very curious to see how they are going to say goodbye to Larry Hagman.
B00B7FZE3U,St Johns,5,Very impressed by this season and thought everyone did a terrific job.  Especially liked how Bobby and Sue Ellen stepped to the plate for the family in being forceful when they needed to.Thought the tribute to J R  was awesome and brought tears to my eyes.I have an idea for a future season of Dallas and hope some day to  send it in to the show Execs for consideration.  Thanks for making this a awesome Season.J R is smiling.
B00B8C6JHM,Amazon Customer,5,of course it was great or I woudn't have ordered and watched it!thanks for askingI love simon baker
B00B8C6JHM,babs,5,Loved this program the story lines were very interesting and the actors all wonderful.  Simon Baker and all of the cast were great.  Not happy the way it ended but perhaps quite true to life.
B00B8C6JHM,BargainHunter,5,What a great third season. As usual I had a difficult time cutting it off when I could go on to another episode.  It was a realistic and great ending to a really good series.
B00B8C6JHM,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",5,I liked the show in this format and Baker carries off the part excellently.  Really got to not like his choices but was kept interested up to the end.
B00B8C6JHM,Joan M. Poole,5,My husband and I both enjoyed watching this movie.  It turned out totally different than what we thought it may have been.  I wish that it had many more seasons to watch to see more the outcome of different things but it seems that whenever we begin to enjoy a show it gets cancelled and replaced with stupid vampire movies and such.
B00B8C6JHM,leo clark "bob",5,good character and he has slowly grown after his fall from graceeach show you can see this man grow as he is exposed to moreand more heartache working with these children.
B00B8C6JHM,Philip Logiudice,5,This is the final season of the guardian and it was very enjoyable. I think there were a few times where it appeared more story would emerge but then nothing more was heard. Nick's character was maddening at times for his refusal to open up and actually speak to Lulu. But it was certainly in keeping with his character.It was a thoroughly enjoyable show.
B00B8C6JHM,Sunni,5,Learning about the children's services even though it was &#34;Hollywood&#34; tugged at my heart strings. All the actors and actresses were perfect for their part.
B00B8C72OG,BargainHunter,5,The stories continue to be riveting and I have a difficult time  not going on to the next episode.  Great stuff
B00B8C72OG,gpat65,5,I watched the whole first season and I am halfway through the second season. I dont know how I ever missed finding this show on tv but I am so happy I found it on Amazon Prime. Love Simon Baker and the whole cast and the stories. I truly enjoy this series.
B00B8C72OG,Jan Funk,5,Simon Baker is fantastic in this series and I was sorry to see it was cancelled after just 3 years. I could have watched for ANOTHER 3years.
B00B8C72OG,Kathryn A. Helmke "Kathy",5,Love this show!  Varied legal scenes that get you involved.  Simon Baker's role is so different than Mentalist -which I love.
B00B8C72OG,KMC,5,See for yourself.  Season 2 is so good my wife will not allow me to watch it with out her.She and I highly recommend this TV series.
B00B8C72OG,L,5,Watched this back when it was on tv - did not finish the series- Simon Baker is great and I also watch The Mentalist with him in it.
B00B8C72OG,loyce "Media Maven",5,Simon Baker and the supporting cast including his father Dabney Coleman were good in their performances and I was addicted to this series and pulled into the good writing/acting and storyline
B00B8C72OG,Small Town Blues "jf",4,Season 1 was really good and this season has been good. There was a little drop in the writing but not enough to stop me from watching it. Again the chemistry of the cast makes this show. There were only 3 seasons and I will watch season 3.
B00B8P8O9K,Aimee,4,I haven't finished the whole thing yet but so far I am digging this first season!!  Keri Russell is badass!! Matthew Rhys is a chameleon!  I'm totally looking forward to the next episode.  Well done!  I wish the second season was on Prime though.
B00B8P8O9K,Amazon Customer,4,Good story line. Acting is excellent. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Some violence and killing.  Not for family viewing.
B00B8P8O9K,Amazon Customer,5,This series is great! What amazes me is how much I feel empathy for the Russian spies. I don't want them to get caught. The suspense is marvelous -- something missing from a lot of shows these days.
B00B8P8O9K,Amazon Customer "Mermu",5,I love the flip of rooting for &#34;the Russians&#34; in a sense. This show has this really deep &#34;shoe is on the other foot&#34; aspect while using those challenges and conflicts to highlight the universal struggle of a marriage past the 7-year itch. Cast is stellar.Can't wait to check out Season 2.
B00B8P8O9K,Annie M daffodils,4,Can't wait for Season 2 to become available on amazon.  Very enjoyable and well acted.  Keeps you in suspense with many twists and turns.
B00B8P8O9K,Ann Shumaker,4,Easily followed. Makes you really dislike the communist! Although our side doesn't look to bright to begin with.  Amazing how writers keep raising the bar.
B00B8P8O9K,artsieann,5,I loved the story. It had a lot of everything in it. I can't wait to see season 2. I think it will be even better
B00B8P8O9K,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,Good casting great story one of the best tv series to date. I must but for any tv show fan!
B00B8P8O9K,awilderirishrose,5,Have only watched the first two episodes and I'm hooked.  Kerry Russel is amazing; always connected her with "Felicity". So interesting to see how successful she is in this role.
B00B8P8O9K,Belinda Roman,5,It is about time TV gave us something to think about!  I love this show and hope it gets renewed for several seasons.  We need more thoughtful and adult programming for those of us who hunger for intellectual stimulation.
B00B8P8O9K,Bill,5,I like the attention to detail - looks just like the '80s. Great acting and good action - the stories move right along! I love this show!
B00B8P8O9K,Bill,5,I wasn't that interested in this series at first.. I gave it a shot and now I'm sold... Along the lines of smileys people (if you remember that series) but not quite...
B00B8P8O9K,Booker,4,I liked the series overall the intrigue between the american and russian spy agencies was captivating and attention sustaining. I'm not certain if its based on fact or fiction or a combination there of.
B00B8P8O9K,Book Lover "Black Book Lover",5,I was instantly hooked after the first episode ! I was at first a little skeptical becase I hated Keri Russel in Felicity but she has honed her acting chops and is phenomenal in this show. I smell an emmy nod for her performance.
B00B8P8O9K,boto,5,I think this show has it all and keeps you wanting more and to know what's going to happen next.
B00B8P8O9K,carolG,5,Very clever writing and concept. Going back to this period is rarely scene in this context.The premise of the story offers a fresh approach to the idea of The Cold War and spies. For anyone who enjoys a tightly crafted story with good acting. a bit of violence and a big dab of suspense you will not be disappointed.
B00B8P8O9K,CatPsyc,4,I have only watched first two episoes of season one.  This show is different and very intriquing.  I really want to see where it goes.  I will surely watch more.  The characters and the interaction between characters is very complex.
B00B8P8O9K,charles ackley,4,Man this show rocks can't stop watching it full of twists and turns. Plus I grow up in the 80s and lingo I remember
B00B8P8O9K,chiefarchitect "chiefarchitect",5,Very intriguing plots and a twist to peak your interest.  You have to start from the beginning to understand that the &#34;Americans&#34; are about the Russians who have infiltrated into the U.S. during the cold war and have integrated thier lives into the U.S. in order to spy and or destroy the U.S.  An enjoyable series and the plots vary enough in the series to keep you coming back for more!Good performances by main characters as well as supporting cast.
B00B8P8O9K,christel,5,THIS SERIES GOT ME FROM THE FIRST EPISODE.  I LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY GUESS WHERE THEY ARE TAKING THE STORY.  GREAT WRITING.  I REMEMBER LIVING IN THAT TIME PERIOD.
B00B8P8O9K,Christopher Beckwith,5,Have yet to find a streaming option for The Americans Season 2 available here on Amazon. Will Amazon make it available or not?
B00B8P8O9K,Chris W,4,Great show from the perspective of the other side.  I know FX likes to push the boundaries with the sexual content but this has a little too much.  I like to watch this on my Kindle Fire and when the scene jumps straight into a sex scene it is a little awkward if I am in public.
B00B8P8O9K,Crashconklin,5,they were fun times. this show hits home 4 me. I loved the cold war not only did we fight Russia but also other groups mi3 china and all other countries had their happy campers
B00B8P8O9K,Dancy Girl,4,Like the series because it relates how the KGB worked/works in our country.  This is serious business and we all should be made aware.  Even their own children/families are unaware of their affiliation with Russia.  I was disappointed that I now must now pay for season two as a Prime member.  I am now tuning into the weekly show on Wednesday evenings.Try it - I think you will be entertained.
B00B8P8O9K,Darren Slawson,4,Great show...a blast from the past.....great production quality...music...storylines....and acting....the only thing I don't like about it is you don't have season two yet lol
B00B8P8O9K,David Fuller,5,if you like spy movies you'll like this. Great drama between their spy life and their family life. Love how they are living right next door to the FBI agent. Makes you wonder who your neighbors really are?
B00B8P8O9K,DD "DD",2,This is a very good series but there seems to be a sex scene every few minutes of spies having sex with other spies etc. This takes away from the show and becomes very irritating.
B00B8P8O9K,Debbie Dillon,4,In my opinion the actors are all very good. It makes you think how easily this could happen or could have happened. It is well written also.
B00B8P8O9K,diane,5,I have never seen a spy story from the Russian side of things. I wonder how close this comes to reality.
B00B8P8O9K,Dorothy,4,Good show.  Peaks your interest enough that you will keep on watching the series.  The show is very well done.
B00B8P8O9K,Doug Henning,5,This is one of the best cable drama shows today.  The acting is terrific and it recreates life in the early 80's very well!  Watched this season live but enjoyed catching up before the equally good 2nd season.
B00B8P8O9K,Elizabeth Marshall "Elizabeth Marshall",5,Most of us don't know and the rest of us have forgotten how dangerous and ridiculous the Cold War really was.  This program is a wonderful thriller and an amazing insight into the conflicting views of situations from both the Americans and the Soviets.  The assassination attempt on Reagan becomes a potential coup to Soviets and another nut job to Americans.  An additional fun thing would be explaining to children what those odd utensils were for in the 80's.
B00B8P8O9K,Ernie Fordham,5,It took a while to get my wife interested in The Americans but now she cannot get enough of this show. We were able to get all of Season on via Amazon Prime (at no cost!) and she was able to catch up and get ready for Season 2.  I loved Season 1 and am now enjoying Season 2.  I wish it was on every night of the week!!!!
B00B8P8O9K,Faye P,5,I did not watch this series when it was being broadcast because I did not especially like the first episode. Tried it on Amazon Prime when I had nothing else calling to me on video.  SURPRISE....I got hooked and binge watched 2 episodes at a time. Now am watching the broadcast season 2.
B00B8P8O9K,Frank,3,Definite 80's. Interesting but not right up there with the real moving series. A nice relaxing series. I will probably watch season 2.
B00B8P8O9K,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,Great spy mystery!  We really enjoyed this series.  The actors were great along with the story line.  We highly recommend this series.
B00B8P8O9K,gabbygirl,2,Didn't ever get past the second episode. Seemed a lot of it centered around sex scenes and talk.Don't recommend it.
B00B8P8O9K,Gary Tashman,5,Great cast. Great plot. You care about these people. I watched all thirteen episodes in two days. Just amazing. Thought provoking.
B00B8P8O9K,George Shaffer,5,I have enjoyed season one and only regret that season two is not on prime as yet....  I still won't pay  up to $1.99 per ep of any shows..  Maybe I have to wait another year... lol
B00B8P8O9K,Gregory L. Erickson,4,I found the story line was complicated yet surprising. I was expecting cliche and yet I was captivated by the twists and turns. It was embarrassing to see the 70's so accurately reflected.
B00B8P8O9K,Guy Portland Oregon "Guy Portland Oregon",4,keri is good and the story is one that has not been seen in a series so far.  they are very active in the job that they are given
B00B8P8O9K,Iceman,5,If you are into our conflict with the Soviets during the 1980's or just love spy shows you will find this show spellbinding. A Soviet family living in the D.C. area blends in as a normal American family and causes havoc in the U.S. as they complete their orders for the USSR.
B00B8P8O9K,James A. Moore "Jim",4,If I hadn't of lived that era things would be confusing. That's some really deep seeded involvement. I find myself (almost) talking to the character telling them to &#34;wake up.&#34; This show pulls you in. Worth a watch.
B00B8P8O9K,Janelle,5,Exciting drama with great acting and thought-provoking story lines. I can't wait to watch more. I am so glad that my brother recommended it to me.
B00B8P8O9K,Jared,5,Ok this whole story seems or at least is plausible for one.  Without any spoilers these are two kgb agents that were recruited when they were young and planted in american.  Want to at least get a taste of what it was like to be spy vs spy.  This is it.  The things they do in this drama/thriller and when I say thriller each episode has you on the seat of your pants because these kgb agents do so pretty incredible and resourceful gathering intelligence and doing what they do best for there country.  This is as real as it gets.  I can only watch an episode here and there because it is so edge of your seat you need a break.  It is the only one out there like it and if you enjoy spy thrillers each episode you will enjoy.  I am 7 episodes into season one and it is awesome.
B00B8P8O9K,J. C. Miller,1,I HAD NO  IDEA HOW OVER THE TOP with sex and violnce this series would be . i will not watch again
B00B8P8O9K,Jean Phoenix,5,The best and most entertaining program yet on Kindle Fire.
B00B8P8O9K,Jeff Riley,5,I love these characters and the setting of the Regan era 1980s. It's fun to see then try to assimilate to American ways and try to fit in even after years of being here. All the people and stories are great.
B00B8P8O9K,Jessica R Schley,5,Actors are amazing.  Story lines are interesting but not overly challenging that you can't follow them.  Love this show so much!
B00B8P8O9K,J. Mitchell,4,Great production and acting quality. A very good flashback into a time I lived through and a view behind the scenes of what was possibly going on. It also tries to present us with an non &#34;american-centric&#34; view of the world and how other cultures may view us.
B00B8P8O9K,J. N. McCarthy,5,If you like HOMELAND you will enjoy this Cold War period piece.  The characters are exciting and each episode builds on the other.  I would recommend it highly for those who like watching &#34;cat and mouse&#34; spy thrillers.  I look forward to season 2.
B00B8P8O9K,Joanne,5,Very entertaining. The characters almost have you rooting for the &#34;other side&#34;.  A KGB couple that is hiding in plain sight.
B00B8P8O9K,joe,5,you just has twist and turns. you just don't know if there going to get busted. an d as the season goes on the risks get bigger. and there odds of survival get smaller
B00B8P8O9K,Joey Abbott,5,Interesting concept of what life was like in the 80's. It's scary to know that we had people in the U.S. that were trying to blend into normal life and working to get secrets. Living a double life as a spy must be extremely hard to have to raise a family and act like nothing is going on.I got hooked on the series and looking forward too more.
B00B8P8O9K,Joy "JTS",5,Great new show with wonderful cast.  Fascinating story line that takes place in the '80's and it's interesting to look back and remember there really was a cold war with the USSR.
B00B8P8O9K,Judy B,5,Wow...so glad my son told us about this series and so glad amazon has it here for me to review so I can start looking for season 2.
B00B8P8O9K,Kathy,5,I just watched the entire first season again to refresh my memory before the season 2 premiere. I have never watched an entire season of a show for the second time. Enjoy!
B00B8P8O9K,Kay Beth Stavley,5,I find the series really intriguing and can hardly wait for the next episode.I find myself wondering if we still have folks who were in that situation.  How old would they be now and where are they now.
B00B8P8O9K,keith harrison,5,Cool series. I grew up in the cold war so this show is a cool perspective. Its also a great drama/thriller/spy piece. Enjoy.
B00B8P8O9K,Kelsey A. Kruse,4,Fun to watch a decent recreation of the 80s. My only complaint is only one woman so far has a Farrah Fawcett hair-do!
B00B8P8O9K,Ken,4,I liked it but found it hard to pull for the Russians.  There were several unexpected twists which make the future more exciting.
B00B8P8O9K,Kenning1SG,5,Awesome show! Events from the 80's are brought out in the show and  show what the Cold War affects could have been.  Also relates how life styles could be for the spies who had families.
B00B8P8O9K,K. Thomas,4,The first episode as slow but if you hung with it towards the later part of the episode it got better. I have only watched a couple of more episodes since because of time constraints ...they do seem to be getting better.
B00B8P8O9K,Lamp base bracket,5,Great show with a great story line.  Actors/Actresses couldn't be replaced with anyone better.  I wish season 2 was also carried on Amazon.
B00B8P8O9K,L. Browning,3,Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Good action with suspense. Anxious to watch the whole season.  Good drama.
B00B8P8O9K,maddy,5,How timely a story when right now Russia is trying to take over Ukrain.  I would assume that most of the content in this story is true.
B00B8P8O9K,Magpie,5,I hope there is a season 2... The plot twists and turns and keeps you on the edge as the two spies outwit the FBI and the KGB....watch it!
B00B8P8O9K,Manuel De La Paz,4,I thought how could spies living in America hold your attention.  These spies turn out to be a pretty dangerous couple with two kids.  They don't want the kids in the family business so they keep it all a secret.  The suspense comes when the can stage a vicious attack or assassination and then come home to the kids and family as if nothing happened.
B00B8P8O9K,MargyL "MargyL",4,I watched the first two episodes and wasn't captivated but read enough good things about it to go back again for a second view.  It really does get better as the characters develop....  There is a whole lot going on in this show and the actors are very good.
B00B8P8O9K,Mark D. Allison,5,I chose the full high rating because EVERY aspect of this series has it ALL and more! From cast to plot to the recruitment of the two principles.... Very edge of the seat content and superb direction! This series is a true five star in my book!!
B00B8P8O9K,Mary Jaeger "Mary",3,The Americans was okay but I will not be watching it again. It wasn't what I expected it to be.
B00B8P8O9K,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",4,I'm not normally a fan of spy dramas as they are usually childish macho dramas of derring do.  Perhaps because of my ignorance of spy methods I find the portrayal of the Russian KGB folks interesting if not always believable.  Not the standard TV fare anyway.
B00B8P8O9K,mayzey "d.littin",5,I watched all of the possible new Amazon Programming that interested me. I thought this was very good. I would like to see Bosch developed and produced also. I do not have the FX channel so I will have to wait until the new season shows up in Prime.
B00B8P8O9K,Mgriffin2312,5,Best show I've watched in awhile! Definitely not for kids but it is a ton of fun for the parents!
B00B8P8O9K,Michelle "Navy Gunner",4,First - Keri Russell can really kick but while still maintaining her "spy life" as a wife with 2 kids.  Matthew Rhys playa her tough and mysterious "husband."The storyline is Homeland meets 1980's Cold War.  The suspense is good - Homeland being the better though.  What I like the most is that they're able to create a 80's atmosphere.  So this is a good show to watch while waiting for Homeland to start up again.
B00B8P8O9K,M. Naidas,5,Who's not to know that this did not exist then and now. America must wake up to see what is going on around them.
B00B8P8O9K,ms,4,It takes a little bit for the pacing in the 1st episode to catch you but after that I was hooked.
B00B8P8O9K,MS,5,This was an intriguing plot. It was VERY real. I like &#34;political&#34; dramas quite a bit. My mother came from Russia.
B00B8P8O9K,Myrna I McKnight,4,Have enjoyed this series. Just wish the next season was available under our prime membership. Amazon seems to do this on a regular basis. Gives you the first season but then charges you for the remaining seasons. Too bad Amazon isn't more like Netflex.
B00B8P8O9K,Mystery person,4,Watch this because I have enjoy movies that Keri Russell play in...first didn;t get it the plot but didn't give up on it just kept watching and now I watch it every week.
B00B8P8O9K,Norm F.,4,An excellent story and a different perspective.  I find this series gripping and interesting.  Well worth the time to watch.
B00B8P8O9K,Not Julia Child,4,So far I do like it.  I haven't finished it yet but I plan too soon.  It was a fairly good watch.
B00B8P8O9K,Nurse Sandie,1,I am a God fearing woman and sex scenes are not what I want to watch so I changed the show immediately.
B00B8P8O9K,Pamela J. Peerce Landers,4,This series is set in DC during the 1980's--Reagan's administration.  Two KGB agents are told to marry and assimilate into US life.  They have two children who know knowing about what their parents really do for a living.  The fact that they live next door to a FBI agent who is with a counter-terrorism unit makes it all the more interesting as they are always on the edge if being found out.Series is very realistic. No James Bond stuff.  Just solid spy craft and missions which are eminently believable.It is addicting.
B00B8P8O9K,Pamela "pvs",5,I really like this series because I lived through parts of this and it really is true to that plus it is so interesting to know that a real FBI guy has been able to pull this off. The story is so real and engaging. I am into it!
B00B8P8O9K,Paul Danneman,5,It is very interesting take on the past.  Don't really know how much of it is fact or fiction. It's a good way to spend some time chilling.
B00B8P8O9K,Richie,5,Pretty great TV series.....I really loved the idea of this show and I mostly love the story as well. Well worth the watch....
B00B8P8O9K,Rick D. Miller,5,Well written and acted. Really like the look back to the cold war era. I hope they keep it up.
B00B8P8O9K,RND,5,A program that is well done and keeps you thinking! I highly recommend this for great period sets and entertainment
B00B8P8O9K,Rodrick Massey,4,Great combination of spy thriller and domestic drama. Really clever premise and Keri Russel and Matthew Rhys really are great and believable in the lead roles.
B00B8P8O9K,Roger E. Ervast,5,I started off slow with this show because I couldn't keep track of what the spies were doing or who was whom.  Must pay attention.  Great character developments.
B00B8P8O9K,Romona C. Bell,5,I had not heard much about this show which airs on FX.  Then I saw a trailer for Season 2 and felt like it was worth taking a look at the free first episode on Prime.  That's all it took!  I was a child during much of the Cold War era and this series looks at the time from an interesting perspective.  Trying to watch all of Season 1 before Season 2 starts.
B00B8P8O9K,R. Roeth,4,The Americans although set in the 70's does not seem dated at all. Fun to watch! Just two criticisms: Plots are difficult to follow at times and so many violent scenes! Despite this I find the show addicting!
B00B8P8O9K,Sam,2,The main characters are too new or too blase' because I found it boring.  They have no believable drama when it calls for it and look like actors on a stick.  Sorry but I fail to see why it was renewed.
B00B8P8O9K,Sam Rashid,5,One of the most riveting and outstanding dramas I've ever seen.  I binged on all 13 episodes of the first season within two weeks and can't wait to start the second season.  Great show!
B00B8P8O9K,Sandra Acquistapace,5,Riveting. I Love this series and hope Amazon will add Season 2 to the prime video section when appropriate. Highly recommended.
B00B8P8O9K,Seb311,5,Season 1 has been really good so far. I'm trying to catch up on Prime before season 2 starts. I'm glad Amazon got this show to stream for free for Prime members.
B00B8P8O9K,Shagnasty,5,Dynamite series with all kinds of relationship nuances.  The Russians are much more interesting than the counterpart Americans!  Can't wait for Season 2 to begin.
B00B8P8O9K,sharon,1,I DON'T CARE TO WATCH PEOPLE HAVING SEX OR KILLING EACH OTHER.  MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING SHOW WITHOUT ALL THAT.  I WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE AND WASN'T IMPRESSED MUCH. DECIDED TO GIVE IT ONE MORE CHANCE SO I STARTED TO WATCH THE SECOND EPISODE AND SHUT IT OFF AT THE BEGINNING.  LIKE I SAID: TOO MUCH SEX AND VIOLENCE.  NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL!
B00B8P8O9K,SoCal Mom,3,interesting story.. but somewhat hard to follow.. not easy to even like the characters.. but better television than the usual fare...
B00B8P8O9K,Stormy,5,Love the setting and plot - right out of my childhood (makes me wonder about several of our neighbors back then!).  The plot and character development are intriguing and attention holding - love the depiction of the Russian mindset that is made through many characters - Putin would fit right in (especially wearing that Super Bowl ring). Can't wait for season 2 - hope the quality of the writing stays at the same level.
B00B8P8O9K,Stray Matter Inc.,5,Great series - Great plot - Great characters and very well written story - The series keeps you interested; every episode
B00B8P8O9K,TD,5,Well written story line with great actors. The Americans tell of a story about undercover KGB members portraying an American family. While the children do not know of their parents real jobs they grow up full blooded Americans. I loved the twists and turns. I found myself rooting for the parents even though it is against the fiber of my being to want anyone to do this to my country.
B00B8P8O9K,Tenderfoot,5,Wow! Having discovered this series by accident through Prime membership one evening on my Kindle Fire I started watching episode 1. After that I was hooked. KGB! FBI! Plots and counter plots! 80's sunglasses! Disguises! Well deserved distrust on both sides! How will it end? Watch it!
B00B8P8O9K,THOMAS,5,Kerri Russel has always been a favorite of mine. Looking forward to Season 2.Growing up the threat coming from Russia was always at the forefront.
B00B8P8O9K,TomG "CW Junkie",5,The secret war that almost everyone knew about. The Cold War seemed to drag on forever until Star Wars put an end to it. The stealth bomber was the final blow.
B00B8P8O9K,Tony AbernathySr,4,Precursor to the middle east invasion. 'Tit for tat' killing seems to be a bit excessive. The other  neighbors must be on vacation.
B00B8P8O9K,troutpaws "troutpaws",4,excellent acting and script. really interesting concept. Since I was an adult during this era and had no idea this could have been going on.
B00B8P8O9K,webbsb,4,I have only watched the first episode so far but this show is pretty good.  I look forward to watching more.  The only complaint is some of the sexual content is a little graphic.
B00B8P8O9K,WednesdaySundae,2,The story was interesting but there were a lot of scenes I did not consider even with the rating (I figured it was on family tv)
B00B8P8O9K,Wife Mother Moon Child "&#34;Grandma&#34;",4,My husband and I like this series so much that we are hoping Season Two will be included In Prime Instant Video very soon.
B00B8P8O9K,Wonder Woman "Jeanne",5,This series is very entertaining and thoughtfully done. It manages to avoid most cliches and the dialog is intelligent and direct.
B00B8P8O9K,Yellowbird,1,I lived in this era and it is particularly hard to watch such a bad portrayal of the events and the times.
B00BAP3J3Y,Amanda H.,5,I love love love this season. But it was so intense. Last season wasn't a good fishing season for the cast because of the tropical storm so I was expecting an easier time but Bruce's season was full of issues. I did love seeing Troys oldest son this season and the inclusion of a Texas team (Texas girl here!).
B00BAP3J3Y,dmlopez,5,We don't really enjoy reality TV except for Swamp People.  These are really down to earth people who live off the land and respect what God has given them.  They will drop everything to help family and friends or even strangers.
B00BAP3J3Y,Jennifer  Sahlberg,5,ANOTHER AMAZING SEASON...BEST YET!!! CAN'T WAIT EACH WEEK......lOOKS TO BE THE MOST CHALLENGING AS WELL...LOVE IT. FAVORITE SHOW.YOU HAVE TO WATCH!!
B00BAP3J3Y,leo clark "bob",3,like other shows picturing people who live and work in dangerous jobsyou must remember there is whole crews in the background that you neversee and everything is made to look more dramatic than it really is.
B00BAP3J3Y,pam,5,Just love this show and have watched it from the beginning.  These people go through a lot just to make a living catching gators
B00BAP3J3Y,Sundex,5,This program that I have been watching since I discovered Swamp People's first season here on Amazon is rivetingly entertaining.  I did not think reality TV could be anything like this.  Well done!  I'm happy to rate this 5 stars!
B00BAP3J3Y,Tracy Christensen,4,They are always adding new faces to the mix of characters and each one has their own unique techniques for &#34;huntin' alligators&#34;.
B00BAP3J3Y,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",3,It seems that when they are reaching the end of their hunting season that most of the alligator hunters are grousing about the fact that they have several tags left to use and are running out of time.What they don't say is that every year they buy more alligator tags than the year before. So I say quit complaining about it.At the rate they are going there will surely be a year when they end up with wasted tags. But that is just like any business.They don't seem to be in as much danger to me as the boys on Gatorboys
B00BAP3J3Y,William Hodges,5,Swamp People gives viewers a real look at how people live and use the swamps to survive. Not something I could or would do but it is fun watching them. I am amazed at the camera work and wonder how much filming they di that did not make the show. That would probably make an interesting show in itself.
B00BB8OEA2,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,4,The young detective known by her superior when a young girl pulls off exciting episodes one after another. In the end of this series they face a defeat together but their reactions to it are different. Enjoyable as well as provocative.
B00BB8OEA2,Dan,5,Very good and interesting show with good acting an interesting plots. Hope there will be many more shows and soon.
B00BB8OEA2,htmcs,5,This series was. very good . The acting was great as well. I would continue watching if there was more. Alas there won't be since the young lady now is on a tv series  here in America.
B00BB8OEA2,Joe Fegan "jfegan",5,This is a very good series concerning a young female police detective in a man's world. i like it. Thank you.
B00BB8OEA2,Loretta Mederos,5,Excellent show the acting is tremendous. Love to watch.
B00BB8OEA2,Mark Wolfe,5,Good plot and scenery. Very good actors. Not to mention the beautiful Miss Kelly! Hope there is more very soon!
B00BB8OEA2,Micky,4,Kelly Reilly and C. Hind(s)? have great chemistry together - I've been a fan of his since his Jane Austin days ... They are both great together and make a great team playing off one anothers strengths and weaknesses.  Where are the new shows?  Please tell me that Above Suspicion is NOT finished!
B00BB8OEA2,Pam Swope "PSwope",5,I saw Kelly Reilly in &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; and liked her.  Then noticed she was staring in ABC's new show Black Box.  It's very good!But I didn't know she was British!  Really enjoyed this show and can't wait for the next Season to be available on Prime.
B00BB8OEA2,Sally Goodin,5,Like the books.  Only complaint is there are only 3 in the series.  The characters are interesting and complex with much more to be explored.
B00BB8OEA2,sila,3,I was a little bit disappointed by the storyline. It felt too obvious throughout and also a bit precipitated as if they were in a hurry to end the plot. The moods and feelings of the main characters were quite strong and yet rarely and/or too quickly justified.
B00BB8P8T8,Amazon user,5,I'd love more episodes to be available (free). This show makes my family laugh out loud and is just great.
B00BB8P8T8,clearanceman,5,These guys get better and better.  They never run out of funny and exciting things to do.  Very creative and entertaining.  You MIGHT learn something about cars too but I doubt it.
B00BBL297Y,Carol B. Anderson,5,Ann Sothern was one of a kind.  This was fun television.  An innocent age but not boring.  She was very good in this role
B00BBL297Y,K. Schonlau "MysteriesinStL",5,I remember seeing this show as a kid and always liked it.  I still do. The stories are charming and warm hearted.
B00BBL297Y,Lurch,4,Fun for its day.  Some of the episodes are missing but what is there is worth a watch.  I love classic comedy but this didn't always pull it off that is why one star down.  But still this is a show worth watching.  Sweet and clean and many laughs give it a try a show a family can watch.
B00BBL297Y,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",3,I love Ann Sothern and this is a great funny cute show that showcases her.  The eposides seems to repeat in the list and the titles are mislabeled but it's a nice collection to watch!
B00BBL297Y,Snookums062,4,I was very young when this show was aired on television.  Now I can appreciate the humor and the cleaner programs of that era.  Not quite as funny as some of the other programs of that day; but you'll still get a laugh.
B00BBVAQME,BHoward,5,We love all seasons of Tosh.  They only get better as he grows as a comedian.  The video ideas are brilliant
B00BBVAQME,ClearBucket,5,He is finally not as far behind on videos like last season so this has made the current season better.
B00BCWNXG8,Nick6684,5,Great suspense movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Well worth the money paid and I hope this movie does really well with audiences at the box office...A+!
B00BCWNXG8,Route66Review,4,This movie mad me very squeamish and I enjoyed it.  This is what horror flicks are supposed to make us feel like when we view them and this one made me cringe and to mention I also felt like jumping in and slapping someone.
B00BCWNXG8,Sasha,4,This film takes elements from well-known storylines and stirs them in a disturbing soup. The outcome is the unfolding of a story mixing some deranged folks with some desperate folks. Cringes can be expected. NOT for kids.
B00BCWNXG8,violet rose,4,this was a cool fun movie..........and what i mean by fun is weird not funny.......it takes adult game playing to another scary level...........yes its another form of a torture b flick but i thought it was a good watch.......and there are some  good cringe moments.........as i was watching i was putting myself in the players shoes & that made me cringe..............clever & entertaining.......a must see !!!
B00BDC29S0,Jack Carter,4,Provided you like his humor Volume 3 is a good one. It is the classic Ridiculousness show program and the content is funny.Worth the money as most of the are.
B00BDC29S0,Jdances "bdancer",5,Yep I guess it's kinda wrong to laugh at people having a bad day with their particular sport.  But OMG this is hilarious entertainment.  Rob is the Schiz
B00BDC29S0,Sophea Uk "sopheasinferno",5,This is funny stuff watching people do idiotic things to hurt themselves and/or others. It never gets old and people never learn.
B00BDC29S0,todd,1,it was an unknown to known movie to be known of i did not understand the opinion of the flick and i want to give it a one star for the grouping...
B00BECZ6N4,A. Fast,5,Love the Dynasty series and really like being able to watch it commercial free whenever I want to!!I have all the series and will continue to buy them as long as they make them.
B00BECZ6N4,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",4,A lot of fun to watch the wild and crazy antics of this family.  If you like down to earth folk then this is a no-brainer.
B00BECZ6N4,Francisco Loaiza,5,I can't get enough of the Robertson family. Truly an inspiration of the American Dreanm come true. Godspeed! Great Series!
B00BECZ6N4,Jenn Weiskopff,4,This season is great just like the others...but they are showing signs that they are not just natural anymore and that they are using scripts. The scripted episodes are not that great and we wish they would just be themselves!
B00BECZ6N4,Jessica Balyeat,5,Our family loves watching this down to earth (LITRALLY) family!  Its great to see families still connected on so many levels!
B00BECZ6N4,Kerry A. Barndt,5,My husband has watched & enjoys every one of the videos.  I have watched a couple; they're funny and interesting.
B00BECZ6N4,Lois,5,Robertsons  are a really neat family and I enjoy there show so much I will tell everybody about it.Where is season 4  bring it on..
B00BECZ6N4,Michelle DuBose,5,The Robertson family has a great way of showing you life's lessons through daily interaction with one another.  Even their simple daily routines have something to teach us.  The show is similar to The Andy Griffith Show in the way that they teach us that no one is perfect and we all can learn something from each other.  Humility being at the top of the list.
B00BECZ6N4,Nan Smith,5,This show is so enjoyable because I know guys just like them. They make me feel at home. Doesn't everybody have an Uncle Si.
B00BECZ6N4,Necrosis "Necrosis",5,Duck Dynasty is a great family show and has some excellent humor at the same time.  Best DD season yet!
B00BECZ6N4,RPC,5,Great show I am almost always laughing at the things they do and some are stupid but none the less pee my pants funny
B00BECZ6N4,Stacie Ridings,5,Our entire family watches the show.  My favorite is Uncle Si.  It is a good wholeshow show which makes you laugh.
B00BECZ6N4,Susan Duffy,4,I've really gotten hooked on Duck Dynasty and I have to admit that it took me a long time to watch it only because of my negative views about rednecks.  Now as I don't identify as a redneck nor would I ever want to be a redneck my opinion has changed to the point were I now have a new respect for rednecks.  This was a great season and I look forward to watching it again.
B00BECZ6N4,Veronica V.,5,I get a kick out of this show and will continue to watch probably until its no longer on the air.
B00BENM4JC,Jenny Crusie Smith,5,Five minutes of perfect romantic comedy; the animation is beautifully done.  Watch it after a bad day and cheer up.
B00BFQ1OFI,BrownCoat 96760 "browncoat96760",5,This is no doubt one of the very best cop shows that will ever grace us with its presence. The cast and crew are the best around. From their finished product to what we see on tv to the fantastic way they interact with us online and in person. I can't even find the words to describe it. You just have to trust. Cudlitz gives the performance of his life in &#34;Chaos&#34;. I will never forget it. If it doesn't get nominated THAT will be a crime.
B00BFQ1OFI,dlrespaul,5,This is one of my favorite shows.  It is well written and all of the actors give an excellent performance.  Too bad it is over
B00BFQ1OFI,Frank D. Castellano "fcaste",5,It just seems that the producers of this show can do no wrong. Great. Great. Great!No other words can express the way I feel about Southland!!!
B00BFQ1OFI,John Cayton "Karuna",4,I appreciate they stuck to their formula for 5seasons and did not sacrifice realism. Sorry it's being taken off the air.
B00BFQ1OFI,Juan "Prince Moloch",4,Although it seemed to be losing some steam this final season it was still heads and shoulders above most police dramas currently on TV. I was sad to see it end.
B00BFQ1OFI,M. A. Griffin,5,As a retired police officer I love this series.  Spending the majority of my career working in a patrol car and supervising other patrol officers the show depicts the day to day patrol car work very well.  The series does a very good job of showing that stresses placed on police officers as they do their jobs and live their lives.  Some of the episodes strike a little too close the home sometimes.  Great writing and acting.I'm going to purchase the entire series.
B00BFQ1OFI,M. Naidas,5,Sad to see the series end. A lot of Fact Finding and reality in the series. Shows what are the possibilities in what is taking place behind the scenes.
B00BFQ1OFI,Nance,5,I have watched this series from the beginning.  It is the BEST serious drama on television.  Great actors and great action.We love this series.
B00BFQ1OFI,Richard E. Moriarity "rikE2iis",5,This by far shows the gritty part of their job.  It shows they are regular people and should never be placed on that pedestal (like real cops).  Cuz when (real-life) the SHTF who will protect us; they will be protecting themselves and their families.
B00BFQ1OFI,Sr Happy Popi "Mr. Stacy J.",3,&#34;Southland&#34; is one of my fav new dramas.  The season 5 premiere seemed a little flat - maybe it will pick up.
B00BFQ1OFI,Webster68,5,Each episode of each season was packed with action and was never boring.  As a former peace officer I enjoyed the way the characters reacted to different situations and related to many of them.  Fairly well true to form for a police drama.  Too bad the show was cancelled.  Some surprising twists and turns were presented.  Very enjoyable.
B00BFXQP46,night player,4,Again I like the Tv series and enjoy seeing some of the behind the scenes of some of the businesses that I patronize. Some are real eye openers.
B00BG2AE1Q,Mike,5,Survivor is getting better every season. I like watching the entire season on Amazon with no commercials and the entire season in one day. Thanks
B00BG2AE1Q,scent chick,5,I love this show - I have been watching it since it started 13 years ago!  They need a new Colby!
B00BG2TX9A,DM "dm",5,I enjoyed watching this season.  I laughed aloud and looked forwars to each and every episode.  What a great series.  Enjoy.
B00BG2TX9A,eblebl,5,Who hates Lucy?  Answer:  No one!  It will always be a timeless classic.  I hope the new generation will love Lucy too.
B00BG2TX9A,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",5,I never tire for watching I Love Lucy.  It's nice to be able to see some of the later seasons as those are not always played on TV anymore in reruns.
B00BG2TX9A,starshining4ever,3,Love the 40s life that it shows! Very cool time in history. Just beware the marriage issues in some episodes aren't appropriate for younger audiences.
B00BG4ULIK,Lisa Frame,3,Not the best documentary nor did it provide any earth-shattering perspectives on the serial killer.  Nonetheless it was interesting and provided some new angles I had not seen/heard/read before.
B00BG69SEQ,Wendy Pullins,5,I love the show but the music is too loud at times that the dialog is hard to hear. Looking forward to more.
B00BH9GD2C,dhar238,5,Awesome show!!! Real cops who are real people with real problems and emotions having to go out in the mean streets of a tough town and keep the order. loved it and hope there is a second season!
B00BHLTQ6U,DM "dm",5,Enjoyed watching it.  Clarity was great.  Funny.  Her acting keeps one interested and engaged.  I always thought the world of her acting.
B00BHLTQ6U,eblebl,5,She is a classic and no one will be able to match her comedy.  It is great that she never had to resort to vulgarity and obscenity to make someone laugh.  She did it naturally with lots of practice and from the heart. Only Lucy!
B00BHLTQ6U,Eric Barreto "Eric B.",5,She's always my go to for when I'm sad hurt lonely and happy. She's been my favorite sitcom for the past 40 years of my life.
B00BHLTQ6U,Millie Lee "Love Southern Fiction",5,It's so nice to be able to watch these old shows. I love it more for the clothing and style of the 50s than for the stories themselves. Lucy's wardrobe alone makes it worth watching.
B00BHLTQ6U,norma jean kringer,5,I am never afraid or hide a snicker when watching these episodes.  As ridiculous as it is it still brings great laughs
B00BHLTQ6U,starshining4ever,4,Funny videos with a point. Some are simply hilarious. It's nice to see the adventures of this happy American family. Thanks Amazon Prime for including this title with membership!
B00BI0OB56,Amy Thompson,5,My child is in love with this series! Every time she hears the music she comes running and starts to dance :). The episode where Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday use the potty was a catalyst for her wanting to use the &#34;big girl potty&#34; too!
B00BI0OB56,DDeyton,5,The message and songs are perfect for alone time or interaction. I would recommend this to anyone with a little one.
B00BI0OB56,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,Daniel is a gentle tiger who appeals to toddlers. His messages show cheerful interaction that young children can relate to and want to come back for more.
B00BI0OB56,Jacqueline S Mihalik,5,I actually enjoy watching this program and even find myself singing along to the theme song! I loved Mr. Rogers's neighborhood so I found this show to be a wonderful take on it.
B00BI0OB56,Kindle MomLKS,4,Kids really love this and its educational for younger children so its definitely a keeper for as long as they will watch.
B00BI0OB56,Susan D'Alessandro,5,No one could ever replace Mr. Rogers but this comes close and has the same magical connection to kids.  The subject matter is good and seems to be lacking today.  I wish there was something like this for when they get older too.
B00BI0OB56,Wayne E. Delong,5,My daughter is four and she ask to watch this show all the time. It's just a good clean show that I don't have to worry about the language or political messages being slipped in.
B00BIESC3O,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",3,Most shows that are about the movie business tend to show a theme about them in a very superficial way.
B00BIESC3O,La Sirene "Maquisar",2,Nothing else to say that aside of the plot is very unclear... and probably as amateur of SCIFI it's simply not my treat .
B00BIFRNPG,Amazon Customer,5,We love this series - the character development continues - finally - a great relationship with her daughter.  New Cop - Miss the old one - but still good.
B00BIFRNPG,Angela Anderson,5,I love this season and since my channel was off on our satelitte I decided to buy this season to watch while I work out.
B00BIFRNPG,Big John MacK,5,This series is getting better and better.The chARACTORS ARE BELIEVABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE and I think the plot twists are acceptable although the cast change between series 2 and 3 was a bit of a stretch.
B00BIFRNPG,diamonds,5,a real fan of body of proof.  hate show got cancelled.  dana delany love her shoes an stocking will be missed
B00BIFRNPG,djdave,5,Love dana Delaney in this show. Interesting to see how her family gets brought into the show more this season.
B00BIFRNPG,happy,5,Dana Delany hasen't been this good- or allowed to be since China Beach!!! Love this show. Hope the network allows this show to continue!!!!
B00BIFRNPG,Lois,5,Love Dana Delany and she does so good in this series it really fits this person she plays and I like it..
B00BIFRNPG,Norman Davis,5,For years now I've taken to ABC series and it seems to me as soon as the show is doing REALLY well they dump it.  Loved Body of Proof.  I've completely dumped ABC. Deleted the channel from appearing on my TV. If they actually put on a series that is decent I'll wait a few years and see if my friends have liked it.  If so I'll watch it on Amazon or something.  But ABC is done in my house.
B00BIFRNPG,W. Simons "Wendi8",5,This show should still be on network TV.  The last season was as good as all the others and I wish there more intelligent crime shows available to watch and absolutely NO reality shows.
B00BJRB6I8,B. S. Diederich "trashartist",5,I haven't even finished watching the first episode and decided to write a quick review--just based on the guy wearing a pajama shirt on camera and describing his old window glass as hallucinogenic and the cat view as 'Suess'! I love old stuff and like the fact that many items here would of been trashed by other folks. This show isn't pretentious; they aren't prancing around in fancy clothes like some of those renovation people (eye roll); seems down-to-earth. Who cares if he might have money? At least he seems like a real person.
B00BJRB6I8,Joan,4,I like watching his show. He gives a lot of new ideas to think about. I hope to see more seasons added.
B00BJRB6I8,N. Foley,5,This is one of my husband's favorite shows. There is a great jousting that goes on between Pinchot and his crew. There is also some amazing work taking place while they are doing that.
B00BKI9048,Candy Cane "Is it just me?",5,Most of these are stories and evidence collected by amateur ghost hunters.  They get some great footage without all of the long episodes of other shows that often come up empty handed.  I enjoy these as they pack a lot of evidence into a couple of stories.
B00BKI9048,John C,5,This show is very cool.  I am fascinated by shows like this that explore the paranormal.  It won't disappoint!  Try it and see!
B00BKI9048,Penny Gause,5,LOVE THESE GHOST/ PARA---YOU KNOW NORMAL!!!!! THEY ARE NICE CHANGE FROM ALL THE REALITY CRAP LIKE DATING--HOUSEWIVES ETC!!!BRING ON THE SUPERNATURAL ANYDAY!!!!
B00BKVI8XO,Amazon Customer,5,Great TV! So comforting to watch a cooking show that one has been watching for 15years and its quality and people have not changed! They answer many questions I have had about cooking over the years.. Not actors real people! Refreshing
B00BKVI8XO,DMT,4,I think this is the best show ever.  It teaches you how to cook food properly and shows you all the latest gadgets to save you time in the kitchen.  What a great show!!
B00BKVI8XO,R. Nichols,5,I love this show. It gives its viewers the BEST way to prepare food. They take the time to make food the best possible way. Then they do taste tests and equipment testing. You can't miss by watching this program.
B00BKVI8XO,Wendy Johnson "Imcyked",5,I have enjoyed this show for a couple of years. I like the way the group interacts and love the recipes. They have tested and tasted every recipe until it is perfect. I have subscribed to the magazine as well. I received one of their cookbooks as a gift and haven't found a recipe yet that didn't turn out as expected. You also get their updates on kitchen gadgets and taste tests of foods we buy all the time. Great show!
B00BLBTEPY,Brian "batfan",5,I think it's just so much fun to watch.  It is nice to have something we can watch as a family.
B00BLBTEPY,Christa Douglas,5,Always fun to watch AFV when you need a good laugh. How can you possibly go wrong watching funny videos on a show for funny videos?
B00BLBTEPY,CrimsonKannon,5,My kids love it all! My boys specifically can't stop laughing. To such a degree that I warn them from making their own AFV moment.
B00BLCHL4Y,abond007,5,It waa amazing. It had the feel of the movie of 300 but better because it wasnt all about action scenes and killing. It has a great story too. Great cast I never heard of and the sex scenes are intense.
B00BLCHL4Y,Ann M. Hoffman,5,This was a very good program. I really hope the series is renewed. Action packed adventure. Hope cable in Ohio pickes it up
B00BLCHL4Y,Antonio,5,Truly stunning acting. The tales of early Scandinavia are riveting. The imagery and scenery used are astounding. Top class stuff.
B00BLCHL4Y,bigncornfed,5,Great show!  I Rarely watch or get into t.v. shows...this is the exception! Great characters!
B00BLCHL4Y,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",5,Vikings is a great series and seems very true to archaeological evidence. And I'm pleased to see that they have used actual historical figures. Highly recommend
B00BLCHL4Y,Brandon R,5,A violent crazy show that has me hooked to keep watching. Story keeps going and going after each episode. All in all its cool.
B00BLCHL4Y,Carole Dyer,4,I would have given Vikings 5 stars but it's really bloody.  I know from history that life was probably very much like it is portrayed.  It's still an excellent series.
B00BLCHL4Y,C. Cameron,5,This is a great show. Really draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great story lines and the actors are phenomenal.
B00BLCHL4Y,ccc,4,keeps you engaged. and will watch the new episodes as they become available. enjoy the history part and will continue to watch.
B00BLCHL4Y,colleen,5,Love this series! It never disappoints!
B00BLCHL4Y,C.S.,5,Could not stop watching.  We are definantly hooked on this series and have our DVR set for Thursday nights now.  But it is nice to know that if we do miss a show we can catch up on Prime.
B00BLCHL4Y,Danar "Ardent Booky",4,This series is just addictive. I saw the commercials for the second season not knowing that it was the second season. Someone told me so I went to Amazon to see if it had the first season and it did. We marathoned the first season last weekend for free with Amazon Prime and then purchased the first episode of the second season to get caught up.Thank you Amazon Prime for getting us caught up with Vikings.
B00BLCHL4Y,David K. van Hoose,5,If you like history and enjoy a great story this is the show for you.  The Characters are interesting and the story leaves you wanting more.
B00BLCHL4Y,Debra Brodersen,5,The stories and characters are great.  I'm very disappointed when Amazon offers the first season on prime and then charges for other seasons.  This is almost a Bait and Switch.
B00BLCHL4Y,diannerae,5,this is a facinating story about the vikings government and how the vikings entered europe and took monks for slaves. It is well written and exciting to follow the family that defies the Viking King and proves him wrong about going east to England which the King said was impossible and a waste of time.
B00BLCHL4Y,Dog Mom "luvtocook",5,The production is just amazing with historical accuracy and references all wrapped up in a great drama series. Ready for season 2.
B00BLCHL4Y,Efrain Casul Jr,5,Give me more of this actor.  His strength in his smile and wit captured my intriguing mind. The ability to express the culture of the Vikings timeline is wonderful.  The sadness is in knowing the outcome of this superstitious blind culture's downfall.  let the writers express a defeat worthy of watching as it has shown a victory of slaughter that made them rulers of their time. My review is a Watch. What do you ink?
B00BLCHL4Y,Ekay,5,Rich production values add texture and interest to this story about Viking conquests and the plotting &  politics that spearheaded changes. Love the men's hair.
B00BLCHL4Y,F. Scott Fitzgerald "Hi Y'all!",5,There are still wars going on in this century and people today are pretty cruel to each other still.  But oh my!  Were they really this violent in those days?!?  I enjoyed the story and it definitely made you feel like you were deposited in that time period and mucking about in their primative ways ... but DANG!  They'd  use any excuse to kill someone!!!  Whew!
B00BLCHL4Y,gregg dunn,4,Loved the first season. Can't wait for the new episodes. Acting is good and the characters are very quite believable.
B00BLCHL4Y,Happy Camper,5,Who knows how the Viking world was?  No matter.  This was a very enjoyable series.  The characters involved are believable as are most of the story plots.  All I know was I enjoyed the heck out of it and am very much looking forward to another season at some point in the future.
B00BLCHL4Y,Ioice,5,This is probably one of the best shows I have every seen. By the second episode I was entranced!! The acting in wonderful the plot and background historically accurate!! It just goes to show you you can doa real period piece with real accuracy without being bored to tears!!! I love all the ax work! Vikings were badass to begin with but this show gives you a more complete look at the real life of a viking warrior and the culture!!!  It doesn't hurt that the talent can act and are burly awesome fighters to boot!!!!Thanks History Channel!! You rock!!!!
B00BLCHL4Y,Jaffacree,4,Different but true to the era. Good acting and great story. Good for those that like adventure theme shows with a twist
B00BLCHL4Y,JCraul,4,I'm enjoying the show.  My husband doesn't care for it.  Thinks it is a little slow but I like the characters and how things are starting to play out.  I think most season 1 of shows are slow.  They need time to build a back story and make you hungry for more.
B00BLCHL4Y,keith harrison,5,Very entertaining take on the Vikings. Personal drama is nicely interwoven with historical bits along with brutal action to create an addictive series.
B00BLCHL4Y,Lauren,5,Amazing show and great actors. After one episode I was hooked and watched all of season 1 over a weekend.
B00BLCHL4Y,LaVonne Hauwiller,4,My husband really likes this series.He watched nine episodes.  Then you wanted to charge for it.I did notwatch it.  It is not my kind od show.
B00BLCHL4Y,LINDA K,3,Disappointed that  these Vikings seemed.......docile. Didn't want to watch beyond episode 1. it was a little slow moving for me.
B00BLCHL4Y,lynne,5,I really love this show. I even watched it a second time so I could catch up for season 2
B00BLCHL4Y,Marianna Conner,5,Thank you Amazon for having a free season for Amazon Prime members. Very action bound sows with great plots and character development . Too bad season 2isn't free.
B00BLCHL4Y,PhilDub,5,I'm a huge fan of historical fiction.  There are a lot of &#34;based on true events&#34; or characters type of stuff in this series too.  Totally an unexpected show to come from the history channel.  Why can't there be more like this???!!!
B00BLCHL4Y,rmb7500,5,I only recently started watching &#34;Vikings&#34; on Amazon and got hooked after the first episode !  The stories are great and so is the acting.
B00BLCHL4Y,Robert E. Leone "Aim Higher Books",5,The storyline was good. It held your interest. I wanted to see the second season but not enough to pay for it. The first season was include with Amazon Prime but the second season wasn't.
B00BLCHL4Y,ROBERT R LARSON JR,5,Entertaining with not too much gore and no gratuitous sex scenes.  Well Done!  I am looking forward to next season.
B00BLCHL4Y,Rob Lynn,5,Hey; maybe it's a guy thing or maybe it's just me. I've had a fascination with Vikings since early childhood. The authenticity of the program is impressive and the historical tidbits are intriguing. Recommend to all; especially the adventurous at heart/soul.
B00BLCHL4Y,Sam P. Morgan Jr.,5,It is a great show but Season 1 is the bait.  Once you are into &#34;Vikings&#34; with Season 1 you will find out the hard way that Season 2 is NOT covered by Amazon Prime.
B00BLCHL4Y,Shad,5,This is like a historical soap opera.  It has history and an awesome plot line.  What more do you need?
B00BLCHL4Y,Sheila,5,The characters are well developed and the plotline is moving along well for the first season. Looking forward to more episodes.
B00BLCHL4Y,Sonja Reid,3,It was the first episode.  Sometimes they aren't so great and it takes time for a series to evolve.  Maybe it will get better as it matures.
B00BLCHL4Y,swims2me,5,This historical drama reminds me of Game of Thrones without all the crazy dragon non-sense. I'm looking forward to season 2.
B00BLCHL4Y,Tootsie,5,Amazing show. Amazing actors. I loved watching this show. I am looking forward to the next season when it comes on Amazon Prime.
B00BLCHL4Y,Virgil F. Keller,4,The third episode was well written and acted.  The story line is gruesome and pulls no punches so do not expect a fairy tale ending!
B00BLCHL4Y,Wolfar,5,My whole family loves this show it is fantastic! By episode 2 you are drawn into the Viking world forever!
B00BLCHXWY,Adam,5,I watched one and then I watch them all In one sitting. Amazing scenery and acting. The history that backs the tv show is interesting in itself.
B00BLCHXWY,boto,4,This is a great show. Excited I started this series. Not bad for a show in it's time. I'll keep watching.
B00BLCHXWY,BuffyMaryland "bargain hunter",5,A number of my friends recommended this show and I'm glad they did.  The cast and acting are first rate and the stories are interesting.
B00BLCHXWY,Claudette Racey,5,Very good show.  Like that it is historically accurate.  Very well acted and the location is perfect! Can't wait for season 2!
B00BLCHXWY,Diane M. Peterson,5,Really awesome series.  Very realistic.  They seem to pay attention to staying true to historical detail.  Great storyline too.  Would highly recommend this series to everyone.  At least give it a try.
B00BLCHXWY,Martin Allain,5,Really felt that Vikings was close to the actual world of 783 AD. Seeing how human relationships have evolved is truly eye opening. Comparing the world of Vikings and modern day Sweden is a real study in human behavior.
B00BLCHXWY,Melissa,5,This show is incredible. It is a lot better than I anticipated since it came from an educational channel. The production quality and storyline are phenomenal!
B00BLCHXWY,melvin watkins,4,every sense the trailer for this series came out new i would enjoy it can't wait for the second dose found a new drug
B00BLCHXWY,Oldsoldier22 "Chief3lw",5,I am a long time fan of mideval period movies. Vikings is in keeping with the warrior spirit of the period along with how men related to women and how both looked upon looting and enriching themselves. Survival of the fittest realistic representation of the characters.
B00BLCHXWY,Pat Etzwiler,5,Can not wait till season two is available! Why do we not have more shows like this? Excellent show and acting.
B00BLCHXWY,Sally Goodin,4,Really enjoy the glimpse into the past available through this series.  Am looking forward to the continuation of this series.
B00BLCHXWY,S. Warren,5,One thing this Show doesn't lack is carnage.  The story is good and interesting.  I wonder how much study went into this show.  I don't know anything about the north methology but its very interesting to watch.
B00BLCHXWY,Terry smith,4,INTERESTING AND NEW. WE NEEDED SOMETHING NEW BESIDES MORE COPS N ROBBERS STORIES. SVU IS GETTING VERY OLD. AGAIN I LIKE IT
B00BLCHXWY,THOMAS,5,1st Season of the Vikings did a Great job in developing all the wonderful characters. Can't wait for Season 2!!!
B00BLCHXWY,William Webster "disgusted",5,I was glued to my seat and before I knew it I had watched all of season 1. the  History Channel has done a fantastic job on this one.Can't wait for season 2.
B00BLCHYKU,Amazon Customer,4,I  like old  stories of Vikings  and find the somber  state of violence depicted  by all the wonderful actors  and actresses  veer entertaining  thanks.
B00BLCHYKU,Brett T Moore,5,Awesome show with just the right mix of historical and fantasy content. I loved every minute and can't wait for season 2
B00BLCHYKU,B Sandham,5,Just now got to complete the first season of Vikings. Can't wait for the next one. Very interesting how the Vikings lived and grew together.
B00BLCHYKU,C. Tully "Chuck Tully",4,This was an enjoyable show with an interesting storyline and characters.  I'll watch season 2 if and when it come out for sure.
B00BLCHYKU,Czosnek,4,This was a pleasant surprise. Added it to my watch list and once I started I couldn't stop.  I like the story line and characters. Decent amount of action. A new addition in the tradition of shows like Tudors and Game of Thrones I guess. Definitely worth the view.
B00BLCHYKU,Damian P. Gadal,5,Another show I thought I'd give a try thanks to a free episode from Amazon.  A very intriguing show that doesn't hold anything back and is fun to watch.  Keep it coming.  I look forward to each new episode.  Well done!
B00BLCHYKU,Donna K. Ford "English Mystery Collector",5,Season 2 is a done deal and I will eagerly await more if the stories are as good as these are.
B00BLCHYKU,Frederic torres,5,The first season describes the first Vikings raids in England. Can't wait to see season 2 should have to do with Normandie.
B00BLCHYKU,Gina,1,Was very disappointed. We were looking for a series we could watch w our teens. Had too much offensive material to continue.
B00BLCHYKU,Gwen M McDole,5,I absolutely love this show. Travis Fimmel is doing a great job playing Ragnar Lothbrok. Thank you History Channel for another great series.
B00BLCHYKU,Jason McNees,1,this just didn't excite me.  poor language skills.  characters weren't exciting.  I didn't even make it through the first episode
B00BLCHYKU,jessica pavish,5,Such an entertaining television show... Unique to what is currently available. I'm definitely hooked and will be back for more when Season 2 comes out.
B00BLCHYKU,Joanne Walen "shaxpur",5,Terrific history told in story format. Character driven story keeps the ball rolling through history. Magnificent settings enhance each scene. Can't wait for Season Two in 2014. Travis Fimmel is a new guy to watch.
B00BLCHYKU,Joseph Marrero "manvscode",5,Vikings is an interesting show that depicts Viking life during the dark ages.  You will be raping and pillaging with Vikings from the comfort of your own home.
B00BLCHYKU,Josette Michele,5,This show captivated my attention from the beginning! All of the cast are well suited for their roles and give a very believable performance. The pilot starts out right away with action and a story that has substance. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys historical fiction.
B00BLCHYKU,jv,4,This is a good show that I enjoyed watching.  The scenery is awesome and the characters are interesting.  I don't know enough Viking history but the overarching plot of raiding north Britain seems a little too contrived.  There is definitely an attempt to accurately portray their daily lives and I like that.  It makes the show richer.It has violence and sex but not as much as some of the HBO shows (much less than Spartacus...)Now that I finished watching the season I am curious what will happen but not as eager as I am for other shows.
B00BLCHYKU,KayLee Osgood,5,This show is gritty and real and i like that. If you dont like blood and gore you wont like this show.
B00BLCHYKU,K. Robertson,1,My son started to watch it and told me he skipped some parts. I just shut it off. Could have been so much better without some of the shots.
B00BLCHYKU,Maekar,5,History channel did a really good job with Vikings.  I loved it. It grabs you from the first episode and doesn't slow down.
B00BLCHYKU,Mal,4,I love this show. Well...used to. I'm about half way through the first season. It started out being really interesting but now I'm getting annoyed because there is so much christianity being brought in to it and I don't care to watch anything about that. I understand it's part of viking history but seeing as the christians in real life destroyed so much evidence of viking culture I can't really stand to watch it. I want to see vikings. Not christians.
B00BLCHYKU,M. Eaton "Caithness lass",5,Can't wait for the next season.  This was so well written and acted.  This series is addictive and a must watch.
B00BLCHYKU,MM,5,This has to be one of the best shows on TV. I hope that there will be more to the first season and that a consideration for manymore seasons is on the burner.
B00BLCHYKU,Paula "Dalmom",5,I really enjoyed this show.  Can't wait till the next season starts. Really good story line and acting is great too.
B00BLCHYKU,Robert Wittenburg "hardbags dot com",5,Very well written and the acting is very good also. It will captivate you and hold your attention without a problem
B00BLCHYKU,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",3,Not too great a story. Lots of overacting. I have followed other series with more enthusiasm but will check out Season 2 to see if things get better.
B00BLCHYKU,Stormy,5,What an unbelievably fascinating sleeper! Can't wait to watch Ragnar continue his ascent - no matter if he actually existed or is an amalgam of mid-ninth century literary invention. Stunning cinematography and fetching cast make this a eminently watchable. Can't wait for the next season or two.
B00BLCHYKU,Thomas G Caulfield,5,Loved the show. Very interesting characters and a fully developed plot.  I would recommended this show to anyone interested in European history especially Anglo- Saxon history.
B00BLCHYKU,Travis Anderson,5,Very good and very entertaining very informative as well. It probably helps that I'm Scandanavian and spent time in Sweden and recognize many of the names of places
B00BLCHYKU,Trunkneck,5,Hell yeah. About time. This very near recreation of the Viking world really takes you there. I find myself not wanting to leave.
B00BLH0TQQ,Deborah Branson "DB",4,Maigret is a wonderful character.  The detective of old is charming and the scenery is gorgeous.  A very soothing series.
B00BMAR7OY,Kimberlily,5,I really like this show its one of the the things I miss since I gave up cable so watching it here for free is awesome. If you seen it before you know how it goes. I love the strange ingredients the chefs are forced to work with plus I love seeing the over confident cocky chefs lose.
B00BMAR7YO,Cindy,5,My whole family enjoys Chopped. It is a great way to learn about some interesting foods!  I like that the competition is wrapped up in the same episode.
B00BMAR7YO,E. Yeager,4,A show for cooking afficanados. Get good ideas on how to improvise with ingredients not used too often. Time constraints seem a little unreasonable.
B00BMAR7YO,Jacob Crampton,5,I love this show. It is interesting to see what they can do with the ingredients. It is a great show.
B00BMAR7YO,Lurch,5,I don't even cook but wow a great show you will love it.  Mystery and working on the cuff this has it all.  I am not a big reality fan but this show has me hook line and sinker.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B00BMAR7YO,Melinda H. Hansen "MS Warrior",5,Can't get enough of this great cooking show.  Four chefs start.  Forty minutes later -- one remains.  Talk about getting &#34;Chopped&#34;.  PLEASE make the newer season PRIME ELIGIBLE!
B00BMAR7YO,TL in SB,5,This show has tension and excitement and is oddly engaging.  I watched because family members enjoyed it so much.  Didn't expect to like it but now I am hooked.  It moves quickly but the camera takes the time to show the food preparation.  I like that the cooks talk among themselves while awaiting the judges decision.
B00BMAV33K,ClearBucket,4,I don't always get time to cook for myself so late at night I watch shows like this because they are fun with competition and I get to see new things I would like to cook when I get the time.
B00BMAV33K,D,5,We thoroughly enjoyed the tournament. The rest of the episodes were very enjoyable. Some we liked more than others. On the whole it was great.
B00BMAV33K,KEN,5,Love the show. Great competition. The Judges are fascinating to listen to and figure out what they are thinking. Good entertainment
B00BMAV33K,Wilson Family,5,Our whole family enjoyed Chopped.  We love the creativity and to watch the chefs under pressure.  It also started our 7 year old experimenting with different foods.  Quite the lesson.
B00BMFHCSU,Carol,1,I love cooking competition shows.  But this one gets on my nerves with the (really bad) &#34;jokes&#34; and with the Chairman's antics....really didn't like it.  Obviously a lot of folks disagree with me as it is now in its 8th season.  Just wasn't my taste.
B00BMFHCSU,Cynthia Robutka,5,cut the cable a few months ago and mad at food network for all there game shows and kicking paula deen to the curb bit still love alton brown
B00BMFHCSU,Gizmo "ctwin60",4,I like watching the cooking challenges since they use foods that I have never seen or heard of. The iron chefs seem to win more than the challengers but it is still interesting.
B00BMFHCSU,Holly,5,Don't have cable television so I appreciate having these fun cooking shows available on Amazon Instant video so I can enjoy it!
B00BMFHCSU,M Parker,4,I like watching the chefs and all the dishes they come up with. I wish there was a recipe book or online source for the dishes prepared.
B00BMFN6ZI,DJ MinWah,5,Wow.....you'd think trying food would get old...but this series delves into more than just trying the cuisine for a region.  He'll talk about other topics that somehow relates to the whole episode...recommended.
B00BMFN6ZI,Freda "student artist",5,Have enjoyed all the episodes and insight that this series provides.  Will be following the other seasons that are available.
B00BMFN6ZI,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",5,Super travels with Anthony Bourdain.  Everyone of his travel spots are down to earth and loaded with chuckles....sometimes outright belly laughs!  I intend to watch ALL of No Reservations travels as I get the time.
B00BMFN9BO,Charity1230 "Charity",5,I like all the destinations and shows in this series.  He is a great commentator and is very sarcastic...I like that!
B00BMFN9BO,lee,5,anthony bourdains shows are alway entertaining to watch. you always have to make sure you eat before watching this show because it will make you hungry.
B00BMKNPFY,mikethemovieguy,3,I watched it. I liked it. It's a cute little movie - with a BIG lesson at the end. I don't think I've ever seen anything with Mr. Michael Angarano but...I DO remember Miss Juno Temple. I like this chick. She's got some acting chops...I think the camera likes her and so do I. THE BRASS TEAPOT is worth the watch people - make some popcorn and enjoy a cool flick.
B00BMT8TYW,Amazon Customer,5,Amazing meals from crazy ingredients. How the judges decide is amazing. Fun and suspenseful.  Try making an entree in 20 minutes.
B00BMT8TYW,Donett Murphy,5,Love this program BUT Amazon changes access. Show went from Prime to non Prime!  Amazon should tell us that before we sign up!
B00BMT8TYW,Erica,5,It's fun and exciting to watch! if your a foodie or budding chef this is the show for you! you'll love it!
B00BMT8TYW,E. Yeager,4,Chopped is a somewhat engaging show that sometimes has really exotic ingredients. I would like to see more &#34;real&#34; foods and the way that they can be used.
B00BMT8TYW,KEN,5,We enjoy this as a family. We enjoy the challenge of competing against the judges. We also like learning how to mix ingredients to make what seems like taste meals.
B00BMT8TYW,Lurch,5,Jumping in and challenging yourself to be better is a great insperation and that is what this show does.  I love the fact that its fresh and real seeing folks think on thier feet and come up with ideas.  It is very inspiring to watch and to challenge yourself
B00BMT8TYW,Melinda H. Hansen "MS Warrior",5,The mystery box items are impossible to guess and it is such fun watching the chefs figure how to prepare a dish with often times unheard of ingredients.  I'm hooked on this show.  Very entertaining.
B00BMT8TYW,TL in SB,5,There is always an element of excitement and suspense when you watch this show.  They consistently get great chefs who work miracles with odd ingredients.  The judges give concise critiques without being rude.  They are just factual and they compliment good work.
B00BMT8TYW,Wilson Family,5,Our family loves this show.  We think the chef's are amazing and it opens our eyes to culinary possibilities we haven't considered before.  It also inspires our 7 year old to experiment with new foods and he's even started making things himself which is fun.  Keep up the great work.
B00BMT9EMI,jks1980,5,This was another syfy paranormal reality tv show. It's been done before sticking people in the most haunted places and leaving them there for a week. I thought it was really good I wish there was a second season.
B00BN4PXO0,Adair,5,My wife loves this show so it's nice to be able to watch it on Prime. Good audio and video quality too.
B00BN4PXO0,Dawn Clark,5,Hop into this season!  The couples are great and the houses fun to explore!  Each city visited is a great way to see the way different houses were made all over the country!
B00BN4PXO0,Nora,5,How you not love every episode of this show. I've been watching it for years and it never gets old.
B00BN4PXYK,Kimberlily,5,If you enjoy cooking competition and cupcakes you will enjoy this show. I enjoy season three much better than the first two seasons. I enjoy all the seasons there after too. Wish we had smell-o-vision though!
B00BN4PXYK,Lisa M Wiley,4,My daughter and I have been watching this together and we really like it.  She is a little young so I have to be a careful about the content. Season 3 has been fairly safe.
B00BN4PXYK,Michelle Polk,4,I love cup cake wars. Listening to the bakers come up with ideas has taught me a few things like the combining of flavors. It is a good clean show that my daughters and I Like watching together and picking our favorite contestant.
B00BN4QA5G,Felina,5,We love watching this show.  It's fun to see the types of homes and what they cost in other countries.  It's like touring countries we'll never visit.  Fun.
B00BN4QA5G,g.hilary,5,I always liked this show...can not get enough of it...but then again am in Legal school andin Law school Real Estate/contracts will be my major !
B00BN4QA5G,Kelly Carlton,5,makes me want to travel more.  It's interesting to see the diverse architecture & variety of other cultures around the world.
B00BN4QKU6,Cynthia,5,I love these guys!  I questioned thier show in the beginning but see that they are truly attempting to understand the other side.  Sometimes they could go about it differently and get stuck thinking that all entities are evil.  It makes for a good show though and that is what they want --- good ratings.  I like how they are careful with these entities following them because it does happen.
B00BN4QKU6,Gary R. Jordan,5,Excellent show!.These guys are a blast to watch while they travel the world getting evidence of life after death!
B00BN4QKU6,John C,5,I have a strong interest in the supernatural so I enjoy this show.  Zack is funny and I feel like I've been with his crew for the past 6 years or so.  It's a fascinating topic and I think they've encountered some real phenomena on the show.  If you've never seen it you may want to tune in and watch a few of the shows.  It's fascinating stuff.
B00BN4QKU6,Leo Hott,5,I give the Ghost Adventures show five stars for its creative investigation techniques & its entertainment value. I love all things related to Cryptozoology & the paranormal & feel that there should be more shows like this.
B00BN4QKU6,Nicole McDowell,5,Love that I can finally see my GAC guys again!  I had really missed this show since we dropped cable.
B00BN4QKU6,Teresa Pietersen,5,The guys go to some very special locations.Great technology used and their own reactions too.Good evidence captured and always entertaining with Zak's passion for the job.
B00BN4R4WE,Lisa M Wiley,4,We like this show a lot.  It is one of the few that my daughter can watch with me (as long as I check the subject first.  One in  the first season was a little too adult for her.)
B00BN4R4WE,Lurch,4,I watched this because of the recommended shows at the bottom of the kindle.  It is good but lacks the how and excitement that other cooking shows have.  I love to see how a mind works under stress but the detail is not here as much as other shows.  The judges don't go into the whys like I would like so some times you wonder why did that person really loose.  Give it a try you may still learn something
B00BN4R4WE,Michelle Polk,4,Enjoyed watching this show from food network. The host is little cruel but the contestants and judges make this show worth watching. We have even learned a thing or two from the show. The competition is fun to watch.
B00BN4R4WE,NO CO Bear,3,Fun to see the different ideas that contestants come with for Cupcake flavor and design but gets a bit old pretty quickly if I watch a few in a row.
B00BN4S07C,F. Scott Fitzgerald "Hi Y'all!",5,I thoroughly enjoyed viewing Season 5 of Dear Genevieve!  Each show brought  new ideas and design tips I can use.
B00BN4V2YA,abond007,5,Julian moore is a good actress in the movie and so are  the other cast. It blends a lot of different elements that make the movie really suspenseful.
B00BN4V2YA,Dog Friendly,4,Julianne Moore is as good as always and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers turns in an excellent performance.  The plot was better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The ending was a little clich&eacute;d but not really all that bad.
B00BN4V2YA,Hotmess,3,I THOUGHT I'D LIKE IT BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT OUT OF THIS MOVIE BUT WHATEVER IT WAS I DIDN'T GET IT.
B00BN4V2YA,Janice E. Garver,2,This is a movie worth watching. I personally don't care for Juliann Moore's acting. Good for watching on a night when there isn't anything else on.
B00BN4V2YA,Shirl in DC "SAS",4,I'm glad I did not pay attention to the early reviews when deciding to rent this movie. It was worth money and the time. Julian Moore was great as usual. The suspense was intense and the storyline was gripping.  Loved it!
B00BN4V2YA,Sunshine247365,3,To put it very simply...it's not awful but it's not great either. I enjoy Julianne Moore as an actress but this movie ok.
B00BOKLAJU,Corvin Adkins "maguscorvin",3,The show is overall good but this season took a odd turn. Half the characters from first season at the Rub disappear and the new ones well are a hit and miss.  Overall the relationships between the leads are really good. However the one lead they simply put the the back was the original Rub owner.  She needs more screen time and more development.  Without her there wouldn't be a story.  Like I said - good show overall but definitely needs work on structure and overall story.
B00BOKLAJU,Megan,5,I love this show! It has a great story line. Most people probably look at it and think oh no way am I going to watch a show about a massage therapist that gives happy endings but it's not just that. That is only a fraction of the show. It is mainly about a woman whose husband left her and her struggles of trying to keep her home and provide for her family all on her own. It teaches people that what she does is wrong but some people feel like that is their only option and the drama of the show is just awesome! So lesson to people who are thinking about watching this show....don't judge a book by it's cover!
B00BOKLAJU,RAM,5,Its so nice that you can download the episodes you miss or episodes you love.  This is a great show!
B00BOKLAJU,rg,4,I believe that this show is one of the current number ones. It actually has a plot that is relative (as in people can put some of their lives with it) and it doesn't get (you know) STUPID. I believe Jennifer is one of the sweetest actresses we have. It's nice to have her back. And 'have her back' in these episodes (he haw). Yep. This is one of the few shows I endeavor to not miss.rg
B00BOKLAJU,Twilight Mom,5,I absolutely love this show...I have watched since the beginning though never seen the movie.  I cannot wait for the new season to come out
B00BOLEKKA,Rev.Carolyn J. White,5,I love history and love seeing how they figure out what happened in these air crashes.  It seemed to be well done.
B00BOLQ6CU,Alvin Oliver,5,I thought I would try this one out and got in on about the 5th episode on TV.  It was so good I couldn't wait to see all the first episodes so I found them on Amazon and was very satisfied.
B00BOLQ6CU,B. Merrill,5,This show is starting off really good reminds me alot of revenge in ways always something intense going on. I hope it keeps up the pace..
B00BOLQ6CU,Lisa M. Ludwig "booklover",5,I loved the first episode of red widow. Really good story makes me optimistic that it will be a good series. The only complaint I have is that Anson Mount doesn't have a starring role. He is one of my favorite actors. Can't wait until next week.
B00BP4WIUU,abond007,3,I think the movie could of been a lot better but at times it was funny. Dont expect great things in this movie and u will like it with that mindset.
B00BP4WIUU,Hiram Davis "HongryHawg",4,.... for a couple of days after watching it. Pretty good premise. Didn't like the ending but there was really no other direction it could have gone.
B00BP4WIUU,sharon,5,Funny and quirky are the two words to best describe this movie. I really liked it. It kind of made you feel like you were a fly on the wall and a part of the story. I would definitely watch this again.
B00BPDFXDA,A. Coleman "A. Mom",5,It's not what I expected! It's better! I can't wait until the next episode. These people are very lucky! Norman is diffidently a momma's boy!
B00BPDFXDA,Amazon Customer,5,Can't help but see that mummified corpse from Psyco every time Norma it's on the screen.  What finally sent Norman over the edge?
B00BPDFXDA,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,Amazing show definitely an absolute most own. Norman and his mom are totally creepy. This show really surprises great quality
B00BPDFXDA,chance,4,Just as you start pulling for Norman to come into his own  it becomes apparent that he is already doomed  a scarier boy than you thought. Meek mild Norman has a crazy button and the way to launch him into psycho drive is always high drama
B00BPDFXDA,cottageprims,4,Some things in this show go a little off the path but it keeps you wanting the next episode to come out.If you like a mystery and thrill you'll love this show.If your into gore horror not for you.
B00BPDFXDA,D. Tinsley,5,Good reinterpretation of Norman and his Mom's relationship.Wonderful acting and excellent suspense. Can't wait for the second season to begin.
B00BPDFXDA,Heather Scott,5,I really like the spin-off murderer tv shows that attempt to portray the &#34;normality&#34; and slowly progress to show how they could reach the mental state they had with the influences presented in their lives
B00BPDFXDA,john mager,5,if you like this kind of movie! see this.the series is better then original movie.i saw first episod. and i must see whole seasen. new seseon starts in april.starts out with a bang. (must see) lots of action.
B00BPDFXDA,L. John,4,It's not often that you see fully fleshed-out character-driven drama like this. Prepare to be surprised and delighted by this show.
B00BPDFXDA,M1Hop2,3,I was somewhat disappointed. There are just too many things that are questionable and the plot just doesn't hold together. Not one of my favorites.
B00BPDFXDA,Marilyn Lee "The BookRook",5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Young Norman is really into being off the wall.  The mother is a pure crazy and let's not forget the older son's return that seems to stir up things between and around Norman.  Looking for more.
B00BPDFXDA,Raven "Raven",5,GREAT PRICE! GREAT AMAZING SHOW with AMAZING ACTORS. Pulls you in and you become part of it. Witness to their lives.
B00BPDFXDA,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",1,We watched only one episode but found this to be too dark and depressing for us.  A bit uncomfortable with the relationship between mom Bates and her son Norman.  Not recommended.
B00BPDFXDA,Stormy,4,I would give a 3 star but spouse really enjoys it. Oedipus covered it better. The story line is weak IMHO and character development is shallow - shock value more important than characters it seemed to me. NOT FOR CHILDREN - nonono!
B00BPDFXDA,STRAIGHT BUT NOT NARROW,1,Yuck... were do I start. Nothing made me want to watch the ten episodes over. The scences of mother and son sleeping in the same bed are really creepy. Poor guy.
B00BPDFXDA,T's Amazon,4,I like it as a series on it's own but if I try to think of it as an extension of psycho I don't care for it much.
B00BPDFXDA,Wendy Pullins,5,I love this show! The actors are great! It's very spooky to watch when you're alone! Looking forward to season 2.
B00BPFGI0K,Stephen Goldberg,5,This is a real Cinderella story. He sounds very nearly EXACTLY like Steve Perry. This movie is worth watching if you want to be touched and also a lifelong Journey fan. Incredible.
B00BQ92SCW,Ronald F. Paull,5,I read about this story years ago. Don't know if the movie was all that close to the article but it was believable.
B00BQ92SCW,Scott Solomon,3,If you can get this movie cheap it's worth the watch. The interesting part of the movie of course id the interaction between the English soldiiers and the German soldiers. That's really the whole movie
B00BQKOV30,Candy Cane "Is it just me?",4,I love these ghost hunting shows.  This is another one worth watching.  It is scientifically done enough to make the evidence interesting.  The only issue I have is with their timing. They do EVP sessions and then seemingly play them back right away...the whole time I'm thinking &#34;what if the ghost has more to say?&#34;  Which is probably silly and a matter of editing.  But I'm just saying...
B00BQKOV30,Katherine Young,5,This show is far better than you would expect. John is a legend in the paranormal field and it goes far beyond hokey and is down right intriguing!
B00BQKOV30,RedRonin,4,He really does try to help people...although there has been quite a lot of controversy regarding the &#34;faking&#34; of this show...especially in season 2.I hope they continue making more seasons.
B00BR34W3U,racergal,5,This is another great season of Peppa Pig. Peppa and her family and friends have great adventures! My grandson is nearly 3 and this keeps him entranced.
B00BR34W3U,Rachel Kessinger,5,And so do I :) She's just lovely and her family is wonderful. He learns a lot about normal interactions like sharing and caring. Love this show!
B00BR4XH7Q,Cynthia Robutka,5,recently cut the cable and like this show. great streaming and no commercials. dont miss cable at all just stream thru roku or on my computer
B00BR4XH7Q,kellej,5,I love the competition and the unique ideas as well as the incredible food presentations.  I always find so many new ideas for my table
B00BR4XH7Q,Wayne A. Seavolt,5,I love to watch the great ways the chefs come up with new dishes and push the edge of what you expect.  Just wish it was not taken off from prime.
B00BS4MQ0O,Dellamae "dellamae",4,I am missing all the older cast. Except for Catherine Bell and the female army character (can't remember her name) it is brand new youngsters.I am beginning to like it as the series goes on because of the good acting. I watch faithfully and it is a good storyline. Clean vocabulary helps keeps me watching also.
B00BS4MQ0O,JANE EYRE,5,Great show. I started watching because of Catherine Bell. I love JAG and was looking for another show with her in it. She is much more feminine in this show and does it beautifully.
B00BS4MQ0O,Marguerite Martin,5,Waited impatiently for the new season and have been pleasently pleased by the new cast members and plot line.  Looking forward to next week.
B00BS4MQ0O,M. Grant "minimum wage extravagance",3,I love the show and watched every single one. This cast was good but I grew too interested in the previous ensemble of actors. They really throw you into whats going on and what people have to experience. The focus was always on how they helped and supported each other and what happened after the crisis. Life carried on and they bared witness to each other's lives.
B00BS4MQ0O,Pamela S. Halbig,5,This show continues to be enjoying to watch.  Some of the old cast leave and new cast members join the show.  It still is a good and interesting season.
B00BS4MQ0O,scent chick,5,I have  watched this show since it started.  Love this show!  It is one of my favorites.  This season is not my fav.
B00BSG69FA,LacrosseD "LacrosseD",5,Four year old son watches this a lot.  One of his favorites!  Nostalgic for Dad too.  On to the old movies!
B00BSXN46U,Keith A. Hartshorn,5,I have always loved this show and Guy makes it even better.  He makes you want to visit every one of the places he shows.
B00BTWG9R6,robert robinson,4,I liked the movie as a whole for children. I don't think that children should grow up thinking that it okay to punish someone that they are threaten by out of jealousy: when the Superhero(dad) took the advice of a computer to spinal tap his wife co-worker.2) How did the Superhero(dad) know that his wife co-worker had sabotage her computer.
B00BTWG9R6,WednesdaySundae,4,Reminds me a little of The Incredibles except that none of the characters have super powers.  The computer was funny. :D If this became a movie I think a lot of kids would like it.
B00BTWGJEE,Rw Scolari "navy689",4,This is a fairly standard good guy v. bad guy movie.  The characters were interesting.  I think this movie could be made and would be a worthwhile view..  It's success would depend upon good live actor casing.
B00BTWGJEE,TheRaven,1,Did bot finish watching this it was a boring cartoon. Amazon made a mistake this one.  Should habe had real people and real breast.
B00BUJ5YHO,specialkrp,4,I have always wanted to see a documentary about The Amityville house (that was good). I have seen others about the things that happened there but never told by someone who actually was a family member of the Lutz family that lived there. This documentary is about the son Danny of the Lutz family telling his story of what happened there while they stayed their very short stay in the infamous house. This is definetely the best doc about the strange supernatural occurances that happened there. A must see for documentary fans and fans of the Amityville horror story.
B00BW75MKI,A. House,5,This was worth buying if you are a Dr Who fan like me. It was action packed as most episodes are.
B00BW75MKI,Amber Barefoot,5,This was a mind blowing episode.  I absolutely loved it.  The Doctor and River's reunion was more than I could have hoped for.  I also loved the interaction between Clara and River.  Can't wait for the 50th anniversary.  Hopefully we'll see more of River in series 8.  Moffat has once again out done himself.
B00BW75MKI,Annamarie Lubow "Anna",3,The entire Clara storyline is getting boring and this season is not holding me as well as other seasons have.  I really hope season 8 is better.
B00BW75MKI,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",4,Compared to the past few years Dr Who s7pt2 is a disappointment. That is hard for a diehard Whovian to admit.
B00BW75MKI,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",5,Still as a Dr. Who fan for 30 years or more I can say with some confidence that I will love the remaining episodes. The new companion is so pretty to look at. When she comes up with some smart solution it is the best.
B00BW75MKI,car992,5,Love watching Doctor Who.  At least once a year I have to go watch all of them from the first one to the end.  Always can't wait for the next Doctor.
B00BW75MKI,Carol J. Rader "crdvm",5,So nice to be able to get an episode at a time as soon as the day after it airs
B00BW75MKI,Chad,5,Great season but it's a set up for the special so you will be left having to watch that to feel satisfied.  You probably will anyway but just know if you had plans on missing the specials and just going right into the next season those plans are dead.
B00BW75MKI,Christopher R. Williams,5,I started writing this review and now I'm not sure where i am at i needed to get access online because my cell was slow so i looked for wifi and now i dont know where i am.......
B00BW75MKI,ColinMcKie,5,Dr Who continues to get better all the time - Jenna Lousie is a great companion - bit cheeky at times but livens the show up a lot! Enough said!
B00BW75MKI,cybernard,5,Just when the bad guys think they have a fool proof plan there is the Doctor to show them the error of there way.
B00BW75MKI,Daniel D Duran,5,This is the season where Matt Smith truly becomes the Doctor.  He totally owns the role in his own unique way.
B00BW75MKI,Danielle Elizabeth,5,after many years of watching i have finally found MY doctor and this may finally be the companion that i have always hoped for the doctor to have...
B00BW75MKI,Deanna R Taylor,4,The last two seasons became a bit boring to me beings themes of previous shows were repeated.  I also never had the enthusiasm for Matt Smith that I did for David Tennant.  It's still a fun series.
B00BW75MKI,DMZE "Eric",5,Enjoying Clara and the Doctor's puzzlement at just when he saw her past or future... The reborn Tardis is great also. New season off to a great start. Cheeky!
B00BW75MKI,Don Montgomery,5,I love this series and watch it no matter what. There is always something to think about and the value system of courage and self sacrifice is sorely needed in our world today.
B00BW75MKI,Elrod,4,It's good But due to the gap mid way thru the flow of the story was broken up and it hurt it over allI'm sure going back and watching the whole season it will be much better
B00BW75MKI,Eric Schneider,4,Once again it really needs a 4.5.  The final episode seamed rushed.  A big mystery had a reveal but without the build up or discovery process.  Apparently you need to watch season 50 before this.  I think the episode with David Tennant and Matt Smith.  It is a good lead in to the December 2013 final Mat smith episode.
B00BW75MKI,G. Repetti,4,A decent episode. I am not sold on his new companion yet.  Clara hasn't grown on me like his previous gal pals have. Time will tell if she does.
B00BW75MKI,Guy in a chair "grottogreeno",5,Matt Smith is the bomb; he's the sean Connery/james bond of every dr who actor who preceded.  Amelia pond is drop dead gorgeous and a very good actress.  The show appeals to all in our household from 60 to 12 yrs old.  That's a first.Damn clever writing...the best on the screen
B00BW75MKI,Holly,5,Season 7 part 2 did not disappoint. Great action and fun characters. Darker than season 5 and 6.  Will miss Amy and Rory though
B00BW75MKI,I Teach Typing,5,Usually the Dr Who Christmas episodes are largely stand alone but you must watch the one that precedes this half season (The Snowmen) to understand the story arc that runs over all these episodes.  The acting of both Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman is wonderful and the chemistry between them is great. This is worth the cash....
B00BW75MKI,Jacqueline "ys diva",2,It really feels like Moffat is squeezing everything and the kitchen sink into this part of the season. I'm interested in Clara but don't really care about the mystery surrounding her. It feels like the showrunner has lost his passion for the series and it makes me wonder if the 50th anniversary is going to be what long time fans hope. Classic Who needs more than a mention and a shove under the rug like it's getting on the show this year.
B00BW75MKI,J.B.G. "icr4trth",4,Two moments  stand  out  in this  episode -  the  motorcycle  climb  up  the side  of  the  building  and  the moment when Clare  discovers  the  source of the GI  through  FB  (she  is  so brilliant  -  a  great  challenge  to the  Doctor).  We are  fans  but  this  isn't  one of the most  brilliant  of  episodes.  Clare/Oswain is  the  best  companion  and that's  saying  quite  a  bit.
B00BW75MKI,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,I know I dig it and if you do catch this episode as it won't disappoint!  One for the ages as most episodes are.  Just do it!
B00BW75MKI,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,They are working towards something big hidden clues are everywhere.  It is all leading to something big.???? A new doctor?  Maybe. Return of the time lords. Possibly. It will be interesting to see where it goes.
B00BW75MKI,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",4,i recommend watching it. Very well done. Not firefly but it is is good. Better than most other shows.  1
B00BW75MKI,Kbaby59,5,The only regret that i could possibly have is that i ran out of episodes to watch. Dr.Who is great fun.
B00BW75MKI,lenmaster93,5,I love Clara.  She reminds me of Rose a bit.  Definitely going high up on my list of favorite companions.
B00BW75MKI,Lolo,5,fun entertaining episodes. this doctor is very good and energetic compared to other doctors. great way to pass the time
B00BW75MKI,Me,5,Wonderfully entertaining and easy to follow.  The plot twists are unexpected and interesting.  DOCTOR WHO would be proud of this new addition to the saga!!!
B00BW75MKI,Michelle King,5,my kids and I love this show.  It is a great family show and you never have to worry about it showing anything the kids should not see.
B00BW75MKI,notwing,5,DR whoozeee cant get the show any more.  had to request additional channels to watch everything.  even stayed up late. (sat 2 or  3  am.)  enjoyed so much.  When does the next season start.  i'm waiting!!!!!
B00BW75MKI,Ronald Dillenburg "Ron D",5,Another great Whovian adventure season. Might get you thinking more about the paradoxical possibilities of time travel. Great fun for those who like deep challenges of the mind with their fantasies.
B00BW75MKI,Ryan Pritchard "thor_oakenfelder",5,Clara Oswin Oswald is a great companion. these episodes are a group of really fun ones. Journey to the Center of the Tardis and Name of the Doctor are both really strong. A great leadup to the 50th anniversary special.
B00BW75MKI,R. Young "LORD's Servant",5,Well this one is a good as the rest. I do not know s I have seen a bad Dr. Who. episode.  The new cohort/sidekick is extra easy on the eyes and the whole story follows the who themes.  A good watch.
B00BW75MKI,Shortcake,5,I really hate this series is ending.  This story is intriguing and I was so disappointed when there wasn't another Doctor Who to follow and find out what was happening. Please make more soon.
B00BW75MKI,splash "splashjam",5,We can't wait to see what more this season has in store for us with the Great Doctor. We especially love the Doctor's humor.
B00BW75MKI,Stacy Harman Holloway,5,Wasn't prepared to like the new companion...who could follow Amy Pond? But I liked her and I liked the new season so far.
B00BW75MKI,susan,5,love this british forever running series when one who dies the new who takes over we all have our favs but as long as there are writers to write the who in the Dr well .... who will live on
B00BW75MKI,WednesdaySundae,3,Im not a Matt Smith nor Clara fan so but I love dr who =  3/5. The stories are good.. I just am not a fan of the characters here despite the extra graphic work etc..Some of these pieces seemed rather unresolved to me as .. like we should be looking for a next part?.. I do like how they tie some of the older stories in such as when River returns briefly.
B00BWJD4MO,Brenda Santiago,5,story line is great!  I wish this was on when my kids were teenagers because the story line is close to what I went thru in high school and I know most teens can relate...
B00BWJD4MO,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,4,I must be out of touch. My sex life was not this active when I was in high school so I am unsure if this is JH/HS appropriate. But I guess this is what they watch on MTV. Was interesting enough as a study of what teens are watching.
B00BWJD4MO,Crystal Jackson,5,It just got better and better and kept my interest going for the next season.  I liked how the characters evolved.  I'm wondering if they will develop any of the background characters even more in the next season.
B00BWJD4MO,Daniel Lalor,3,I found this funny despite being outside the target demographic for this show. I see the language has changed but high school has not. This is good for a nostalgic laugh remembering all the high school drama from so long ago. There is however a lot of sex and course language. NOT for the tween set despite internet porn desensitization.
B00BWJD4MO,joan,5,I love Awkward and can't wait for the next season to begin!  I love all the characters and I really like Sadie's attitude!!
B00BWJD4MO,Knight68 "EM",3,I didn't watch any of this seasons episodes.  I knew after one episode of the first season that the show was not meant for my generation.  Had I been a teenager the show would have rated better than three stars for sure.
B00BWJD4MO,Martin Allain,4,A high school student weeding through the culture of high school and her mothers fears and needs. It is humorous and interesting to see the challenges she faces
B00BWJD4MO,Melesio Gonzalez,4,It is very enternainig though not realistic. There aren't any parents that would allow their children unfettered sexual freedom at 16.
B00BWJD4MO,Melissa,4,some of the stuff is really annoying but funny and entertaining i hope they continue with this show and yeah
B00BWJD4MO,mrs natural,5,We came across this show on our amazon prime account and started watching it. Even though it would be more of a &#34;teenager&#34; type of show it was entertaining.  We have many nights when there is nothing on cable and go searching for something decent to watch.
B00BWJD4MO,Sammie Kaie "Sammie",4,Cute litlesseries. Kid friendly BUT with a bit of an adult theme and implied sexual content. Nothing kids don't see on TV on a daily basis.
B00BWTIXFC,JH,5,I just like her. There is something calming about her voice and tempo that I enjoy. Her recipes look too old school in fat and sugar so I have never cooked anything she makes but still I find her very enjoyable to watch.
B00BWTIXFC,Joan M. Poole,5,This show rocks.  I don't cook for the amount of people Ree does but she gives a lot of great tips.  I liked her cooking techniques so much that I bought both of here cooking books and also the book on how she wound up on a ranch in Oklahoma.  Can't wait to start reading these books and trying new recipes and also laughing at her story.
B00BWTIXFC,Nana4,4,Have never seen this before and glad I checked it out. Hard working ranch family with good recipes for the table.
B00BWTMT5M,Joan,5,I wish he could crash my yard. The show helps me to get a good idea of just how much goesinto fixing a yard. I love the show!Joan M.
B00BWTMT5M,Penny Stuart,5,I can't wait to watch more! It's a great filler for the end of night t.v. watching and when I'm not in a movie mood! Love Ahmed.....keeps me laughing!
B00BWTSZXW,Cynthia Robutka,5,love these shows. too bad amazon no longer has food network stuff on prime. we cut the cable and i rely on these shows
B00BWTSZXW,Donett Murphy,5,Love this program. I was surprised to know that the show was available any time. Fun to see how things are made.
B00BWTSZXW,Gaff,5,I have been a big fan of this show for years. It's great to watch and learn all about the every day food that comes our way and to learn how it all comes together for the public's pleasure.
B00BWTSZXW,Swamp Girl "Mae",5,Unwrapped is always a joy to watch!  It's always entertaining and you always learn interesting facts about how foods are made and their history.  The best part is I can watch this show without having to worry about offensive or inappropriate content.
B00BWUK6DS,Darlene Walker,3,The show is okay but the new instant video format is horrible.  You can not tell at a glance which shows you have watched and which you have not so you have to go into each one and check it out.  All of my shows are their but not all of my history.  I can not see how it improves my viewing experience at all!!@!!!!!
B00BWUK6DS,ERB,5,Innovative storage and optimum usage seem to be the basics of living in truly tiny spaces. I admire those who choose this lifestyle and the freedom it seems to bring them.  The designs are brilliant and it was great fun to see how you can make a small footprint live &#34;large&#34;. Enjoyed these segments very much and now want to throw out half of what I have!
B00BWUK6DS,Joyce A Campbell,5,This show has lots of beautiful and fun ideas.  Very good place to get ideas and inspiration for their own projects.
B00BWUK6DS,NO CO Bear,3,If you have dreamed of downsizing and getting rid of a lot of stuff in your home this series will give you some ideas.  My only complaint is that the video style is too herky-jerky.
B00BWUK6DS,Xicily,5,I love this series. I would purchase another but don't seem to find it. It is chuck full of great ideas and inspiration if you live in a small space or may have to downsize. I highly recommend it.
B00BWUKO94,K.S. "Sunshine",2,The shows is good for riches who are affordable to pay too much for rent or own... I think it is a waste money to pay too much for rent .. or purchase... It is not worth to watch anyway as it;s my opinion.
B00BWUKO94,lee,5,wish some of the other seasons were free.. If you have watched million dollar listing it is kind of like that show.
B00BWUKO94,N. Foley,5,Really love this show because it is an intelligent portrayal of business. This isn't about drama but smart business people dealing with sales obstacles and opportunities. It is also interesting seeing some beautiful properties that although out of my reach are within my grasp. New York has some wonderful architecture that is much appreciated from my armchair vantage point.
B00BWUKO94,Terri,5,Love this show! Love to see how picky people in New York are when they are looking at million dollar apartments!
B00BX3X4IS,Amazon Customer "Grandpa Jack",5,I learn so many things about foods and techniques from this show. I trained to be a chef 46 years ago and I am still learning things.Watch this series. It's f8un and you'll learn some neat things.
B00BX3X4IS,D. K. Peel "jstkdn",5,This is a program I have enjoyed for years.  It is informative and educational. The recipes are well explained and usually ease to create
B00BX3X4IS,Striving4Excellence,5,We loved this show. It teaches in a very fun way.You learn the origin of food items. How to cook in many different ways.This is a great show. It is not available on DVD so please bring it back.PLEASE BRING THIS BACK TO PRIME FREE.
B00BX3X4IS,Varian David,5,I love the Good Eats series. It's always been informative with nuggets of trivia and easy steps to making dishes featured on each episode. Alton always comes up with innovative ways and shortcuts to to get restaurant quality dishes in the home!
B00BXKH9QE,Amazon Customer "curling acs",5,Always fun watching Alton Brown and generally pick up a trick or two for the kitchen.  Very enjoyable to watch.
B00BXKH9QE,Amazon Customer,5,The Best Cooking Comedy on TV!Love the Alton Brown Comedy & Science approach to cooking.Beware of the burping yeast. :)
B00BXKH9QE,Chris St Pierre,5,Always has been my favorite cooking show. He seamlessly blends a little geek with a whole lot of good cooking . Brown is down to earth and very easy to follow along with.
B00BXKH9QE,Ixias,5,Great fun even if you do not cook. Plus science of food segments so I always learn something. You love it.
B00BXKH9QE,Jean Bender,5,Alton Brown is engaging and funny all while teaching you how and why you prepare food the way you do. Great for learning chemistry in baking.  I highly recommend it to pros and baking beginners.
B00BXKH9QE,OKCOK,5,Alton Brown is one of the few chefs that both my husband and I enjoy equally! He always has an array of fascinating information delivered with humor!
B00BXKH9QE,V Johnson,5,I really liked the variety of recipes in this season.  Most were the kind that I would actually want to cook.  They were not as exotic as some he does.
B00C0OLPK8,dhar238,5,Loved it. I like eyewitness recreation type stories like A Haunting and Paranormal Witness. Can't wait to see more episodes!!
B00C0OLPK8,h3liflyer,3,These are OK shows...some of them seem a little hokey. I used this show as a filler when Paranormal Witness goes on hiatus. It was not as fulfilling or very scientific based.
B00C0OLPK8,Mark C. Meyers "Doc Savage collector",5,Shows like this are a hoot to watch as people investigate strange reports in different areas of the USA. Great download for &#34;Amazon Instant&#34; for your library!
B00C0OLPK8,The Working Dead,5,A well recreated series of stories about paranormal experiences and encounters with all sorts of creepy monsters/creatures. I absolutely recommend it.
B00C0OLT6S,Alfonzo "charter duck",3,I gave it only three stars because it was a bit racey for our kids.  Worth watching if you watch the pilot first.
B00C0OLT6S,Amazon Customer,5,I have found this show very entertaining. There is good development with the story and characters. I don't think you need to be a syfy fan to enjoy this show. Has a little something for everyone.
B00C0OLT6S,Amazon Customer,3,My younger daughter would probably give this more stars than I did.  I am not fond of the setting and there is something missing.
B00C0OLT6S,Amazon Customer,5,wonderful!!!! great characters!  Grant Bowler is fabulous in this show!! Julie Bentz is a great mayor and the action is fabulous!!
B00C0OLT6S,Amazon Customer,4,Very interesting angle on the aliens take over the world and how we get through.  I enjoyed the pilot and will check out more
B00C0OLT6S,aweewee,4,This is a great show.  I loved it and cannot wait until further seasons are released.  Very interesting concept and a great cast.  Time Warner Cable is about to be come a thing of the past!
B00C0OLT6S,AZ Cactus,5,I love the characters and the theme in which it includes aliens from different planets coexisting together in Defiance. St Louis will never be the same!
B00C0OLT6S,Bill E. Bissett,5,Mother earth with a whole new twist complete with all kinds of new residents.  Super action battles and ploting characters that may and may not look or sound like your next door neighbor.  Good time for the whole family(maybe not small children)
B00C0OLT6S,Blue Moose,3,Not really that good. It very often deteriorates into minutia. It seems to have no real direction for the plot.
B00C0OLT6S,Chris Crawford,3,I'm going to wait and see another episode before I can really decide. It appears to be the same story as several before it. I'm hoping that something will change in the next episode.
B00C0OLT6S,Crashconklin,5,HOPING 4 SEASON 2 SOON LOVE IT. GREAT STORY WELL DONE HOPING CAST STAYS THE SAME. THAKNK U SCIFI CHANNEL
B00C0OLT6S,DENISE NAVARRO,5,What a great show especially if you like science fiction . Has a great theme but was sorry to only be able to watch one season. Kind of left me in the dark.
B00C0OLT6S,Diane "Geepa",5,This series.does draw u in. If I like syfy u definitely will enjoy this series. I found it a bit of many other series intertwined. I most definitely will continue watching its series and hope they will continue it. I get so tired of networks cancelling good series after 14 episodes or one season. Don't u.
B00C0OLT6S,dulcibell "dulcibell",3,OK series. Not enough explanation of prior events leading up to the situation the races find themselves in at beginning of series.
B00C0OLT6S,DVSRomad,5,Found this show to be well written and well acted.  Was entertaining and the characters memorable.  I will now be watching the new season as I am a fan now.
B00C0OLT6S,Entertaining Read,4,Not much back ground given. Stories each week kind of lead you to make a conclusion on what has happened. A lot of love hate relationships.  It keeps unraveling slowly. Just want to see next episode.
B00C0OLT6S,GA girl,5,Never let down by this show.  I have become a great big fan!  Every episode does not disappoint!  Feel free to buy this one.
B00C0OLT6S,gary blakely,5,interesting edgey entertainment from SYFY channel.......rough tough cowboy town of the future ....take a chance and watch on a rainy weekend
B00C0OLT6S,George Shaffer,5,UP to now I think Farscape is my fav syfy of all time.  Since Rockne O'Bannon is involved I suppose that is why Defiance is right up there....at the top.  Just the right mix of  Sci  and Fi  ....
B00C0OLT6S,gramdon,5,I enjoyed this show immensely.  A different take on our future and what is going to happen.  If you like different views on the future this is a good show to check out.
B00C0OLT6S,Jaffacree,5,Awesome show. Acton drama comedy all rolled up into one. AmaZing story that keeps you guessing on the outcome. Can't wait for season 2
B00C0OLT6S,JJ,5,I watched this show about 3 or 4 cultures living together.  It was very imaginable and well done!  I am sorry to see it never made it!
B00C0OLT6S,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",3,Some unnecessary sex scenes but on the whole interesting plot progression. The next season could be better and less obvious who is doing what.
B00C0OLT6S,Keisha L. Jones,4,I like this show.  It is interesting enough to have me watch it each and every week.  I do enjoy the fact that I get to see the most recent episode within days of having been aired.
B00C0OLT6S,M. A. Griffin,4,I like the program so far.  Good characters and story line.  Looking forward to season 2 to see what direction the story goes and for new characters to be introduced.
B00C0OLT6S,Mardee "Mardee",5,I love it!! I can't wait for Season 2. I was really glad they didn't kill off anyone I liked.
B00C0OLT6S,@margaret,5,A typical sci fi. I was wondering it's there only one season of this. I watch the whole season in two days
B00C0OLT6S,Martin Allain,4,Not my traditional like. The interaction is good and has kept me interested. This is another series that I would suggest you give a try.
B00C0OLT6S,Mary E. Shipman "LizMoves",5,Love this show. It's presents a complex and interesting world. Sci Fi at its best!
B00C0OLT6S,Money_Maker,4,This one is good but it has the same making of alot of other movies I've  seen but still good
B00C0OLT6S,Mrfil7 "Swissman in D.C.",5,This is an amazing science-fiction show. For some reason this reminds me a little of a cross between the fifth element and firefly. The actors are good and the different races are a cool element to the story that plays an integral part to the story.Again this is just the first season but it seems this could become an amazingly deep show!
B00C0OLT6S,Pamala Pickard,4,It was riveting with enough action to hold my interest but some outfits were too  scanty and there was some bad language.
B00C0OLT6S,Pam Swinson,5,Awesome cant watch to watch season loving every episode
B00C0OLT6S,P. Jackson,3,This is yet another post apocalyptic dystopian view of the future with an interesting twist. Now we are still on Earth but it has been terraformed to look like somewhere else and we are cohabiting with a load of aliens.The main plots lines are very conventional and depend on people doing something stupid to maintain interest (which looses my interest) however there is a background plot which holds some promise. It is fairly obvious that the way this has been scripted allows it to stop at the end of season one or continue if someone continues to fund it.Characters are conventional with the occasional alien thrown in and the odd plot twist added so you do not get too complacent. This is not a cerebral experience and can be watched without too much effort. This is just OK for Sci Fi but these days true science fiction is rare and we must take what we can get. At least it is not full of zombies and vampires which is a relief.
B00C0OLT6S,Rich,5,Best Damn Si- Fi series in a long time!!! Can't wait to see what's going to happen next. Love the special effects and story line is excellent. Keep Nolan true to Lisa. Really loves his daughter. Love to see him out of the city though. Nolan and his daughter in the wild keeps you on your toe's. Never know what their going to do on come upon. Love the way the first season ended. Lots of room to take the story anywhere the writers want to.
B00C0OLT6S,Rob Lynn,5,Special effects are worth tuning in for alone. But; the storyline grows on you with each episode. Looking forward to continued viewing. Recommend to all; especially sci-fi buffs.
B00C0OLT6S,Rocking Rod,3,More of a drama than a Sci-Fi series but it's entertaining. Acting is credible but plot development is a little sketchy.
B00C0OLT6S,ROY,5,You can just about believe this could happen tomorrow and what the people would do help protect the planet.  Great series and where is the next season??
B00C0OLT6S,Stella Shahan "sastar27",5,THis is a great show about what if.  Some of the characters you can relate to and it's wonderful to follow.  You don't want to miss an episode or two but if you do it's easy to catch up.
B00C0OLT6S,THE G,5,Action packed Sci Fi thriller.  If you have not seen the show and you enjoy Sci Fi and action then you will not be disappointed with this thriller.
B00C0OLT6S,Vicki Fleming,5,Well written story lines and great characters.  Lots of action and fun to watch.  I'm watching the first season again as the second season has just started.
B00C0OLT6S,Wellred_2 "Carol",4,I love the series so I couldn't miss it. I cancelled my cable and love the little to no commercials!
B00C0OO294,Darlene,1,Story line sounded good but fifteen minutes into the first episode the show &#34;lost the plot&#34; and became just another soap opera with sex taking up way too much time.
B00C0OO294,Get Serious,3,All these lame Sci-Fi channel movies utilize identical  N*w W*rld Ord*r propaganda formulas:*A changed world after an alien attack apocalypse*Stupid costumes and alien makeup*CGI monsters*Lame 'saving mankind' storylines*Alien technological devices with lots and lots of blue light*Bizarre CGI landscapes and alien craft*Sex couplings just above soft porn (to make the ratings); plus black/white interracial sex and lesbian sex*Evil bad guys vs. the 'deboooner and swaaaave' hero*Mandatory cutsie-pie alien-choreographed dance tunesPluses include:  superior writing in providing decent storylines with adequate acting (direction)and well-thought-out scenarios. Music is well-designed. Apparently it's been contracted for a second season!
B00C0OO294,Inga Wuerges "FlyGirl",4,I loved Farscape and Rockne S. O'Bannon attempting at another great show.  I only watched the Pilot and was intregued but not wowed.  Hopefully it gets better into the season
B00C0OO294,Pacific Mitchell,5,I am a Sci-Fi buff and this show definitely fit that bill; lots of action and excitement. Can't wait for the next season
B00C0OO294,rgoodi,1,It was drivel so I quit watching. Really if there was a point to it all I would have hung on. It was a &#34;wanna be&#34; cross between the show Revolution and Falling Skies. But not nearly as good.
B00C0OO294,Tim Johnson,1,terrible - how do people even get money to film this PC garbage? why must i drone on about how bad this is just make the minimum word requirement?
B00C18NM54,Amazon Customer,5,This is one of my all time favorite shows!I love the insight I get into the science of cooking!Just wish there were more seasons available for streaming. :)
B00C18NM54,Steven Marrocco "smarro@earthlink.net",5,AB just keeps improving on his already-excellent style of cooking instruction.  What I REALLY like about these newer seasons is that he's taking more and more classics and giving them a facelift (or sometimes just showing us a better way to do it). He's still the best!
B00C18NM54,Todd Becker,5,The one thing which separates this show from any other &#34;cooking&#34; show is that Alton gives you the history of the dish or the ingredients used to make the dish. At the end of every show I can't help but feel a little smarter for having watched. And Alton is a naturally entertaining character. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves cooking shows.
B00C18VDZ0,Colleen Gregory,5,Please offer more of these with prime!!  Really enjoy them. Having a son that is moving over seas makes this extra good.
B00C18VDZ0,moptop64,5,I love this show and I am so glad amazon has it on Prime Instant. More reason now to dump my Comcast.
B00C18VOJK,Debra J. Meyer,4,Really like this show -- a tour of homes here and abroad.  Its nice to walk through the potential homes for people in so any different parts of the country.
B00C18VOJK,G.M.,4,I love watching this when I have 20 minutes to kill.  It's great to have it on Amazon without the commercials!
B00C18VOJK,Jessica Capizzo "undermyhat",5,I love this show...can we have more seasons please! I dont even need the new ones lol they could be from season one on!
B00C18VOJK,Melissa,5,love this show fun to watch some of the people looking for a house though are frustrating and annoying though ha what a fun job
B00C18VOJK,Michele Pankiw,5,I am hoping they put more shows on as my husband and I love watching it.  It is a great show and we enjoy it very much.
B00C18VOJK,Subq,5,We like to try and guess which house the people on the show will choose. Relaxing and fun show! Gives great ideas also for decorating!!
B00C18WT2Q,Alice,5,We really like this show it gives you ideas if you are planning to buy a house. We like seeing all the different houses.
B00C18WT2Q,F. Scott Fitzgerald "Hi Y'all!",5,Oh my!  The choices one has to make when purchasing a house!  I love watching the process and learning more!
B00C18WT2Q,Kelly Carlton,4,I always enjoy watching these but it's kind of a downer because I'm not the one moving to some exotic place!
B00C18X4HA,Colleen Gregory,5,I really enjoy getting inside different homes in other parts of the world. It's a good way to see the world and learn about home life. Please continue to offer these shows on Prime!
B00C18X4HA,Cynthia,5,I love this show as it allows my brain to wander and wish!  What if I wanted to live in another country????
B00C18X4HA,Edris Cooper,5,It is a treasure of travel and learning new life's as they begin!  Much culture is presented to learn. Extremely entertaining as to why these people move.
B00C18X4HA,Joyce A Campbell,5,So great to see the possibilities of living abroad.  Also helpful to see how much money would be needed depending on the country you choose.  I was surprised at how expensive it can be in many places.
B00C18X4HA,Mardee "Mardee",5,House Hunters International Season 32 is just as good as seasons 1 - 31.  If you love to travel it's a nice way to get a glimpse into other destination around the world!  I love HHI!  Hope this helps...
B00C18X4HA,N. Foley,5,Love looking at how the rest of the world lives. Interesting storylines and great locales. Enjoy every episode in the series.
B00C18X5GK,Adair,5,My wife and I enjoy watching this show to get an idea of our next must haves for a home. It's interesting to see how much house your money can get you in different areas.
B00C18X5GK,TL in SB,5,This show lets me go house hunting from the comfort of my home.  I get design and construction ideas.  The show takes us all around the country so we see the housing market in different communities.  This has become my go-to 1/2 hour show on Prime.
B00C193T74,B. Lyn,5,It's such a delight to visit places with such a fun guide.  She takes you to places you wouldn't ordinarily see on a tour and makes the visit so much fun.
B00C193T74,Katherine B. Brewton,5,Very enjoyable travel log.  Samantha really seems to convey the total picture of the places she visits.  I have picked up tips for the trips I plan to make.
B00C2MJARS,Karen Robinson "Ivy",5,Overall I loved the movie and Josephine was amazing! I couldn't stand the little sister character.. such a spoiled brat who should be locked in a cage.
B00C2MJARS,Paul "PJ",2,I rented this movie exam a fan of the leading man. I've always enjoyed his work. In this movie I didn't get involved and I don't think he got involved either. The movie was shot for lighting very little character development I did not seem to care about the story the characters or the cast.  I hope others find it more entertaining than I did!
B00C2UG118,A Everett,5,If you are into cosmology you can't pass this one up.  One of the best bps programs ever.  Just wish it was longer.
B00C2UG118,Boricua,2,After a time of see this serie i wonder what happens with the subtitles . Is no a bad serie of the universe but the millions of people who are deafmute will no apreciate.
B00C2UG118,CatLoraine,5,This has excellent digital graphics and narration. Cosmic Journeys by Thomas Lucas fills in and updates the cosmology previously covered in similar videos.
B00C2UG118,Ixias,4,Enjoyed the series. The narrator was professional and enjoyable to listen to. They made good use of animation to explain complex concepts. Suitable for children.
B00C2UG118,Mike Hunt,3,Good not great narrorater very mono tone. I suggest you search for agenda 21 or mk ultra. I T M
B00C2UG118,Ronald Dillenburg "Ron D",4,Easy to watch and enjoy educational material about astronomy in short (less than half hour) increments. Very well done and not out of date.
B00C2UG118,Ronald L. Montes "Ron The Tech",4,The graphics are great and the message is easily understood.  The graphics are beautiful and the story is down to Earth.
B00C35BIHY,C. Sawyer,5,How Robert Irvine turns an impossible situation into a profit is amazing.  He's a hard task master which is what the owners need.  He tells the truth and doesn't sugar coat it.  It is fun to watch the transformation.
B00C35BIHY,Joan M. Poole,5,Don't know how Robert Irvine doesn't wind up with a heart attach.  The joys he picks are really challenging and then the only get worse.  He's really great to watch and each time he shows some really nice recipes that I will probably try to duplicate.
B00C35F1G8,C. Sawyer,5,Love to watch Robert Irvine change a failing restaurant into a great one.  He may be painfully honest but the owners really need that.
B00C35F1G8,Joan M. Poole,5,Really interesting to watch him transform dive restaurants into elegant dining experiences.  His cooking is great and he goes from simple to a very high scale according to the restaurants needs.
B00C35F1G8,Kimberlily,5,I love this guy! What he says goes because you can tell he loves what he does. His body is nice for an older guy too. Good to see the restaurant transformation s.
B00C35R67K,Cynthia,4,Has a lot of good information for first time homebuyers.  The characters are interesting too.  Wish they had this show before I bought my home.
B00C35R67K,shopalot,2,Improve the show by-only picking peeps who will actually BUY a house-show home after buyers have improved it
B00C35SF3Y,Alice,5,We really like this show because it gives you ideas how you can renovate yourself. We ill continue to watch the show..
B00C35SF3Y,TL in SB,2,I would not recommend this show.  It's all about her and her problems.  I got weary of hearing about her problems while the renovation was being done.  I wanted to hear discussion of the project.
B00C361C24,Edris Cooper,5,The hostess Sabrina and her woodworking partner are so great working together.  Watching the shopping at discount stores versus the high end.....is amazing!  Great ideas to be had!
B00C361C24,Elizabeth Brancato,4,This show is fun and is interesting to see how many expensive furnishings can be approximated for much less money.
B00C361C24,L. Robinson,5,I don't get the HGTV channel so it was nice to watch it through Amazon.  It's fun to watch Sabrina replace expensive items with bargain finds.
B00C361C24,TL in SB,5,The host and her helper are both very appealing people and they tackle real life projects.  The first design uses extremely expensive features.  Then they recreate the room within a realistic budget.  It's fun to watch and get ideas.  Some of the do it yourself projects work and others don't.  But all of the ideas are interesting and doable.
B00C36TYYM,Charity1230 "Charity",5,Love any and all of his shows. He is very funny and entertaining.  I also like the destinations and commentary.
B00C36TYYM,Dwight,3,It didn't show things or places that I wanted to see but it showed me something I didn't know about - the connection between the otherwise inexplicable popularity of tepid tomato soup with bland macaroni and the fondness and gratitude for the American soldiers in their midst many decades earlier.
B00C36TYYM,Erin "sneimraej",5,Now the Amsterdam episode absolutely sucks (in my opinion) but all the rest of them are fantastic.  I can watch episodes of The Layover over and over again
B00C36TYYM,Larry M. Wright II,4,Pro: I love doing short trips. Needed his kind of insight for some things. Asia and UK best episodes. Hope he does second season.Con: had to loose a star for first episode of New York. Way too dark and lost.
B00C36TYYM,lee,4,I Love all Anthony bourdain shows. There are definitely places that I w pi ls like to stop by next time I go to different cities he visits
B00C3WI6WM,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,4,James Mc Avoy is one of those actors that with each films he makes he just gets more and more likeable. the acting is great the action is fantastic.
B00C3WI6WM,David "Black Widow 2014",2,Although James Mcavoy is an awesome actor I found this movie pretty boring. the story dragged the plot kind of stunk. the movie did not get exciting until the last ten minutes of the movie then it just stopped with James's character putting his hands behind his head. I won't go into anymore detail so I won't ruin the movie for who wants to watch it. but all I can say is that I found it dull. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't
B00C58CP0I,A. Coleman "A. Mom",5,I love the crazy drama. I have been watching from day one. I will continue watching as long as the show comes on!
B00C58CP0I,Amy M. Peterson,3,This show is pretty terrible but for some reason I watch ever single season. I guess its just a pretty entertaining guilty pleasure.
B00C58CP0I,Bookworm4,4,Just like the RHOBH I enjoy this show as it brings back memories of living there. NYC girl at heart but still very much miss CA as being there was much more recent. I hope they never get rid of Vicky. As for Lydia I wish she and her husband would have sent me the magazines I ordered from their company. She's left the show to work on her brand? It might be a start to actually deliver on your products with out customers having to report claims through PayPal etc. and zero communications from their Beverly Hills lifestyle Magazine. Just a thought.
B00C58CP0I,Jac1528,5,This show is totally my guilty pleasure! I am addicted! Lol it's getting a little old with the same fights but we'll see what happens
B00C58CP0I,Jdances "bdancer",3,Maybe they should get all new housewives in O County.  I did watch the full season plus the reunion show but it was kind of yawny. It was a little to &#34;mean girls&#34; for me this year.  The folks that are not coming back should stay and some of the ones returning should leave.
B00C58CP0I,RML,2,These &#34;Housewives&#34; series used to be somewhat entertaining but the &#34;players&#34; are just so self-involved the show has become painful to watch.
B00C58CP0I,Vyctorya,4,I've seen only a handful of episodes and they aren't so bad.  My favorite is the Real Housewives of Beverly HIlls.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B00C58QYXM,BK Perea,4,This is nothing more than what is says &#34;10 minute preview&#34;. Good in that it allows one to see if this is what they want to see.
B00C5K6Z48,Cathy,5,My son loves George...actually learns quite alot of things from this show...great for little tykes...wish there were more though. He watches them over and over again...
B00C5K6Z48,Chalupa,5,Captures the attention of a 2 year old and covers so many different topics. Definitely a favorite in our house!
B00C5K6Z48,Claudine,5,We love Curious George. It's a adorable show that my son loves to watch. No violence. Just a little mischief!
B00C5K6Z48,John Johnson,5,My son and daughter love the Curious George series and I'm surprised to say I learn a lot from it myself. Wonderful clean fun for the whole family...
B00C5K6Z48,J-Squared,5,my 1 yr old's favorite tv show.  there isn't much of a learning aspect to the show or songs but its colorful and entertaining
B00C5LHHYO,Ron Baker,3,I thought the actor and director did as well as they could with the inherently limited subject material. Freaky situation to be in. The movie does a good job of putting the viewer in the &#34;what would I do&#34; mode.
B00C5LHHYO,Stephen Holley,4,I woindered how I would have reacted all through the movie. I liked the movie it was very thought provoking.
B00C5O60PS,Amazon Customer,5,My dino daughter loves this show. At two years old this is one of her favorite shows! She is absolutely fixated with dinosaurs right now and this fits in right with all the other dino activities she loves.
B00C5O60PS,Barbara J. Mcdermott,5,This kept my 3 year old nephew entertained. He loves dinosaurs and loved how the good guys confronted the &#34;monsters&#34; and overcome their fear.
B00C5O60PS,D. M. Garland,4,This is a fine program for a toddler.  It's a bit too sugary for my six year old but my three year old enjoys it.
B00C5O60PS,eric matheny,3,With the land before time being an old favorite of mine as a kid I figured I couldn't go wrong getting this for my toddler and baby to watch they love the dinosaurs
B00C5O60PS,mari franks,5,We loved watching this with our five year old son. It is funny and an easy way to keep him busy while we are out.
B00C5O60PS,penlight,2,If you want something fun and educational for the kids. I strongly recommend curious George instead which is free on prime.Another fun series is avatar airbender.This one is boring and poorly put together in comparison. Even my dinosaur crazy kid doesn't really get into it.
B00C5O60PS,romansjoy,5,My 3 year old great granddaughter loves this show and watches it on the Kindle before bed.  She never seems to get tired of it.
B00C6C96UK,bob is dead,5,Awsome
B00C6C96UK,Gerbear,4,This may not be the best zombie movie but it is pretty damn good. The characters are fun and the movie moves along at a nice click. If you are looking for a fun distraction this will do.
B00C70XZJE,atlee,5,Outstanding in all regards. Quietly evocative of the terror of those times.  I wish there were a second season.
B00C70XZJE,Belinda Roman,2,I hoped this would be interesting but it was simply too low-budget for the idea of pre-WWII spies in Warsaw.
B00C70XZJE,Duncan Brown,4,Something I did not know about WW2. The acting was OK. The scenery was marvelous. This is worth a watch.
B00C70XZJE,KD Josh,5,What more do I really need to say.  He's a brilliant actor and I see him in anything he does.
B00C70XZJE,Marie Silverman "nysefox",5,Outstanding series! Subtle and well executed. The cast is first rate. This is not some 'great flaming romance' against a backdrop of war...............this is the story of how it probably was in Europe just before WWII. The chess game played by Russia and Germany against the rest of Europe. Highly recommend.
B00C70XZJE,Progressive Penguin "Progpen",5,I have enjoyed this story so far.  Very suspenseful and it doesn't over-romanticize.  David Tennant is great in this series.
B00C7KXUOE,Amazon Customer,4,This rendition is of our  Dr Hannibal needs your gull attention.  I watched two shows just to be sure that I didn't like it.  Then I watched those same shows again on my iPad and with the improved sound quality I started to understand the direction and story line.  I had to read Poe several times to understand his intent and direction.  I believe we are seeing a new effort in TV presentation here.  Very good writing and direction.  It is a taste to be acquired.
B00C7KXUOE,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,Hannibal is an amazin and intense thriller full of awesome and creepy music and imagery. Truly a fan couldnt ask for more than this.
B00C7KXUOE,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,1,I was intrigued by the dramatization of the series at the movie theatre but this TV episode is just awful. I have had enough. Nothing further need be said!
B00C7KXUOE,Booker,4,I gave a 3 star rating to hannibal because it was apealing and interestingThere was a intriguing dynamic to the showI would recommend it to family and friends
B00C7KXUOE,Carolyn D. Smith,4,This is a very dark series with vivid crime scenes of grisly murders.  Not for the faint of heart.  Hugh Dancy is a super actor who does an excellent job of portraying a very sensitive very broken FBI agent.  Hannibal is bonechilling.  Very good series with a lot of plot twists.
B00C7KXUOE,Carolyn Skinner08,4,I like history and the scienery.  This was a good story and could have been based on fact or not
B00C7KXUOE,chikiBABY,5,Love first season. I can't wait for the second AND future seasons. Hannibal is a Real BASTARD!  I am HOOKED!
B00C7KXUOE,CLAUDE H TOWNSEND JR,1,What type of sick mind can think up this type of serial killer garbage...probably the type who should be locked up
B00C7KXUOE,Crazyanimegyrl,5,[NO SPOILERS]I enjoyed the heck out of Hannibal.  You want to view a Psychological Thriller?  THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!  The characters were outstanding.  Had me from the first episode to the last and wanted to shed some tears that the season ended.Totally recommend this series.  You will not be disappointed.  Kudos to NBC for airing this type of series (shocking of them wasn't it?).  Can't wait for S2. It looks like it's going to be explosive from the way the last episode ended.
B00C7KXUOE,Crzyoldone,5,This is like a Living Dead counterpart to TWD. The characters are emotionless but the stories still grab you. It is how I imagine intellectuals would handle the grotesque and distance themselves from the emotional impact of what Hannibal does. I can't wait till I each new episode
B00C7KXUOE,Devin Gilson,4,Excellent show. Offers  revealing incite into the beginnings (per-Silence of the Lambs). This was the first time I had been able to watch the show & was pleasantly suprised it is a bit gory but within limits and the realism adds to the show.
B00C7KXUOE,Dog Friendly,4,I really couldn't see this as the basis for a television series.  I was wrong.  It's visually beautiful and very well done.
B00C7KXUOE,donna l. krause,5,The quality of the acting is outstanding! I've seen Madds M. In several subtitled film and have been a fan for years. I especially loved him in after the wedding  and adam's apples. A great supporting cast and grizzly cases make it a fun and exciting series.
B00C7KXUOE,ENH1142,5,Well crafted show. I love the cinematography and acting. I can't wait to watch season two. Hurry up and put it on Prime!
B00C7KXUOE,ES,3,The story line is good for awhile but then becomes tiresome.  Mikkelson is very good as Lecter.  Dancy is good but sometimes not convincing.  Fishburne is not at all convincing.  Anderson is robotic in her role.  The stories are meant to be reflections of evil and depravity and generally succeed.  It will be hard to maintain a series based on a new serial killer each week.  It would be better to have story arcs of 3-4 episodes.  I don't believe the series will last beyond two seasons.
B00C7KXUOE,Fawn Perry,5,This show is amazing.  Can't wait to see season 2. One of the most brutal and visually stunning shows around.
B00C7KXUOE,Here in ocean city "Melissa",5,Great acting awesome story etc. I find it funny as well as tricky all at the same time. The more I watch the more I discover. Amazing story line and cannot wait for season 2. I find it a step above dexter because it was produced with less awkward scenes and more artistically written like a modern day Hitchcock mystery.
B00C7KXUOE,Ingie,5,This show keeps me on my toes and it is a delight to watch. I love how the name of the title is always fitting with what Hannibal or someone is serviung as food or how the situation can be perceived. Excellent show!
B00C7KXUOE,jim jones,4,Little slow at first I can see I will be drawn into watching all the epic. l love these kind of horror show
B00C7KXUOE,Joyce A. Burns "ACTIVE SENIOR",5,great acting and story.  very intense and full of suspense and mystery.  wish will good luck in season two.  laurence fishburne is as always just plain great.
B00C7KXUOE,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,5,GREAT SHOWCAN NOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT .. I WAS GLUED TO THE TV FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME .. LOVED IT
B00C7KXUOE,Lydia Buitron,5,Awesome that it took off from Red Dragon. Wish there was more. Could have had a better ending. The end.
B00C7KXUOE,Mark D. Allison,4,Liked it a lot but not finished watching whole series...might get five stars yet! Recommend it though! For a really invigorating hunger -free mealtime..(snicker)
B00C7KXUOE,mark two &#34;Douggie&#34; "darwinist",4,Hannibal himself is played in a very studied emotional way with a believable sense of menace just below the surface. The plot line is just a bit loose and although the series has a great deal of talent the script does not take full advantage. I think this will be eventually corrected in season 2.
B00C7KXUOE,Mark Wolfe,4,Wish I had started watching in the beginning. Now I am marathoning and dreading when the episodes runout. What then?
B00C7KXUOE,Mike Hunt,1,Hey america this is the dumbing down you demand. This show is complete trash. Just glorifies murder and cannibalism. Its not clever or unique and it is repulsive you will love it.
B00C7KXUOE,patricia hanerfeld,4,my whole family watches hannibal. there's nothing to dislike. watch it and you will be a fan too.  good tv
B00C7KXUOE,Patscats,4,This series is well written and acted. It is very dark both in story and lighting so be prepared for some difficult story lines. If you like &#34;The Killing&#34; I think you will like this series as well.
B00C7KXUOE,Spike,5,Hannibal is one of those shows that start off great and just gets better every episode.  I was just re-watching and thinking that Mads Mikkelsen is so good that I can't imagine him having to audition for parts.  What's amazing is the show is so nail biting and the season ends on it's head...and then Season 2 just blows season 1 out of the water.
B00C7KXUOE,Steamer,4,I was surprised to find out this show is actually on NBC. It is more like from a cable network.I love the show!
B00C7KXUOE,Steve,5,If you are a fan of the Thomas Harris books and the movie versions of Silence of the Lamb and Red Dragon you are in for a treat with this TV remake. If you never saw the movies or read the books then you are in for a greart ride if you like this genre.
B00C7KXUOE,swims2me,4,This show is creepy fun! It reminds me of the great movies made over a decade ago. I really enjoy Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelson's  performances.
B00C7KXUOE,techie mike,4,I really enjoy this show.  Hannibal is awesome and Hugh Dancey is gorgeous! I would love for him to have a show of his own!
B00C7KXUOE,Terry,4,This is a much better than average thriller for. Network tV. It's worth watching if the Hannibal stioies intrigue you. You won't find the Hannibal character disappointing .
B00C7KXUOE,Tiffany Ann Conroy Moore "TACM",5,All I can say is that I am salivating for Season 2!!! This is a very fine program. Be prepared for gore.
B00C7KXUOE,Tim O'Brien,5,Combined great artistic and interesting photography with a terrific storyline and the actor who plays the crazed detective is superb.
B00C7KXUOE,toadknocker,5,This program is a bit like Dexter mixed with some Sopranos mixed in.  Each story has a murder and someone to get caught along with the evil Hannibal pulling the strings and keeping it all going.  Fun to watch!
B00C7POSC2,Amazon Customer,5,This was a wonderful treat of a movie. The characters develop at a quick pace and in somewhat realistic manners which really make the movie enjoyable. The main character is quirky and has a lot of depth.
B00C7POSC2,sonya "i am a fashionista nerd&#62; I am stud...,5,this is a true gem of a movie! The actor Lou taylor Pucci aka Luke was amazing! I have seen many a movie and documentary on autism but this gives us hope. I know this character is pretty much a shy typical socially stunted young man. Who gets motivated literally no pun intended. He is a beautiful young man and plays his disability beautifully. Seth's character [zack] a bit harsh the first time I saw it but then I realized he's screwed up too. {not just an ass} Zack needed Luke more than vice versa. I laughed quite a bit which was nice. Even the supporting roles of family and friends didn't deter my loving of the film. enough said about that! I titled my review The story of.. we each can fill in the blanks. This film did and it inspired me to get my s...t together [be a woman though]! Hail Luke ! Hmmmm Biblical hmmmmmm! lol
B00C9O3C0U,B. Edmondson,5,Great season so far.  It has the same captains from last year so you can keep track of the same crews and see how the next year has gone for them.  Nice they suck with some of the captains that changed boats from last year to this year as well.
B00C9O3C0U,Fred D. Lewis "Derf8me",5,There is something refreshing about seeing a Captain in command of a boat and free to roam the sea. And the crab fishing provides the tension and suspense since it is the fishing that pays the bills.The emotional ups and downs are palpable. The crew doesn't get paid if they don't catch the crab.
B00C9O3C0U,pam,2,I have watched and loved DC from the beginning but just as some of the fisherman I have grown pretty tired of it and am retiring from watching it Since the Cornelia Marie is gone things seemed to have gone downhill from there with the story lines.  I have watched faithfully until the last 2 years though.  Sad about it!
B00C9O3C0U,S. Thiel "Sanpan",5,It gets better and better each season.  A few surprises this season that were unexpected.  Never a dull moment.  The life on a crab boat is always so full of tension.
B00CB6F1QO,Amazon Customer,4,Great concept and writing.  Animation was good the CGI will make this kids program non stoppable. Love the idea of incorporating a little science into the fun.  A little hard for an older adult to suspend disbelief to this extent but will not be difficult for a child.
B00CB6F1QO,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",5,My son loved this show it was hard to get him to watch the other originals to see if he liked them. He likes the science part of the show mostly as there are few left for kids and he is stuck watching reruns of The Magic School Bus and Bill Nigh the Science Guy. My Son is 5 so these are "new" to him.
B00CB6F1QO,Britney,5,I have a six year old daughter who skipped kindergarten and is very advanced. I minimize tv time but when she does watch it is hard to find something new for her. I don't want tv that using educational and would not allow her to watch shows such as sponge Bob. This show is more advanced starring older kids but still educational. It is not a teenage disney show that six year olds are watching and being negatively influenced by. This show is great. Two smart kids using science and creating a world around them with robots and cool tools. Boys would love it but my daughter was thrilled with it.
B00CB6F1QO,Catherine M. Edwards,5,My young granddaughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the preview and pilot episodes.  She instantly identified with the characters and is quite disappointed that there aren't more episodes available.What a terrific concept and delivery method! Come on Amazon! More episodes -- get this series on the road!
B00CB6F1QO,ERB,5,I would see this show appealing to a wide audience and it has a new idea about presenting learning opportunities. I like the premise and its very visually appealing. All ages could find it interesting and easy to watch..
B00CB6F1QO,ewhitney,3,I love the concept but we like it better animated. I think an animated series is more suited for preschoolers.
B00CB6F1QO,IparkJons,3,This could be a very good and enjoyable show. My daughter liked it. I would like to see a full live action episode though.
B00CB6F1QO,M56,5,This is a refreshing concept for older kid shows which is far and in between nowadays.  I see great potentials with this show but would have to say characters development would be an important aspect.  Could not tell from the short preview.  The boy narrating the story is cute and bubbly but the girl actor can use more personality and facial expression.  Robots and the bird are great additions to the cast.
B00CB6F1QO,Meega,4,My kids 8-11 liked this and thought it was cute. They said they would watch this show again. The ending was the only part they questioned and they did ask for more science experiment s.
B00CB6F1QO,Ron Baker,3,I like the idea of showing children that science can be cool. Up the detail of the science and keep the cuteness. A tad bit more personality for Anne would be welcome.
B00CB6F1QO,T. Pillers,5,I think this could be a big hit. we always need top quality children's shows that inspire and teach in a fun and exciting way. i also like that the show will have it's own web page. Could be the best idea in children's programing since Sesame Street.
B00CB6N4LS,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",5,I find it interesting that they were successful in making a show about math actually entertaining. My son liked it and there are no math shows that I know of so I glad this is around for and truly hope it stays.
B00CB6N4LS,Britney,4,My six year old daughter and three year old son both loved this. My son says "this one's for boys too". The music was great as well as the problem solving. I loved the brother sister relationship. I loved the girl solving math and enjoying being smart. My only disappointment was the negative behavior.  The villain Victor vector was mean but also the two main characters acted out. The boy said "sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do" after misbehaving and the girl did a happy dance after calling out Victor vector. I hate showing my kids shows with this kind of mean negative behavior because I feel like they learn just as much about the negative behavior as they do the positive. Of the couple of shows they watched they prefer this one. That could also be due to the fact that it was completely animated and the others were still in the works so minus these couple of negative lines the show has huge potential.
B00CB6N4LS,David Albright,3,It was pretty good show.  The math was educational.  Story line was ok.  I might have my kids watch it if there wasn't something else more educational on.
B00CB6N4LS,ewhitney,3,Its a cute learning show for my daughter but it isn't something I would sit down and watch with her.
B00CB6N4LS,IparkJons,5,This was mine and my daughter's favorite of the kid's show. It's the only one the really held our attention. I like the math as well.
B00CB6N4LS,Kim D. Gage,5,I liked the show! It reminded me of the good holism shows I use to watch when I was a child. Not sure where on of the reviewers got the racial overtone from but I guess everyone is entitled to how they feel. I for one feel that this is a good educational and entertaining show and I would be willing to let my kids watch it. Good job amazon!
B00CB6N4LS,Lisa "boston's biggest baked bean",5,I loved the pet bunny mystery!  I think kids will love this show and they have fun with math at the same time.
B00CB6N4LS,Meega,3,My kids ages 8-11 thought it was cute but too young for them. They would like to see some harder mysteries or different math problems.  They didn't think Victor vector was a realistic villain.  But they did want to know if there were more episodes.
B00CB6N4LS,Richard Siegmeister,3,We live in an apartment complex in the Bronx and I think this is the first kids show I have seen where the characters live in an apartment.  Besides liking the setting my 7 year old son liked the characters and the music.  He also liked that they solve a mystery.  He said he would watch another episode if it was available.
B00CB6NINM,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",5,The message here is a reminder of the muppet babies cartoon from the 80's. Good to see the Jim Henson company still has is even this many yrs after the death of Jim Henson. My 5 yr old liked it well enough and I was remindered of Fragglerock so win win.
B00CB6NINM,ERB,4,Hard to tell how it would really look in final production but would probably appeal to kids. Theme song is a bit much. Cute idea.
B00CB6NINM,ewhitney,3,I am letting my 2 1/2 year old watch all the pilots and this one she just did not get into .if its made with puppets maybe she'll be more interested.
B00CB6NINM,M56,2,The dog puppet is not as cute as the other Jim Henson's puppets and the story was not original or captivating.  My 4 yr old loves the Pajanimals but lost interest less than 5 minutes into the pilot episode.  The graphic of the hand drawings is not great either and that could be another reason why she lost interest so quickly.  Would be better had at least half of the pilot is done with the puppet/animation (this comment also applies to all the children animation pilots).  Need some work on several aspects for this show to work for us.
B00CB6NINM,xloner12,5,My daughter 2 and son younger both watched this and love doggies. They were already singing along with the opening theme. At the end my daughter keep asking for more. We hope to see more of teeny tiny dogs.
B00CB6PDSA,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",5,I can see myself tiring of this show but my 5 yr old likes it so my rating is reflecting his thought's and comments as it is directed at his age group. I like that the show is nonviolent and puts positive values on a younger group unlike most shows. The adventure aspect is reminiscent of shows like Dora the Explorer and I genuinely think that the younger children will absolutely love this show.
B00CB6PDSA,B. Kimball,5,Best one out of all the choices. Very up beat. I know my daughter and some nieces would love this show.
B00CB6PDSA,David Albright,5,Enjoyed the OZ theme and the kids enjoyed watching it.  I wish it was a little more educational.  But it was cute and was very positive.  I wouldn't have any problems with my kids watching the show.
B00CB6PDSA,ENH1142,4,Love the adventures in OZ and the characters. Great for young kids under 6 with a learning aspect. Very sweet.
B00CB6PDSA,T. Pillers,4,I think that this would be a good positive and entertaining show for kids. The CGI that they were able to get done for this was very good. Creative problem solving seems to be the theme here and it's a good one to teach.
B00CB6PDSA,xloner12,5,Both my kids were liking this show. They danced during the music and enjoyed it even with most of being story boards. I'm pretty sure they would love it as a series as they didn't move away once. I also thought the show was pretty good for a kid show.
B00CB6SU5I,Alyce Wilson,4,My 3-year-old liked this one a lot: from the colorful characters to the message about the value of art. He wants to see more of this!
B00CB6SU5I,Amazon Customer,5,My daughter loves this show! We have been doing the projects she sees in the show.
B00CB6SU5I,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",5,If you ignore the animation this is actually pretty entertaining. My 5 yr old likes the music and the art creation aspect of the show.
B00CB6SU5I,C. Martinez,3,I love the fact it introduces different art forms to children and allows for ctafts but i think it is a show older children  will enjoy(4&up)why it might lose the attention span of younger ones. I liked thw concept but i got bored wayching it.
B00CB6SU5I,David Albright,3,It was ok.  It had some educational value relating to different types of art.  I would probably let my kids watch it but probably not my first choice
B00CB6SU5I,Dental hygienist mom,5,Our three year old loves this show. It leaves her wanting to try the different  arts and crafts shown on the show.
B00CB6SU5I,lpearson,5,I have a 9 year old and 3 year old who loved this series. Both girls could not wait to watch episode after episode. This is the first time I have seen these girls be still that long ever! Great way to present different types of art to young ones.
B00CB6SU5I,pametgirl,5,So may good ideas and inspiration for parents and kids...Love it as I am an artist and love to make projects with kids....Bravo
B00CB6SU5I,SavvyShopper,5,Neat show!  Our 6 yr old loves the craft making.
B00CB6SU5I,T. Pillers,5,great show for early art education. I really liked how they paired learning about classic art and an easy to do art project which also connects to the painting featured. I really think this will be a good creative motivator for young children.
B00CBKUWKA,John E. Scott,5,These guys do up ghost hunting in a very Southern way. At first I thought they were going to be too casual about their ghost hunting.Bunch of &#34;good old boys&#34; looking for ghosts. But these guys truly get down to business when investigating.
B00CBLGJY2,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",3,I best I can sum this up is that its about an ADD fox. Most parents by now are shaking their heads but I didnt get it. It failed to keep my attention but my 5 yr old was smitten with this. He said it deserves 5 stars I said 1 star so we compromised.
B00CBLGJY2,Bzlindaman,5,Awesome stop motion animation makes this unique compared to the other pilots. So long as this is a completely done that way this is a winner .
B00CBLGJY2,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",5,The storyline is great and they always keep at something until they figure it out. My son loves it and wants a clubhouse like figs home.
B00CBLGJY2,Dental hygienist mom,5,Our three year old loves this program! The stories are simple problem solvers and the characters are very cute! We hope there will be a season two.
B00CBLGJY2,ENH1142,3,The stop motion and animation is really beautiful but the story wasn't as intriguing or as compelling as some of the other shows up here. I was not drawn to a particular character and only the visuals kept me interested.
B00CBLGJY2,Holly,5,Absolutely LOVE this show. My little one loves this show! I'm already looking for toys and action figures for my little one to play with!!!
B00CBLGJY2,Jenny K Carney,5,I wish there were more episodes. My 3 year old loves the show. The music episode is our favorite! Thx
B00CBLGJY2,M56,5,Really like how the educational lessons are weaved into the story and how they are reinforced without coming across forced or contrite.  And very cute characters.  The best of all children pilots.  Would like to see more episodes!
B00CBLGJY2,Ms. Beatriz O. Resendez,5,This is the perfect show for children!!!! I love it!!! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE FOR CHILDREN TO WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CBLGJY2,Richard Siegmeister,4,I loved the look of the show and the characters were very sweet.  I would be happy to have my kids watch this
B00CBLGJY2,T. Pillers,4,good science themed show for preschoolers and K-1st graders. I did think the voice acting could be worked on a little. Hope it gets picked up.
B00CBNO8MK,Alliee,4,Pretty funny pilot --  grinned most of the time and laughed out loud the rest of the time.  Reminded me of my old favorite Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- kick evil 's butt and make it funny!
B00CBNO8MK,Amazon Customer,4,Random but funny. I enjoyed the 2 characters even if it was crude. You would like it if you watch cartoon network at night
B00CBNO8MK,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",3,Honestly I almost passed on watching this one and in some ways wish that I had. This is obviously aimed at women and I think they were successful in finding their target audience as only the women in our household liked this show. I thought it was really corny and reminded me of a mix of Daria and South Park. The stereotype comedy is there but I personally didn't like it. I saw people that I know in these characters and that's not a good thing just annoying.
B00CBNO8MK,Amazon Customer "no relation 2 sylvia",5,I've watched a bunch of the Amazon Prime Pilots and this was by far the best! Haven't laughed that hard out loud in a long time.
B00CBNO8MK,Carlton L. Winston,2,It just isn't a show for me. I could barely finish it. This may be a show that others enjoy.
B00CBNO8MK,ChasNCenTx,3,That's what three stars means.  I'm just being nice.  It was trying too hard to be hip and happenin' yada yada....  That's in my humble opinion.  Needs a good editor to tighten up the story.  Is about livn' in the &#34;hood&#34;? or chasing ghosts and such?  Move a bit more one way or the other.
B00CBNO8MK,ClearBucket,1,I did not like this at all. I don't really like the modern adult cartoon comedies and this is just as bad or worse than the rest.
B00CBNO8MK,destiny 3,5,I really enjoyed the show. It made me laugh many times and it is just the right length. I hope it gets a full season.
B00CBNO8MK,E. Bailey,5,This show is fresh and original. It's so quotable. We've been saying "spider please" for days after watching it. Certainly a lot of people would like to posts clips to social networking sites. Make that possible please.
B00CBNO8MK,ENH1142,2,The two leads are a bit obnoxious. The pilot overall wasn't that interesting and I do not believe I would watch this series.
B00CBNO8MK,Evansville Jill,4,Hilarious!I love the gritty nature of this animated series. The writing is wonderful and the character voices are genius.
B00CBNO8MK,HillBuzz dot ORG "HillBuzz dot ORG",5,This was really funny. It's like one part Buffy the Vampire Slayer and one part BAPS with Halle Berry.  Would make a fun series because they could have a different monster every week.
B00CBNO8MK,Hook2000iam,3,Better than most the Amazon Crap Shows. None should be made into series. This one was at least half amusing.
B00CBNO8MK,JH,5,Seriously great show...really love Kristen Schaal and I think this is yet another project of hers which has been well-chosen. Gimme more!
B00CBNO8MK,Justin Murphy,3,Whoever thought two valley girl/ghetto types would ever be saving the world demons conjured from hell? I sure didn't and it's quite a different that I found funny while watching this pilot. I hope to see what happens next with this demon running for Mayor!
B00CBNO8MK,Kathleen M Thomas,4,IT was pretty funny. I laughed out loud a few times. I will look forward to watching this show again.
B00CBNO8MK,Keanon Pete,5,OK sorry but this was hilarious. Heehee. Drew Droege as Crystal Skull was beyond hilarious!!! I didn't realize it was him until the end credits. More please! #Love #DrewDroegeRocks!
B00CBNO8MK,Mark,5,This is hilarious. Has a Archer-ish vibe to it. I hope there are more episodes of this in the future. Very funny.
B00CBNO8MK,Marlon,3,Fun animated pilot not sure how long a series like this will hold my attention. Stereotype humor. No surprises in the storyline.
B00CBNO8MK,Matt Cook,2,became quickly bored with the episode and did not even finish watching.  disposable characters which did not generate any feeling of attachment
B00CBNO8MK,peliculafan,5,The dialogue is absolutely brilliant in this animated spoof series of all the pseudoscience of which you've ever heard. Bringing the supposedly powerful mysteries of the past into the banality of the present is genius.
B00CBNO8MK,repple321,5,Lots of laughs.  Very funny setting in the mall.  Characters are really likable.  Love the constant chuckles throughout.  I don't usually watch animated series.  I'll watch this one though.  The whole premise just makes me laugh.
B00CBNO8MK,Robert Lunte "Author of The Four Pillars of S...,5,I liked it. It was funny and I would probably be watching the entire series right now. Wish they would produce more.  Seems it kinda just died on the vine and didn't push forward?  Too bad...
B00CBNO8MK,Samantha Penigar,5,Really looking forward to more.  It was very funny and I have watched it several times already.  It is one I'll watch again.
B00CBNO8MK,S. Highley "Mr. Frugality",1,I can't imagine anybody would think this has ANY redeeming qualities.  Not smart.  Not funny. Not clever.  Not entertaining.  Not gonna get made!
B00CBNO8MK,T. Pillers,4,Being a fan of sci-fi I would watch this show if you produce it. It would diffidently bring in fans of adult swim.
B00CBNOBYU,A-2-Z Enterprise,2,This was not very entertaining. I was done before the show was. Anybody giving this more than 3 stars must be stoned.
B00CBNOBYU,Amazon Customer "D.F.",4,Unique in its combination. Some of the melodies are a little weak but fun overall. Good acting from the young cast. Again a unique show. Thanks Amazon for such great new material to watch.
B00CBNOBYU,Amazon Customer,1,Terrible show and I don't know why they added the music. Music is like adding something bad to something worse.
B00CBNOBYU,Andre Wiggins,1,This was a waste of time. Not only was the premise tiresome but also the musical bits. None of the characters was interesting. This is not a show I'd want to see as a series. Awful!
B00CBNOBYU,Brian Reisman,4,I love the show... I just couldn't stop laughing... most of the music was pretty good too. This is the kind of show that would keep my Amazon Prime membership intact.
B00CBNOBYU,B. S. Diederich "trashartist",2,I do like musicals but I wasn't real thrilled with this and watched 20 minutes before I moved on to something more interesting. I thought the introductory songs lingered on far too long (except for the coughing part--most humorous!). Probably should of watched the entire thing before I ranked this; it oould of been a decent show---maybe clip each solo so they are are not so lengthy...
B00CBNOBYU,B. Smith,1,Missed opportunity to be really good. I always like to learn something about the inside of an industry when I watch something like this. Nothing presented itself. The concept was good but the delivery was pretty yoki.
B00CBNOBYU,Corvin Adkins "maguscorvin",4,I felt like this show was a good starter but definitely needed a bit more polish.  Another episode to follow would more than likely do the trick.  Strangely enough I felt the music was not bad but if they pushed the boundaries a little more (sound almost like Glee) they would make more impact with their 'musical' moments.  It is cute and at times witty.  Looking forward for more episodes to see how it evolves and hopefully progresses.
B00CBNOBYU,devkar9700,1,Is this an updated version of Ugly Betty??  It sure has the look of that show.  I dislike all the characters.  I would never watch this show again.  This is 25 minutes I will never ever...get back!
B00CBNOBYU,E. Easley "EZ Truth",4,Loved the songs and story line is interesting.  I am looking forward to seeing more. Hopefully it gets enough approval to keep going.
B00CBNOBYU,Elizabeth Ansley,1,Now I know why I had never heard of this maybe the dumbest story line ah is there even a story line? And shame on great actors doing this third rate show
B00CBNOBYU,HeMeGrrrr,1,This wanna-be glee in the workplace is not worth your time. Very disappointed. Expected more from BeBe. Terrible stereo-types. An insult to music lover's ears.
B00CBNOBYU,Hook2000iam,1,This mash up does not work. It's office meets smash. Ass in all thats wrong and not funny on Office meets all the bad things that happen on smash. I turned it off half way thru.
B00CBNOBYU,Hrothgar,2,Probably too close to reality to be a sitcom.  And it really doesn't play well as satire even though one of the songs does riff off the old theme song from the Mary Tyler Moore show.  Really don't care for any of these characters.  Just superficial fluff without a solid center.
B00CBNOBYU,IparkJons,2,The music was fine. The plot seemed a bit forced to me though. I can't see this being successful. Not sure who the demographic would even be.
B00CBNOBYU,John J. Schubert "Schubej",3,Bebe Neuwirth is the only known actor in this production.  Four interns from different backgrounds come to work at the same company owned (?)by Neuwirth.  She is a harsh manager who enjoys punishing her employees with the fear of being fired held over them.  The gimmick employed for this show is that the principles break into song (as in a Broadway Musical) to express their feelings.  The pilot failed to grab my attention but did hint at the possibilities by not trying to imitate either the flash of Glee or the spectacle of Smash (both of which I think are far too overwhelming).
B00CBNOBYU,Leo R.,3,This show has potential and the cast is good but the amount of musical numbers in 25 minutes is borderline annoying.  I am a huge fan of Glee so I do like musicals/singing but this was almost every other scene during the episode.  I started to like a few characters and wouldn't mind another episode to see if the chemistry develops and also what storyline(s) would begin.  This pilot really borderlines on yes/no on whether it should move forward and nothing is swaying from either side right now.
B00CBNOBYU,Make Believe "MB",1,I'd normally write in detail why this was bad but given that I could only watch half the episode I just can't tell you how bad this was indeed.Watched every other pilot too.Find something better Bebe. You deserve it.
B00CBNOBYU,Mark,1,i was out by the second "song"this is a joke..."every where i look i see a chimpmunk on a waterski".....ugh
B00CBNOBYU,MarquisMark,4,I enjoyed this show thoroughly. Unlike Betas before I actually liked this cast and some things made me actually laugh out loud. And the songs were fun too.I would definitely watch this one.
B00CBNOBYU,MSFRIT "Frit",1,I made it through almost half of the opening song (probably about a minute and a half).  I should have turned it off after the first 30 seconds.This must be some kind of goof right?
B00CBNOBYU,Ms KAM,1,I didn't like it. I'm not a fan of musicals. This would be a good show without all of the singing. Just not my cup of tea.
B00CBNOBYU,Ms. Ruth Levinton,5,I think this is the best of the group.  Loved the characters - Bibi is a gem although she should work on her accent. Hope it makes. I would definitely watch more.
B00CBNOBYU,pametgirl,1,I could only hack ten seconds of this show. It actually made me very nervous and anxious. Singing on the streets of busy NY...Not a good combination...
B00CBNOBYU,peliculafan,5,Loved everything about this sitcom especially that it breaks out into song throughout the episode. It's definitely a change of pace from the usual stale formula of T.V. sitcoms or any show for that matter.
B00CBNOBYU,Robert W. Debord "bobbyd",2,It was a self indulgent vapid display of every thing that's wrong with modern entertainment. It tried so hard to be clever and hip that it wound up being neither.It has potential I in that there was obviously talented players.
B00CBNOBYU,severo,3,Is a sesamo street or muppets for adults ? is for 30 or 40 years old kids ? Launch a version for all audiences....
B00CBNOBYU,Speedynyc,2,It had me for an Internet minute abd tehen I stumbled away.  I really like Constance Wu though - she was like 'Far out' . . more please.
B00CBNOBYU,The OC,1,There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show.  It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops.  This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down.  The songs and singing were mediocre.  The acting and writing was amateurish.  I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth.  She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck.  Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy. Sad.
B00CBNOBYU,wayneit,2,I do not like  many musicals. The idea of people singing will at work all day. Is stupid. Thumbs down on this one.
B00CBNOD0W,A-2-Z Enterprise,3,This was not very entertaining.  I was done before the show was.  Anybody giving this more than 3 stars must be stoned.
B00CBNOD0W,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",4,This show has potential. I kind of like the characters but I'm not attached to them. The comedy is worth my time but not overly done perfect as a late night comedy before bed.
B00CBNOD0W,bc,5,Great start would love to see the whole season.  Wish my teachers were this funny.  One of the best pilots I have seen so far
B00CBNOD0W,Brian "GlobaltechATLAS",1,This has to be one of the worst pilots I have ever seen.  At no point was the dialogue remotely funny.
B00CBNOD0W,Britney,3,This show was hilarious and I'm sure I would have loved the whole thing if I didn't have to turn it off due to the massive amount of swear words. This show would reach to a much larger audience if the language was cleaned up. Does throwing in the f word every other sentence make something that much funnier or does it lose its shock value. Unfortunately I couldn't finish this.
B00CBNOD0W,Bzlindaman,3,It's mediocre. Principal was bad casting. The idea has a ton of potential compared to whats on these days. Take some notes from Workaholics and then tweak it a little.
B00CBNOD0W,ChasNCenTx,3,Used that title for one review already.  About all I can say is 'Meh..&#34;.However I need six more words...yay &#60;===that one's extra.
B00CBNOD0W,Chris's Review,5,Those who can't is a comely series that will keep you laughing through the entire show.  It takes place at a high school as teachers are pulling off crazy stunts. On episode one the principal seems to pick on three teachers while they are trying to get a student in trouble.  The student picks one one of the teachers. A  chain link of crazy antics.Sorry I am not real good with reviews I just know this is a funny show and needs to be considered for the TV line -up. Thanks.
B00CBNOD0W,Christopher R. Williams,5,This show was really effing funny.I totally plan on watching any more episodes. love the characters the writing and the plot. and love the choice for Denver.
B00CBNOD0W,dcn8v,4,This pilot episode makes me oddly nostalgic for Freaks and Geeks. Maybe this is what the kids on that show would have grown into?
B00CBNOD0W,esorale,4,I hated Bad Teacher because I didn't think the teacher was bad enough. These three are truly bad teachers. The scene where he tries to buy drugs with his kid is hilarious! I would definitely watch this again.
B00CBNOD0W,Forrest Whittaker,1,You can't be serious. This was awful. Turned off after 5 minutes. Geared to an adolescent humor level. Nuffield said.
B00CBNOD0W,Hook2000iam,2,NO. Amaz on made 8 comedies. Of them 5 were pure crap and 2 were mostly crap and 1 was partly crap. This fell into the first. It was not the worst of them but it is still crap!
B00CBNOD0W,Hrothgar,3,A Spanish teacher trying to teach Castilian Spanish to a class of somewhat native Mexican speakers of the language; a gym teacher who is a wimp; a history teacher who apparently doesn't know what a book is; and a principal who never catches the students doing anything but easily snags his teachers--sorry but didn't work for me. Should I mention the students all appear to be jerks or bullies. This show doesn't even deserve a grade.
B00CBNOD0W,Jeffery Schroeder,5,This show was a lot of fun. The teachers tormenting the punk students was great to watch. And the guy buying drugs on the street was ridiculous. This show would be something I would watch regularly. But I would just make sure there was some kind of story line that lead somewhere from episode to episode. Those shows that don't seem to lose my attention pretty quickly.
B00CBNOD0W,J,4,Like Strangers with Candy meets Kids in the Hall its a show that is a guilty pleassure to enjoy the bad taste it is. I feel this show may get bad reviews on the mixed personal opinion it gives one rather then the true addicting nature of its humor.
B00CBNOD0W,Karen,1,Could not follow such a stupid theme.  Doubt it will get much further than this pilot.  Not funny at all.
B00CBNOD0W,KMOJR,5,I loved everything about this show. I was laughing the whole way through and I wanted to watch more. Awesome cast and it was well written. This was one of the few that I watched more than once.
B00CBNOD0W,kmoore,5,Wow best show I have seen in a while soooo good I want to watch more! !! This show reminds me of workaholics but maybe even better it is so rediculous that it is hilarious a must watch for everyone who needs a good laugh
B00CBNOD0W,Mark,2,Didnt NBC try this show already? What is this show going to be about? Here is the cast of the show:Lead singer from Likin ParkPoor mans nick swardsonsuper poor joel mchale.How is this rated so highly?
B00CBNOD0W,Meega,1,The title says it all.  I stopped watching this only 10 minutes in.  Immature is a step up for these teachers.  Totally unbelievable and not very funny. Not interested in seeing anymore.
B00CBNOD0W,M. Marks,1,Offensive just for the sake of being offensive. Which I would understand them doing if the show was actually funny. But it wasn't. It was just sad. These teachers represent everything wrong with society. It is not entertaining to watch them swear like a bunch of 5th graders who think they're grown up.
B00CBNOD0W,Ms KAM,4,This show had me laughing the whole way through. I like that the teachers were just as immature as the students.
B00CBNOD0W,Phil,1,I can't stand comedy that is stupid for the sake of stupid.  Dumb and Dumber and it's ilk make me vomit.  2 minutes into this show I could taste the bile and that's as far as I got.
B00CBNOD0W,ReelBigMike,5,This is a great pilot. Extremely funny characters and dialogue with a fairly unique premise. I really hope many more episodes of this show get made.
B00CBNOD0W,Richard D Kiphut,4,Funny concept and well executed in the pilot.This would be a keeper!The changing cast of characters moving through school while keeping some kids from year to year like Glee would allow a continual renewal of heels and good guys for the show.
B00CBNOD0W,RobHH,4,I liked this comedy and would likely watch it if it gets green lighted.  It had several laugh out loud moments.
B00CBNOD0W,techie mike,5,Great show.. So much potential.  I can't wait for more episodes.... I must go out and find some dysfunctional teachers of my own...  should be easy!
B00CBNOD0W,T. Pettit,3,Clever ensemble cast. The three principal teacher characters already have distinct identities without being stereotypes - unusual this early in any new show. The school principal with a new age / hippy view of the world is refreshingly different as is the boozing war vet with an attitude. I actually found myself surprised by the show's twists and turns. Reminded me of Vacation and the classic WKRP. Has a real chance if they can introduce some interesting oddball students to the mix.
B00CBNOD0W,typo_kign,3,Feels very much like a cross between &#34;Strangers with Candy&#34; and &#34;Always Sunny in Philadelphia&#34;. Hapless idiot teachers try to conquer a world of smarter children and fail. A few good lines but they're going to have to work on developing this into something more/better. At least in Always Sunny I feel like the heroes have half a brain and just misuse it. Here I feel like they're just dumb.
B00CBNOD0W,William Franklin Jr.,4,Funny show. Has kind of an Office Space vibe. Or It's Always Sunny. Or Workaholics. Set in a high school.I'd watch it again if it becomes a series.
B00CBNOD0W,Youngatheart,1,THE Writer who wrote this should go back to the bathroom and finish what he was doing. This show doesn't`deserve to be called bad.If I could spell atrocious that would be more appropriate.
B00CBRH2OW,cozzetta,2,Stupid movie! But it was in good condition it did come by the date given. I would purchase from them again. It's not their fault the movie is lame. But customer service was AWESOME!
B00CBRH2OW,Dstress,4,A lot going on here. The atmosphere of the film felt so much like Videodrome at times which I enjoyed. The ideas in the film were so on point with todays worship of celebrity.
B00CBRH2OW,Janice E. Garver,1,I did not care for this movie at all. Thought it would have been much better. Subject line of this movie didn't make sense at all. Sorry I paid $6.99 to watch it.
B00CBRH4YU,Viva,2,The photography and locations are wonderful but the actors are wasted in what is basically a very long ad for no product at all.  Lots of navel gazing and internal monologues regarding the breakdown of a couple.
B00CC3CT5W,Faith,5,I've watched them all. Jeremy wade is OUTSTANDING as he does fishing all over the world. You can see he is the real deal. Wonderful chance to see amazing fish all ove the world. i loved them all.
B00CC3CT5W,Kayla Lake,5,I love this show it's amazing! And I love watching him fish and also talk to people to figure out the story! It's like an adventure in your own home!
B00CCZFT48,G. L. Oneal,5,It is my dream to someday meet these people. They just keep going thru all. They are what ever one needs to be
B00CCZFT48,Rock N Rob,5,They keep getting better. I've been watching Dog for years and still love watching. Wish I starting doing the bail bond business before it got so popular. It's great to watch Leland with his son doing the catch me and hide and seek games. Rock
B00CD4WBMQ,E B Fricks,5,It is never reviled to me why why Caillou has no hair? This little guy is really sweet and children 2 to 4 years will enjoy this show. They even sneak in parenting tips that i'm only just how noticing after several years of listening and watching this show with my children. can't go wrong with this one.
B00CD4WBMQ,Nukumach,4,Seriously I don't know why my two years old likes this so much. She cries to watch it. I wish I could understand it. It must be the age.
B00CD4WBMQ,racergal,5,I had never heard of Caillou until my grandson started watching him. What a great series! Caillou is a little boy that teaches some very good lessons. Kids relate to him. Cute show.
B00CD53ULG,Jennifer Hampton "Hampton Reviews",1,I'm done with VH1 and these trashy classless shows. This did not make any sense at all and most of the scenes did not seem real at all. It seemed as though they were acting this time.
B00CD53ULG,mistic,5,I watch 1 thru 3 all episodes play well in hd cant wait for the next episode! This season is things really do get heated i luv watching the drama unfold!!!!! now this is good ol entertaining reality tv!! lol
B00CD58R6Y,HistoryBuff22,5,This is an excellent series. The quality is what you expect from a National Geographic film. Good research. Very satisfying. I wish the series was longer.
B00CD58R6Y,neichan "neichan",5,The reality of war is very different from even working in the trauma unit in the inner city in the USA. The dedication of each of these men is commendable. You have to admire the selfless way they face incredible risks in a desperate attempt to help injured warriors and civilians. Bless them all.
B00CD58R6Y,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,I was amazed with these shows.  To think this is actually happening right now to our young men.  It is so sad and they are so brave.it makes you angry at war and proud of our men.  It made me want to put an end to all wars.  I couldn't believe how many injuries are from land mines which are so cowardly and devastating.  Watch it.
B00CDBQ9B8,Amazon Customer,4,I remember being a teenager and watching the stop action animation.  All those great si fi flicks.  This was excellent!
B00CDBQ9B8,Amazon Customer,2,This show was hard to follow so I wasn't sure when to laugh. Think it would have been better if the show had a bigger budget.
B00CDBQ9B8,blair,3,Interesting funny one liners a querky spin thru a fantasy world to get away from the every day life of the real world.  Entertaining and goofy at times.  My choice on 3 out of 5 stars the only because the pilot episode is the only one available at this time. Anticipating more to come. Recommend checking it out if you like animation and cartoons.
B00CDBQ9B8,Book Worm,1,This animated sci-fi pilot waan't all that interesting to me.  I like sci-fi but only occasionally watch animated series.  I don't think I am the right demographic for this show.  This would likely appeal to young adult males.  So I don't think I'd watch any more of this.
B00CDBQ9B8,Brian Reisman,4,I'd like to see more... or at least a completed episode. In order to properly resolve my feelings I'd need to see more episodes... but I like where it's going.
B00CDBQ9B8,Clbrosch "cbchess",4,I liked the clay-mation effect of the animation.  The premise is good and the characters were funny. I will definitely watch this show if they make more.
B00CDBQ9B8,Daniel Vellucci,2,Love the team (Big Bang Theory) behind the show but the show has no where to go.  I am bored.
B00CDBQ9B8,DKVMorter,4,This stop action comedy was good but nothing new or exciting. It didn't help that only parts of it were completely produced.
B00CDBQ9B8,Janice E. Garver,1,Terrible show. Way to much cussing which doesn't make the movie any better. Do not watch your wasting your money.
B00CDBQ9B8,jlggfn,4,I like comedy more than any other program. When I started to view it I wasn't impressed and appeared to just another animation. But it got better as it played.
B00CDBQ9B8,John J. Schubert "Schubej",1,This pilot was an animated sci-fi comedy that I struggled with watching to its conclusion.  Part of the issue was the fact that the animation was not completed but getting past that the story was thin and the characters were just not all that endearing. In a future world an egotist makes decisions in trying to eradicate rebels and is inept in his leadership.  The rebels are led by an equally inept individual.  In between are two mismatched characters who accidentally volunteer to go to a suspected rebel held planet for a reconnaissance.  There they run into a girl rebel who thinks they are also rebels (?). Of course one of these two bumblers falls for the girl immediately and then it becomes blah blah blah.  There is an attempt for subtle humor that is neither funny nor subtle.  Not something that I would want revisit.
B00CDBQ9B8,John W. Cross Jr. "suction magic",2,I was so un-impressed with the preview I didn't even watch the pilot. Sorry but animation has been so over done the past few years that it just doesn't hold the same draw for me that it once did. Another miss in my book
B00CDBQ9B8,mrs natural,1,I found this show a little annoying with the cursing. It might be ok but I didn't feel like watching the rest of the pilot because of the language used. It was a little over used. I don't mind a few curse words but for they used it too much.
B00CDBQ9B8,MSFRIT "Frit",4,This has some promise if they can raise enough money to properly animate it.  The stop motion portions were well done and story line pretty good and reasonably well written.
B00CDBQ9B8,NHShopper,1,Not funny. How many puking gags can you put in one episode??? I'm guessing the target audience for this series is 9 year old kids. They *might* think it's funny. Most of these pilot episodes seem to be targeted for the under 25 crows. Older people watch TV on the web too. Please develop something for grown ups!
B00CDBQ9B8,Rexmatti,5,I am very curious about this show.  I enjoyed the pilot and would like to see an entire season and follow where it goes.
B00CDBQ9B8,Richard Siegmeister,4,I really enjoyed this Star Wars spoof.  It reminded my of the Freak Brothers comic book but in space.  The parts that were in stop motion looked great.  I hope this gets picked up.
B00CDBQ9B8,RickM,4,Some of the humor in this show felt a little bit rehashed but overall it was pretty funny. The story taking place in the future and across the galaxy can make for some interesting situations. The characters were a little generic but at least they felt a bit more fleshed out than in some of the other shows. I think this show gets my vote.
B00CDBQ9B8,Speedynyc,4,Very good - do a series of it. thanks!  Red Dwarf meets Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. 2 thumbs up
B00CDBQ9B8,Sydyne,3,It's OK. I wouldn't watch on a regular basis. Storyline of slackers becoming heros because they are the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time. Jokes seemed stale and storyline did not click with me and being new and orginial. I won't watch on a regular basis.
B00CDBQ9B8,S. Young,2,I guess I don't watch much animation which is oriented at adults (at least that's who I thought they were aiming for)and after watching this it would still hold true. The idea of the show is different with the two main characters earning their living with the galactic conglomerate. It starts out in stop motion/claymation but then switches to cartoon animation. (If I read it correctly it's supposed to be all claymation if the show gets picked up but don't quote me.) Either way I just wasn't interest enough to continue watching further episodes. It just did not hook me in.
B00CDBQ9B8,Theresa Lepiane "Theresa",5,Very funny.  If you have ever watched or read any sci fi the jokes are continuous. Consider the life of middle management or lower on the Death Star....This should so be a series.  We need some "funny" in the world today.  Only drawback...too short
B00CDBQNZU,A-2-Z Enterprise,4,Not the greatest show I've ever seen but I'd watch more of them if they make more.  I'm a fan of The Onion News.  This wasn't as entertaining as there normal stuff.  It could use a little more work to be really good.
B00CDBQNZU,Amazon Customer "D.F.",5,Really refreshing show with very unusual writing and comedy. Plus the Onion is hilarious. A must see for comedy affectionados.
B00CDBQNZU,Amazon Prime Pays For Itself,2,How is it that such a funny periodical can never be that funny on TV?  The shorts on their site are considerably better than any of the shows they've put on television.  Even with gloss and star power there's no denying that this is supremely underwhelming.  Too bad.
B00CDBQNZU,Brian T. Marino "Brian",5,I literally had to pause it about 3 or 4 times because I was laughing so hard that I'd miss the next scene.  I would definitely be willing to purchase multiple multiple seasons of this show.  I really hope it gets picked up!
B00CDBQNZU,Citizen John,3,This is the kind of easy to access show that can be watched while half asleep and not have to worry about missing anything.The humor though seemed repetitively low. A series of one-liners can exhaust my patience as I discovered.
B00CDBQNZU,Cletus van Damme,5,This is by far one of the funniest pilots I've ever seen. Smart writing with a dark twist. The Onion is a treasure trove of amazing jokes and biting satire.Wired Magazine this month said "Satire is reality pushed to its logical limit; journalism conveys basic truth. The Onion does both. The Onion calls itself "America's finest news source." The funny part? It is." The same could easily be said with this show and its comments on 24 hour cable news.
B00CDBQNZU,CO GIRL,3,I didn't think that it wasn't very impressive. It had some good moments but I didn't look for more episodes.
B00CDBQNZU,Cristina Hiatt,4,This is very fast paced and pretty funny. A lot of names in this one.  I think I'd watch it regularly.
B00CDBQNZU,Daniel Allen,5,Contains all of the Onion's unique biting satire and promises to lampoon the pretentious nature of news anchors and workroom dramas at the same time. Great casting and constant hilariousness. This is my pick.
B00CDBQNZU,destiny 3,5,The Onion is absolutely great with short comedy videos but has struggled to bring consistent humor to a long form. This time they have captured the magic. A fake news network offers all kinds of room for satire and they nailed it. I liked everyone in the cast. I really want to see more of this series. Go Onion!
B00CDBQNZU,Donald E. Silva,3,This show is just like the Onion as you read on-line. It&#8217;s zany and funny. I think most people will like it.
B00CDBQNZU,Doug D. Johnson "Doug Johnson",5,I thought this show was really funny. I'd sign up today for the season if I could. Please produce the whole season.
B00CDBQNZU,jared,5,If the rest of the season is like the first episode Amazon might really have something here. It was funny awkward and everything the Onion should be! Really hope this one keeps up!
B00CDBQNZU,JG,5,This is one of the best pilot episodes I've ever seen.  It has a unique mixture of "The Newsroom" style humour and "Arrested Development".  The entire cast is fantastic and the writing is too.  The characters seem fully-fleshed out from the very beginning of the episode.  This needs to get picked up.
B00CDBQNZU,Karen,2,I found this one a bit wierd. It was hard to grasp how the characters were so hard souled.  I still wonder why I watched the whole thing.
B00CDBQNZU,KMOJR,4,There were many funny parts and I really enjoyed watching this episode. Some of the humor is better served in short clips but there were hilarious parts and overall I really enjoyed this show.
B00CDBQNZU,M56,3,Like the satire on media and it's entertaining but some parts are just way over the top and not believable.  Not something I can keep on watching for an entire season at this rate.
B00CDBQNZU,makdove,1,I dislike jokes that slander Christianity.  Showing a picture of Jesus on the cross and telling someone to get a closeup of the bulge.  If you did anything like that to any other belief system you would be characterized as a bigot and you might even be fired for it.  Not so if your bigotry is aimed at Christianity.  There is an American Pastor imprisoned in Iran who has been sentenced to 8 years in that prison because he tried to bring a message of love instead of hate to that country.  They are torturing him for that.  He will probably die in that prison at the hands of his torturers.  There are reports that he is bleeding internally from constant beatings but the Iranians wont get him a doctor.  So whoever wrote this crap that is supposed to be funny is a Christian bigot. I'm sure your very proud of yourself.
B00CDBQNZU,Make Believe "MB",4,I worry that the show could go too over the top or be too snarky but I really enjoyed it. I'll watch season one if you come out with it.More on the lower sub-basement please and the whole corporate business controlling everything.
B00CDBQNZU,Ms KAM,3,It was ok. It's not as funny as the actual The Onion. The characters seem a little silly. The show is trying to parody everything but doesn't quite do it as well as The Onion videos.
B00CDBQNZU,Nick Kaspar,5,Please please please make this into an on-going series.  The comic timing and deadpan jokes were perfect.  Each and every actor played their parts brilliantly.  The best description is &#34;The Office&#34; meets &#34;The Daily Show.&#34;  Match made in heaven.
B00CDBQNZU,P. Manley "book lover",4,This reminded me of the old SNL skits (and I mean OLD--early 1970s when they were really good).  Might not be everyone's type of humor but I enjoyed it.
B00CDBQNZU,repple321,4,It's beyond SNL delivered in the style of Lloyd Bridges ala Airplane.  Pretty funny.  The 'love scene' at the end just cracked me up.  I'd watch more of this for sure.  Bring it on!!
B00CDBQNZU,R. Geweniger,1,There was nothing 'biting' or 'sharp' about this. It was so boring I hit the back arrow so I could write this review before I forgot I'd watched the thing.
B00CDBQNZU,Robert W. Debord "bobbyd",5,Onion news empire was a smart and funny parody on the state of network and cable news in the 24/7 news cycle. I look forward to the next episodes.
B00CDBQNZU,TheRaven,4,This show has potentia to be a really funny show.  I liked the acting and the plot and I like the kid from Malcolm in the Middle.Watch it you won't be sorry!
B00CDBQNZU,T. Pettit,3,TV News is easy to make fun of but Onion steps it up a notch. A nice mix of weird but nearly believable characters who try to keep Onion going by finding the most farfetched stories and presenting them as the news. The "headlines" reporting is funny and is a highlight. View Onion as a cross between Broadcast News and the newsroom scenes from Superman. Not sure they have given the brilliant Jeffrey Tambor enough to do so far at least. Given the fast pace and sheer absurdity they may achieve the holy grail of this kind of comedy - the immortal Airplane.
B00CDBQNZU,Xevin,5,This needs to have a few seasons made. Best pilot so far. Best new show of 2013. I had to pause it multiple times because I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. I think I just had a satire overload...This better get made or I'll cancel my prime membership and pay full shipping!!!!
B00CDBQNZU,xloner12,5,This show had me cracking up. The cast worked very well and the they have talent. Ending was a little weird compared to the rest of the show but that is a very minor quirk. Really think this would make a great series.
B00CDBQP58,Amazon Customer,2,The actors try to use foul language to make up for a generally poor story line. I watched two episodes.
B00CDBQP58,ElceeR,5,Very funny! and probably so true to the life of a congressman.  The acting is superb and the humor is right on funny!
B00CDBR1P6,A-2-Z Enterprise,5,I would watch this show.  It's good.  If they could really do what they are talking about it would be so much better than facebook.
B00CDBR1P6,Adam Deming,4,This is one of the better pilots Amazon has out now.  Little boost in production quality and it would a good series.  Like the main characters and the parking app.  Had some nice one liners.  only change i would make is Charlie Saxton.
B00CDBR1P6,A. Gaballa,5,These half adults stumbling through life are endearing.  I liked them.  Characters are well drawn and the situations make sense as though any one of us might have gotten there as well.  It was also important to me that the characters changed in response to their experiences.
B00CDBR1P6,Alan C,5,I honestly can't describe this and give it justice. It is a great mix of raunchy and nerd humor... a must watch and I NEED this to be a series.
B00CDBR1P6,Amazon Customer,4,Loved this show and I thought it was supper funny. This is like the big bang theory with more nerds.
B00CDBR1P6,Amazon Customer,3,This was an ok watch. It kept my attention and there were humorous parts. Has potential. I did like that I was not familiar with any of the actors aside from Ed Begly Jr. And they were pretty good.
B00CDBR1P6,Amazon Customer "jzilla techjunkie",4,This is one of the best pilots I've seen and since The Office was canceled I've found my replacement. The awkward characters remind me of some my friends and the situational comedy is believable.
B00CDBR1P6,Amazon Customer "McG",5,This is definitely the best pilot.Can't believe this was so well done.Make this one.  Would watch every episode.
B00CDBR1P6,Atomkey,3,Interesting so far - I will give it a further chance. if it makes season 2 I will be further interested. Is what it says = a group of software developers trying to launch a beta test of their new app. Three stars because it's kinda iffy (for me) if it will get and keep a viewer audience.
B00CDBR1P6,Bill Wall,2,I checked it out since I'm a big fan of the Big Bang Theory but I guess I'm not nerdish enough for this one. I guess I'll have to pass if it actually ever comes to TV.
B00CDBR1P6,B. J. Rosen,5,Thought the characters were very likeable. The plot moved right along. I thought it was very relateable but then I've been doing tech startups for 30 years so I may be biased. However it should appeal to the same demographic as Big Bang.
B00CDBR1P6,Bob K,4,Interesting group of characters. Each week you learn a little bit more about these people and the environment they are in however improbable it is.
B00CDBR1P6,Book Worm,5,This is in my top 3 of the 8 adult comedies I watched.  I enjoyed these geeks and misfits!  Definitely want to see more.
B00CDBR1P6,Brian Reisman,4,This is one of the new pilots that i'm most excited about... I just need to know... when can I expect to see more?
B00CDBR1P6,Brian T. Marino "Brian",5,Brilliant setting for a sitcom.  I don't know why we haven't seen it before.  The cast and script are really excellent as well.  I was cracking up throughout and even though it was only 22 minutes I felt like I knew the characters as well as I would in a sitcom I've been watching for several seasons.  It's lived in and the chemistry is great.
B00CDBR1P6,C Falt,3,The characters were funny but the show is too blah...not all developers are males in early twenties. I stopped watching it after 10 minutes.
B00CDBR1P6,Chuck "RcProductions",4,The writing and stars make for an interesting ride through young companies and their values.  Some fun stuff thrown in to make it worth the time.
B00CDBR1P6,Clbrosch "cbchess",5,Very well done.  Great characters done by excellent actors.  The casting is superb.  The story is thoughtful and the hook is engaging.  The dialog was very sharp and well done. I really like the music score as well. I can't wait for this to become a full time show.  Very funny
B00CDBR1P6,ClearBucket,5,I am a tech nerd and its good to see a series getting in on start-ups. This turned out to be funny and a good view of what start-ups sometimes have to go through with friendships and to acquire funding. Can't wait to see the next one.
B00CDBR1P6,Daniel Vellucci,3,I am curious as to where the story line is going to go. The show has decent characters but a week plot.  Would continue to watch.
B00CDBR1P6,David E. Holtzinger,5,I'm no spring chicken but I thought this show was fresh funny and fun to watch. I'd fit it in to my TV watching schedule. Hope it makes it.
B00CDBR1P6,D. Ernstzen "DE",4,I thought it would be just a goofy look at tech nerds in the work place with some crass humor to make it funny. I was pleasantly surprised. It had a great story line and I could see how people in this environment would react in the way that they did. It was entertaining and I wanted more by the time I got to the end of episode 4. Great viewing and well done.
B00CDBR1P6,devkar9700,2,This was one of the pilots that I knew that I would like.  However I was surprised that 12 minutes into the pilot I hadn't laughed and I wasn't interested nor invested into any of the characters.  It wasn't bad but no where near my expectations.
B00CDBR1P6,dman,3,A good look at the world of start ups. Cant help but like it. Characters are loveable and likeable.They face problemslike everyone else.
B00CDBR1P6,D. Mark Waldoch "Mark the Guitar Teacher",4,So far it has been good. Actors are good and funny although believable. Wish all episodes were available at once as opposed to coming out in small groups. Feel a little taken with the first Prime show being Alpha House and the second Betas. What's next - Three's ....?
B00CDBR1P6,DoctorBob,4,keeping it believable will be a problem for writers in future episodes. The plot device is a bit narrow in its current incarnation. But the promise of good satire is intruiging.
B00CDBR1P6,Douglas A. Ray "D_Ray",5,We live in THE valley and enjoy this humorous and irreverent slice of what happens in the startup world of young geeks.
B00CDBR1P6,ERB,4,This was a really good show and would have gotten 5 stars without all the vulgarity. Real potential just tune it down. The 2 main leads were fabulous and I loved the phone booths. Other great moments as well but too off color for main stream audiences. Stick with the story and great characters.
B00CDBR1P6,ES,4,The mix of characters is good but they aren't explored in much depth.  You don't get much of an idea why they do what they do.  The scripts are uneven.
B00CDBR1P6,Evansville Jill,5,I think this pilot has the potential for many interesting season's.The cast seems to have good chemistry.I hate the title though.
B00CDBR1P6,Fish,4,This is a good solid show. Some very funny moments. Good music.  Much better than half the crap on TV today.
B00CDBR1P6,IparkJons,4,The show has the perfect blend of comedy and story. It's really the only one that left me wanting more. Please continue this one.
B00CDBR1P6,Jacqueline S Mihalik,5,Funny. Very likeable and in depth characters. Can't wait for the next season! This show has it all. is there an app like brb out there???
B00CDBR1P6,James A. Moore "Jim",3,This was almost one of those series that would only make it if I were bored out of my skull. Very predictable.
B00CDBR1P6,Janelle Anderson "artist",2,teen age boys talk about sex all the time. not alpha males. small confined work space no privacy or quiet.
B00CDBR1P6,jared,3,But that could all change. It wasn't the type of pilot that got me hooked but maybe in time it will be a show that is good.
B00CDBR1P6,Jeffery Schroeder,4,I really enjoyed this episode. It was well cast and had some decent writing. The first episode did a great job establishing each character and what their drive was. This should definitely be made into a full series because it's great.
B00CDBR1P6,Jeremy Van Pelt,4,I did not expect much from this based on the description of the show. I found it entertaining and hope that Amazon will go ahead with this series.
B00CDBR1P6,J. Gabrielson,4,Really love the show and would like to give it another half a star. I am hoping for more episodes. Much different from the usual junk on TV!!!
B00CDBR1P6,JH,3,it didnt feel like the characters or actors actually knew each others characters.  it was okay but not good enough for me
B00CDBR1P6,J. Miles,4,The acting is not that great but the story is very relevant to todays social media addicted world.  it definitley deserves a full season of viewing.
B00CDBR1P6,Joe,4,This looks to have some potential and the actors are good...  waiting to see more story arc and hope they continue to get more into the silicon valley vibe
B00CDBR1P6,John J. Schmidt,4,This is an interesting program. The trials and tribulations of starting an internet business by a group of geeks. I liked it immediately.
B00CDBR1P6,jpwhel,4,The life and times of the Beta group is interesting.  I like the character development and look forward to future episodes and seansons.
B00CDBR1P6,Karen,2,I watched some of this story.  Not too inclined to make it one of those got to watch the whole series type.
B00CDBR1P6,Kathleen M Thomas,4,This was show enjoyable. I kind of like the premise since I am a bit of a geek.  It is mostly predicable.
B00CDBR1P6,Kaylis,5,I think I like this show. I think I lykut ah lut. Awesome show! Can not wait to see more. Its definitely going in my watchlist...
B00CDBR1P6,KMOJR,4,This episode was funny and leaves you satisfied and wanting to watch more. I think this show will be entertaining and worth watching if the pilot is picked up.
B00CDBR1P6,Lamp base bracket,4,This show is a favorite of my daughters so I watch it with her.  She would probably rate it with 5 stars.
B00CDBR1P6,L. G. Gerstle "East Coast Knitter",2,I found the pilot sophomoric and iterative of The Big Bang Theory. Nothing original here. Found myself looking forward to the end.
B00CDBR1P6,LuvJewels,3,I didn't get the concept of this Amazon Pilot.  It's jokes fell flat and the actors seemed stiff and wooden.  It's an okay look at young professionals trying to make it in a fierce atmosphere.
B00CDBR1P6,Make Believe "MB",2,I looked for the humor. Didn't find it. Was it hiding in the code on one of their computers? Seriously a snoozzzzze fest. Like Ed Begley Jr but the whole series should not move forward. Admittedly I'm not in this age bracket anymore but do work in tech so at least some of this content I should have found delight in however sadly I did not.Next.
B00CDBR1P6,Mardee "Mardee",4,I like it!  I tend to believe most TV shows progress to slowly and this one is no different.  But I love the cast and the story line.  I have watched all the episodes so I must like it... I have recommended it as well.  It's a cute show...
B00CDBR1P6,Mark Burns,5,I really liked this show. I think it's worth seeing a whole season. I would watch more. I hope their app catches fire and we see how they handle success.
B00CDBR1P6,Mark,5,this is worth checking out. it is a easy sell to big bang theory fans.I hope this gets picked up. I would follow this.
B00CDBR1P6,Marshaleigh,3,This ensemble cast has potential. There are some very funny and clever moments. I hope there will be more episodes.
B00CDBR1P6,Melesio Gonzalez,4,I enjoyed the comedic twist the team of innovative start ups got involved with while trying launch their social web site.
B00CDBR1P6,Mid-Century Todd,5,I enjoyed the characters and dialogue. All fresh faces do a great job and better than most sitcoms you'll see on broadcast or cable TV (although that bar is set fairly low these days). I plowed through the whole &#34;season&#34; in no time and look forward to new episodes.
B00CDBR1P6,Moss,4,I find myself actually enjoying the show. I guess it helps I have IT degrees and I get the humor.
B00CDBR1P6,mparrish,5,Loved Betas.Interesting twists and turns.Keeps you wanting more.Would highly recommend........Would like to see the showing increased to Saturday as well.Lets have a Beta Party.
B00CDBR1P6,Mrfil7 "Swissman in D.C.",4,This feels like a different take on a mix between Entourage and How to make it in America. Topic is right on point for the times and it's funny and has a real good plot.The cliffhanger at the end is scary as it almost feels like the creators don't know where they are taking this show themselves. So I hope they do and I hope they maintain the quality!
B00CDBR1P6,Ms KAM,4,I thought this show was really great. It gives a good vision of what the start up world is like. Some people unfamiliar with that world might not get it.
B00CDBR1P6,Ms. Ruth Levinton,1,If I could I would have given it zero stars. It was painful to watch - I saw no clever dialogue.
B00CDBR1P6,Oregonian,3,Ed Bagley is superb in this show.  Show overall is good just a lot of tech and to tell the truth think social media with everyone spilling there guts is the stupidest thing ever invented.....along with reality TV!
B00CDBR1P6,Oteka,4,It was interesting and different. It didn't seem like it is playing to a low brow crowd. The writing was engaging and I would definitely watch more episodes if they are made.
B00CDBR1P6,Paul Fischer,5,I love Betas It was the best of all of the pilots that I previewed. I encourage you to turn this into a series. It will appeal to anyone who is involved in the tech world either a producer or consumer. It was very funny.
B00CDBR1P6,PoohBearsf,5,I really enjoyed this show and hope it gets picked up for a second season. I love that the characters have such varied personality quirks.
B00CDBR1P6,pops95b,1,I was bored throw this whole show. I watched the first episode and found myself constantly getting up and wandering around out of boredom with the show.
B00CDBR1P6,P. Tibbs "Pat Tibbs",3,The target market for this series has to be millenials. While I watched a few episodes I wasn't anxious to get back to it. It's funny but just not my cup of tea
B00CDBR1P6,Ray Anthony Pruitt II,4,Topical as it relates to the rat race of today with start-ups popping up all over the place trying to make a name for themselves. Good stuff.
B00CDBR1P6,repple321,5,Loved it.  Laughed.  Cringed.  Laughed more.  Can't wait to see the development in future episodes.  Where are the - they ready yet?  ;)
B00CDBR1P6,Richard Newton,4,I like it. I'm not sure why though. It's a really sick show. Maybe that's what makes it fun. I wonder if it's going to last though.
B00CDBR1P6,Richard R,3,I really don't understand why the show needs to expend on some of the subjects it is going into. It seems to be looking for a theme but still has not found it self. Not great but ok.
B00CDBR1P6,Robert,3,I think this would be a great show to watch if the obviously gay actor playing the main character wasn't written to be heterosexual.
B00CDBR1P6,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",4,This series is for the young crowd. Lots of episodes are silly to me. But why should I understand the 20 something crowds goings on? I'll keep following the series to see where it goes.
B00CDBR1P6,Sam,3,The storyline was pretty good at first but soon got boring. I haven't completed watching it yet. Too much arguing
B00CDBR1P6,S. C. Murphy "clanmurphy",4,The thing I was initially impressed with was that they actually filmed in San Francisco and didn't try to fake it with Los Angeles or Vancouver. They also nailed the high tech culture perfectly. From the get-go this created a believable premise and characters which are people I have met in high tech. We enjoyed this and look forward to season 2.
B00CDBR1P6,Scott Foster,2,This was my least favorite of all the pilots I viewed. The tech jargon felt overwhelming. The love interest story felt forced to attract the women. I didnt really care if they ended up getting Ed Begley Jr's help or not.This show just wasnt for me.
B00CDBR1P6,Seb311,5,By far the best of the comedy pilots I have watched so far. I really hope this gets picked up. Feels like a show you would see on HBO. Clever and funny and an excellent cast. I really want to see more episodes!!!!
B00CDBR1P6,Spencer Nassau,5,Great story with plenty of plot and human elements to create something that shows what silicon valley can be like.
B00CDBR1P6,Ssidget,5,This was one of the best pilots of a new show I've seen in a very long time. The writing is clever and witty with a touch of realism in the vastly expanding technology race to develop the best app. I could see this show expanding over a season or two if the writers continue to deliver quality writing like the premiere. The actors are like-able and you root for the main characters. This is a show I would want to see more from.
B00CDBR1P6,SuperDad "SuperDad",3,Not bad. The bearded guy is a joke. I'm pretty sure they only put in the nudity for an attention grab. It didn't do anything to help the story. Sounded like the story was still evolving as well as they characters so we'll see...
B00CDBR1P6,Sym,5,I actually enjoyed watching this. Witty cast and colorful comments along with that one female in the group. It is interesting and makes me want to see more.
B00CDBR1P6,S. Young,5,I could care about the characters of the show and that's what usually makes me want to watch. I am also not familiar with any of the actors but it really didn't matter. So we have geeks trying to make it in the start up world of smart phone apps but specifically they are trying to market their social app. I thought it was funny and would be curious how the show's characters progress. Hope this one makes it!
B00CDBR1P6,Terry Richardson,4,Good series. Would like to see where they go next. I think they will have to introduce... probably two more characters or further develop existing characters.
B00CDBR1P6,TheDuke,5,Great show. Acting and writing is wonderful and witty. The technical information throughout the show is actually very accurate when they speak about it.
B00CDBR1P6,T. Pettit,4,Just about perfect. Captures what a startup team is all about - total commitment to getting significant seed capital from guys with the money. Sometimes a good idea is optional. Pretty sure most VCs I know would object to the over the top lifestyle displayed by Murcheson but the incredible competition among VCs to pick winners and get bragging rights is on the mark. Of the four man management team I can only figure out what two bring to the game. Looking forward to next steps since things are going too well right now.
B00CDBR1P6,Varun,4,I really like this show. It is well acted and story has enough pace. It feels like a real story and I will like this show to get more eyeballs.
B00CDBR1P6,xloner12,4,I'm in IT and I went into this thinking there would be a lot of stupid techno talk and jokes that weren't really but made it sound ITish like 24. Instead I came away from a show that was a bit charming and funny even if you don't know what they are talking about. Hope to see it as a full season.
B00CDBTQCW,A. Johnson "surfwood4",5,The characters are right on target. &#34;Prayer Brunch&#34; and the January 10th episode - the funeral were the funniest tv I've seen in two decades.
B00CDBTQCW,Alla,5,This is Amazon's answer to Netflix's House of Cards and it is a success. Funny and emotional. Drags you in and keep you watching..Hope season 2 is on the way asap.
B00CDBTQCW,Amazon Customer,5,Alpha House was surprisingly funny and entertaining. The leaders of America are basically the frat guys of Animal House all grown up. Funny and lots of promise!
B00CDBTQCW,Amazon Customer "k9sage",3,The  show has improved and the language is not quite as bad in the later episodes but the stereotypes are over the top and badly one sided.  Please be fair and show both sides to be as bad as they are.
B00CDBTQCW,Amazon Customer "no relation 2 sylvia",2,The best comedies are caricatures of life. The Senators portrayed in Alpha House are less caricature and more true to reality to be funny. The show just magnifies the sad state of American politics today. Don't think it would last a season.
B00CDBTQCW,Annie Hall,3,The writers and rest of cast still have to step up to the plate a bit but it won't take much to make the second part of the first season a winner!
B00CDBTQCW,Ann Shumaker,4,A funny light hearted look at the people who run the show.  Just folks in a crazy place and time
B00CDBTQCW,Barbara J. Mcdermott,5,I just love this series. So much truth in this series about our elected officials. The four politicians who live in Alpha House are a hoot. John Goodman is a standout. Cannot wait for the next episode.
B00CDBTQCW,Big A "Wesley",4,I really enjoyed watching this show about how funny US government is behinds the scenes.. I hope other people enjoy it so Amazon decides to make it.
B00CDBTQCW,B. J. LARKIN "The Beej",5,Cute series nothing very cerebral happening yet but liking the characters thus far... I know I am not expecting &#34;The Wire goes to Washington&#34; but it is enjoyable to watch
B00CDBTQCW,Book Worm,4,I enjoyed this pilot.  The actors were good.  This comedic look into what it's like to be a politician would keep my interest!
B00CDBTQCW,Brett T Moore,5,I love this show!  Amazon hit one out of the park with this one.  I definitely recommend this show.  Watch it!
B00CDBTQCW,C. Badgley,5,this show has done nothing but get better by the episode.  the first couple move a little slow (as is often the case with new shows) but they have really found their rhythm here.i grew up reading Gary Trudeau (yes i am a nerd) and was wondering how his storytelling would play out in such a different medium. fortunately he has crossed over quite well.the actors in this production are really terrific. when i said the show had found 'their' rhythm it includes them. they portray their varied characters with terrific ease.i voted Republican from the time i turned 18 until the second Bush took office. this show does a great job of showing what old school Republicans used to stand for. it does take jabs at the fruits and nuts on the fringe. but they've earned those marks.
B00CDBTQCW,Cheryl,4,Alpha House is very funny. I wonder how much of this show is fiction and how much is reality. The show make you think.
B00CDBTQCW,chikiBABY,5,Cast combination and interaction makes this show work for me. Republican conservatives can actually take claim to contributing to the show. I'm sure they just won't pick up on that though.
B00CDBTQCW,chinagirl "ncchinagirl",4,I absolutely love John Goodman and he makes this show. Love the premise of these Senators living together in DC. This show is laugh out loud funny. I watch a new episode every Friday and usually watch each episode twice; once alone and next time with a family member (it is that good and you miss stuff the first go around).
B00CDBTQCW,ClearBucket,5,This gives a different light to DC vs the Netflix House of Cards. This is a very funny take on representatives that are about there daily lives as much as it is just trying to stay a rep. If you like House of Cards and wish to also get in on the funnier side of DC this is it.
B00CDBTQCW,CV,5,I really enjoyed and recommend it to anybody who likes politics and would like to know more about how our great system works. Great actors and great characters.
B00CDBTQCW,Daniel Vellucci,4,Its the closes thing to a hit that you have in your line up shows.  I would continue to watch.
B00CDBTQCW,Darrell Irvin "Darrell druidwriter",5,Watched an episode last night and laughed to tears. Of course I feel all incumbent politicians closely resemble their comedycounterparties  parts to the t.
B00CDBTQCW,Darren Slawson,4,It was good.  Great character development and you get to see just how much fluff and BS is in the world of politics lol
B00CDBTQCW,David E. Holtzinger,5,Good actors. Its great to see John Goodman again. It's funnier than VEEP. Hope they don't save their digs just for Republicans. Both sides of the aisle deserve to be castigated. In a humorous manner of course.
B00CDBTQCW,destiny 3,5,I have enjoyed this first season with episodes that have been quite funny to me. It has a very good cast and I hope for a second season.
B00CDBTQCW,djr311,4,I love this from the pilot.  The characters are so laughable but believeable at the same time.  Making fun of DC but in a repectful way.
B00CDBTQCW,D. Mark Waldoch "Mark the Guitar Teacher",5,Good to great acting coupled with smart writing has made me a fan. Excellent video/audio streaming makes it a pleasure to watch.
B00CDBTQCW,D. Walters "Florida Boy",4,So far pretty good -- humor is good and the acting good. A bit of a liberal interpretation and slant which makes it look one sided but for a political parody funny.
B00CDBTQCW,E. Magno,3,This show is okay. I like John Goodman but it seems to me that the material could get old fast
B00CDBTQCW,ENH1142,3,I totally missed how/why these Senators are roommates and two of them share a couch? This needs to be explained... Its kind of like a bizarro world House of Cards. Good cast and writing beyond the totally confusing set up.
B00CDBTQCW,Forrest Whittaker,4,This show has some promise. good cast and story line was interesting and not too over the top. I will watch future episodes.
B00CDBTQCW,FUBAR-EOD,5,Only watch 4 episodes on first day and this series is a great comedy!  Worth making time to watch entire series on a weekend with friends.
B00CDBTQCW,Gene Hacker,5,John Goodman is Great Program is funny Probably alot of truth in the humor. Mr Goodman makes St. louis proud
B00CDBTQCW,Ginger L. Gilmore,5,The characters were good picks and there were lots of funny moments. Thought the story lines were mixed and matched.
B00CDBTQCW,H. D. Zabitz,4,I love Gary Trudeau & he has created true to life venal  Republicans in all their hypocritical glory. It doesn't get t much better or funnier than this?
B00CDBTQCW,HeMeGrrrr,4,I'm hooked...... for now. The characters are fun as hell. I like the possibilities for future storylines. This cast is terrific. Hope all can keep up my interest.
B00CDBTQCW,Hook2000iam,4,Not perfect but I did laugh. I can see this getting much better. To top it off it has John Goodman for crying out loud!
B00CDBTQCW,James A. Moore "Jim",4,I cold use the headline for the comment. He does make the show. It's a political satire that makes sense.
B00CDBTQCW,Jeffery Schroeder,5,This show was very well done. The casting of each character was great and the writing was very well done. John Goodman is as great as ever and is right at home playing a Republican senator. This show out of all of the Amazon Originals I've seen so far has the potential to be a big hit.If I weren't already an Amazon Prime Member I would probably join just to watch this.
B00CDBTQCW,jessica pavish,5,Love this show! It's one of the most entertaining and funny shows I've seen in a long time. Hope Amazon keeps up the great original content.
B00CDBTQCW,J. Gabrielson,4,John Goodman and the ensemble cast do well in humanizing the Republicans in Congress. This is not a difficult task:-)The Republicans are so easy. The Dems aren't too far behind. Make no mistake; this is a farce and very broad humor. I think it much better than the 90% junk on broadcast TV.
B00CDBTQCW,J. Jones,3,There was a few moments that I've laughed at and the other times it was interesting. When and if there's more to it I'll watch it.
B00CDBTQCW,joe,5,Show just makes ya.wonder what's going to happen next. And how much of this actually happens in government. I just wish.politicians  actually had there comedy
B00CDBTQCW,John J. Schmidt,4,Funny hidden messages here? I don't doubt this show is entirely intended to make Republicans look foolish. Too bad they could have slammed the Tea Party and made the likes of John Bohner and John McCain supporters of the show.
B00CDBTQCW,Karen P,3,This show is pretty entertaining.  I love John Goodman and wondered what he has been up to.  I don't know if I'll watch the entire series but I like the idea of prime video series from Amazon.
B00CDBTQCW,kayla,2,This show was funny at parts! But boring for the most part! There was way to much cursing that was unnecessary to make it funny. The constant cursing took away from the storyline of the show! The black guy was the funniest part of the show! The storyline didn't hook me to make me want more right now! Probably wouldn't watch another episode! :(
B00CDBTQCW,Kee,5,I luv this show! The scene when the authorities are coming to trot the room mate off to prison is LMBO funny! Both Clark Johnson and John Goodman are great leads. The cast is spot on and they have great timing.  I did not know Amazon Video was this good until I saw Mr. Bezos on 60 min.  I am looking forwad to bingeing on Alpha Dogs and other progarams throughout the holiday season.
B00CDBTQCW,Kindle Customer,4,I have watched all episodes and enjoyed each one.  I just hope that they do not represent how our Senators really operate during their stay in Washington.
B00CDBTQCW,Len Brown,3,Enjoying this series.  It helps if you are a Democrat.  well written intelligent humor.  Gary Trudeau proves himself one more time.
B00CDBTQCW,Linda S "readinglife",4,I am surprised that Amazon produced such a sleek show. U thought I was watch HBO!  Can't rwait for the season.
B00CDBTQCW,lucy1895,4,Never thought of Congressmen living in a fraternity style home.  Interesting view of politics.  I read a review that says this shows the 'right'  as fools ... does.  Haven't noticed any of the 'left' being superb either.  It is a funny view of the political world with great casting.
B00CDBTQCW,LuvJewels,5,A well intentioned comedy that focuses on four senators sharing a home in D.C.  This is easily the top of the class in Amazon's Pilots.  Having the only show with seasoned actors this is the most I laughed in a long tim.
B00CDBTQCW,Make Believe "MB",5,Liked it from top to bottom. Send me an email alert when the full season launches. Winner!It has a bit of the vibe from Veep on HBO which I like. It's politics lite with a heaping side of day-to-day living in the bubble that is Capital Hill. I live in the beltway and see a lot of humor in this.I'm green lighting this series. It's a go!
B00CDBTQCW,Mark Burns,5,I loved Alpha House. I would become a Prime member to watch a whole season. The acting was great. John Goodman knows how to deliver his lines.
B00CDBTQCW,Meega,4,Wasn't sure what to expect but this satire about politicians is very well written and humorous.  This pilot episode captures the absurdity of political life well.  Looking forward to the elections!
B00CDBTQCW,Melesio Gonzalez,4,I'm a politics junkie and enjoyed watching the make believe fantasy lighter personal side of politicians that this series portrays.
B00CDBTQCW,mgp,3,Started out with High Hopes...really like many members of the cast in many thingsBUT wore thin in a few episodes and though we trudged on through anotherit just aint funny with The Congress we are enduring now....
B00CDBTQCW,Mrfil7 "Swissman in D.C.",5,John Goodman really makes this show! He is like Lebron and makes everyone around him better. I would qualify this as the comedic equivalent to House of Cards!
B00CDBTQCW,ms,3,I'm interested to see where this will go and hope some of the more &#34;stereotypical&#34; things get a little less stereotypical.
B00CDBTQCW,muddyboots,5,I love the actors and the characters they are creating.  For reason I think I have seen them on TV in real life in some of the same situations.  Haha..  Strange fiction relating reality.
B00CDBTQCW,Olethes A. Hodges,4,This show is hilarious...John Goodman plays Gil John a perfect lazy inconsiderate Politian. Focusing on different perspective from different ethnic cultures with inexcusable power. Love it when a show depicts the political climate as it is...&#34;We the people&#34; want to see this more often. I'll sum it up with two words.....&#34;THE TRUTH&#34;.I would recommend this show for anybody with an open mind!
B00CDBTQCW,Onthepedals,5,Love the show!!! We really look forward to every new episode each week. The 4 main characters are diverse enough to provide plenty of unending comedy yet they probably aren't that different from the real politicians they mimic from both sides of the aisle. We hope the show lasts awhile. Great job Amazon!!!
B00CDBTQCW,Pat Achor,5,Alpha House is hilarious!  The cast is excellent and the show really skewers our politicians.  And they certainly deserve it.  It is easy to see Gerry Trudeau's fine hand behind this.  Every episode has me laughing through most of it.  I wait each week for the next episode to be released.  Keep em coming!!
B00CDBTQCW,Patricia Appelquist,5,Why? OMG I would pee in my pants because I am laughing so hysterically This is really well written and very good acting  by everyone they do a great job of it and that is just a testament to the creator and the writers and actors. This is fabulous almost makes me want to be a republican voter....a  l  m  o s t
B00CDBTQCW,Patricia J. Owen,4,The series is good. But not the type that I really lean towards. I really like detective shows.  I'm sure the series is realistic; maybe that's the problem!
B00CDBTQCW,Paul Danneman,5,It is a satirical look at what most of us suspect that members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives conduct our nation's affairs.
B00CDBTQCW,Pen Name,3,I enjoyed Alpha House.  It was a great mix of comedy and politics.  There is humor all throughout the show.  I would recommend this show and I'm looking forward to Season 2.
B00CDBTQCW,P. Jackson,4,This is a funny series which takes pot shots at Republicans and their beliefs. Well performed and with a script that is generally gritty and on target with occasional comedic points that that are over done.
B00CDBTQCW,ReaperMan,4,Ehh republicans. I hate em. This is off color comedy about politics. In the end after the credits they all........
B00CDBTQCW,Richard Dietzel,4,Standard political comedy but very well played but a top notch cast and writer.  Wanda Sykes and John Goodman look like they're having a blast.
B00CDBTQCW,Richard D Kiphut,5,Very funny show.The acting was spot on and the plots seem to have lots of places to go.A comedic version of House of Cards.This one's a keeper.
B00CDBTQCW,Richard L Thompson,4,House of Cards was/is better.  This is not the best written series I've ever seen.  It needs better actors. OK?
B00CDBTQCW,Richard Newton,4,This is funny. It's taking a while to find what works on this show but they seem to be getting better as the series goes on. The Pilot was great but the 1st show wasn't even close. Then it picked back up. I have great expectations for this show.
B00CDBTQCW,Richard Siegmeister,3,If you are a fan of HBO's Veep you will definitely enjoy this show.  John Goodman is very funny and I most enjoyed the show when they were concentrating on his character.  Bill Murrary was hilarious.  If he comes back I a definitely going to watch.
B00CDBTQCW,Rock Fossil "wacowayne",4,Very good idea for a series but much of the humor from the development of the characters hit too close to the actual situation in congress today. Good selection of the actors.
B00CDBTQCW,Rockster12,5,This show is funny and entertaining. I would recommend watching it. It reminds me of house of cards from netflix but with more comedy in it.
B00CDBTQCW,Roy A Nelson Jr.,3,I could rate this higher in the end.  I've only watched the first two episodes.  Good acting.  Pretty good story so far.
B00CDBTQCW,Sabba Efie "retired PhD engineer",5,I really enjoyed Alpha House. I found the Senators hilarious. John Goodman makes the show &#34;ring&#34;. I'm looking forward to more episodes in the future. The John Goodman character has to be re-elected!!
B00CDBTQCW,Sadcelticlady,5,I love john goodman this series was made for him ! Cannot wait to see the new episodes ! Thank you for great programming !
B00CDBTQCW,Simon Sez,3,I live in DC...some of this is funny and all to real. Other  stuff...well not so much as it seems scripted  and Troudeau  knows better.
B00CDBTQCW,Ssloane,5,I REALLY love this show!  Very well cast --- Love John Goodman --- brings new insight to the political system in Washington D.C.  This show would be a major hit in any forum.
B00CDBTQCW,Stanley Cook,4,Of all the Amazon Originals I like this one the best.  It reminds me of A House Of Cards but the funny side.  This would be a series I could really sink my teeth into.  I look forward to watching the whole season.
B00CDBTQCW,Steve Lilly,4,Good fun stuff hits home with unnerving accuracy. Clever writing and a great cast deserve a wider audience. A week between episodes is hard to bear.
B00CDBTQCW,Susan D'Alessandro,4,It's a fun show.  It's funny enough to be entertaining but probably true enough to be scary!  I enjoy it.
B00CDBTQCW,TheDuke,4,I like the style and satire of this show. The acting is great and the writing is pretty decent. I also enjoy the fact that they use real politicians for points of reference instead of fake ones. I would strongly recommend this show to people that enjoy politics. Very well done and I look forward to more episodes in the future.
B00CDBTQCW,TheRaven,5,Congradulations to the writers of Alpha.  Good storyline very funny.  The x rated picture acidently posted by Louis's aid was hilarious and does he know his daughter is in a relationship or is he that dumb?  Reestablished my like for the Republican Party.
B00CDBTQCW,typo_kign,2,Feels like this is somewhere between West Wing and Veep; can't decide if it wants to be serious or funny and the compromise leaves it in limbo.
B00CDBTQCW,Virgil F. Keller,4,It seems timely with current events and it is funny. John Goodman really pulls another off.  The other cast are great also and emulate live senators currently serving in the Senate impeccably.
B00CDBTQCW,V. Pettus,5,This series is a hit!  The script is crisp and realistic; no annoying laugh tracks.  The characters are interesting and you will enjoy them as they relate to each other.  Highly recommend!
B00CDBTQCW,wayneit,5,The cast in this moves it right along. The  idea is strong and the humor is cleverly woven into the story.
B00CDBTQCW,Wolfgang "Film & TV",4,I'm at episode 4 now and the show actually seems to get better..... John Goodman is awesome of course.Looks very promising to me and could be a huge multi-year success .......
B00CDBTQCW,Xevin,5,I hope this show makes it to round 2. It was very good! Great laughs all the way through. I'm surprised this show was even a question for the green light. I can't wait to see the rest of it.
B00CDBTQCW,xloner12,4,The show had some great parts but it wasn't grand slam. I would love to see it get picked up and worked on. With the talent and cast the show should have a really good chance at finding a funny rhythm.
B00CDBTQCW,Y.L.C.,4,I really enjoyed watching this pilot despite the fact that I'm getting burnt out on political dramas and satires.  It was so good to see John Goodman and the handsome Clark Johnson! Did Clark direct this episode? The group of men was a good ensemble with great chemistry and humor.  It's kinda like the flip side of Netfix's "House of Cards".  Good show!
B00CDBTQCW,ziploid,3,Nice premise.  Good cast.  Characters need to be more likable. Less cursing. Characters need to be more family orientated-better representations of the Republican Party.
B00CDBTVM2,A-2-Z Enterprise,5,I'd watch this series.  Pretty funny. You have to laugh at the things that are actually happening in Washington anyway.
B00CDBTVM2,Alice M. Grove "The Little Harpist",5,This is the best spoof on Washington politics that I have ever seen.  The characters are almost over the top but that makes them so amusing.  The cast is top notch and they mimic situations we have all heard about in the news.  The characters also mimic those we all hear about on a day to day basis but the difference here is that you can laugh at them.  I am looking forward to the next season.
B00CDBTVM2,Amazon Customer "curling acs",5,Enjoyed it.  Hope there will be more shows.  John Goodman great as well as all the other actors in the show
B00CDBTVM2,Barb in Savannah,5,I liked the 3 episodes. It was cleaver and funny.  The cast is also outstanding.  I will be waiting for more...
B00CDBTVM2,Brick,5,Great cast and great first episode. Quality/entertaining television is hard to find on the networks. So far this show is really great.
B00CDBTVM2,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,so many great stars so many great characters and clark johnson even directs an episode!!! season 2 please. pretty please!!!
B00CDBTVM2,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",1,Just Hollywood 's way of caricaturing the way that think other people think. It becomes clear they think all Republicans are hypocrites and Idiots. But not the people they pick to be in the White House.
B00CDBTVM2,Daniel Cooper "dancoopermedia",1,Poorly written. Yet another show about political dolts in DC? No thanks. How about some sort of setup so we understand that congresspeople actually live together while their families stay back in their home states?
B00CDBTVM2,Debby Bright,4,It's hilarious!  John Goodman is in true form and the supporting actors are perfectly cast.  This show must be all the buzz...
B00CDBTVM2,Diverboston,5,I love this show. It's funny and sarcastic and the actors are great. But there were no new shows the past two weeks. Did they cancel the show?
B00CDBTVM2,Dusguicheon "Baer",5,I really enjoyed watching the first three shows and can't wait for more.  Much better than your average main stream TV fare. I hope Amazon Prime continues to produce this level of original programming.
B00CDBTVM2,Elizabeth Ansley,1,Stupid story line and stupid dialing what the heck would get this to the public? How desperate to fill air space!
B00CDBTVM2,Ernie Fordham,4,An interesting take on insider politics in DC with a lot of dry humor thrown in. Enjoyable viewing. John Goodman is at his best.
B00CDBTVM2,Faye P,4,I am a fan of John Goodman and Mark Consuelos. I watched the preview in the spring and indicated in the poll that I would watch the series if it was developed. I have enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd episodes and look forward to the rest of the series.
B00CDBTVM2,Frances I. Tucker "babybee",5,Funniest series ever....political or otherwise.  Garry Trudow really nailed it.  I hope there will be more seasons to come of this.
B00CDBTVM2,Greg Sylvester,5,Enjoyable funny amazon original comedy series- season1 is a nice quick watch and is recommend for all prime users to check out. Looking forward to season 2!
B00CDBTVM2,Happy Time,4,Epi9sodes are thought provoking and funny.  Love the cast.  As Always John Goodman proves to be  a versatile talent.  The entire cast works beautifully together.
B00CDBTVM2,J. Neuman,5,Great show. Hilarious pilot. I hope to see this for many years to come. AMAZON! KEEP THIS SHOW! it's perfect.
B00CDBTVM2,Joe 1015,5,I watched all the episodes. They were all funny. Well written and the acting is top notch. Great series from Amazon. Can't wait for the second season.
B00CDBTVM2,john mager,3,did not care for casting at all ther out put projection was very week made move une conconvincing. did not watch whole movie.
B00CDBTVM2,jrodie,1,If you want to watch a good show about the political scene in Wasington D.C. watch house of cards. This show is just a rip off House of cards on Netfix.  I'll keep watching house of cards this show was not worth watching
B00CDBTVM2,Kindle Customer "knitting hobby",3,Just like the liberal media it is an attack on republicans. I would love to see a show attacking and making fun of democrats. It is funny in some ways because all politicians are the same fakes out for there own interest. This show has a ring of truth about it and is funny but into laugh out loud funny.
B00CDBTVM2,Lee Lyte,5,I loved it. John Goodman anchors a strong cast.  Excellent acting by all. New & fresh premise.  Can't wait for more!
B00CDBTVM2,Lorraine Kozlowski,5,Great show that had me laughing out loud many times. Wonderful group of actors that work so well together. Looking forward so a Season 2!
B00CDBTVM2,Martin,3,No match for Homeland or Lost or Alias.  John Goodman plays his always up to snuff role as does the PA Senator. The other 2 leads are so-so; but enjoyable never the less.
B00CDBTVM2,Morgan Harris,1,Don't waste your time.  It is not funny.  All the jokes are political.  The script is clearly written about one political party by the other.
B00CDBTVM2,Myrna I McKnight,1,Did not enjoy this one. We just finished West Wing and thought this would be just as enjoyable but couldn't stand to watch more than three episodes.
B00CDBTVM2,North Texas Girl,1,Update: I have to laugh at the people who found this review "not helpful." They think everyone has to agree with them.  Still don't want Hollywood imposing their political views on everyone.If this show took on both political parties I might have watched more than 15 minutes of it. I don't want politics in the shows I watch.
B00CDBTVM2,PoohBearsf,5,My husband and I really enjoy this show and look forward to the second season. I like the dynamic between all the characters as well as their individual stories.
B00CDBTVM2,R Brownfield,4,Well acted and funny but content is just more political bashing. Worth watching but not one of my favorite shows.  John Goodman terrific in his role.
B00CDBTVM2,Richard R,5,I like this show because it gives a look at Washington DC from a unique view and perspective.I would recommend that this show continues.
B00CDBTVM2,Sashin,5,John Goodman is great.  Imminently watchable.  Pertinent story lines.  Good chemistry between actors.  Want to see more and hope this pilot is picked up.
B00CDBTVM2,Sissy Kirsteen,1,I am sure that I would have enjoyed this series but did not get through the first episode before switching off due to the awful language.  Surely these men could be expected to have a larger vocabulary.  All in all I was very disappointed and would not recommend anyone to watch the series.
B00CDBTVM2,Teddy and Me "JLEE",1,Very &#34;frat house&#34;. Could be &#34;Animal House&#34; for the middle aged. Didn't really like it. Not for every audience for sure.
B00CDBTVM2,t,5,The cast is tremendously funny!  Script writing is superior!  I really like this series!  Can't wait to see more!  Bravo!
B00CDBTVM2,Walter Orlandini,3,Not humorous. Not realistic. Hard to follow
B00CDCXZWI,babs,5,Very good movie.  However it does make one wonder if such terrible thugs continue their violence when jailed.  Nice ending.
B00CDCXZWI,Carol B. Johnson "Sasha's mama",4,Thought provoking. Well acted movie. I love the unusual relationship these characters had. Very interesting story. It was touching how much the postcards meant to each of them.
B00CDCXZWI,Crafts lover.,1,I found that it was a very depressing story with no real message or meaning. Hated it. Will not even try to watch any other movies by this director.
B00CDCXZWI,Don Montgomery,5,I worked for some time in a State Penitentiary and jail films are usually over done one way or another. Not this one. Guy Pierce was stupendous. This Chinese girl stole my heart and the solicitor who went to bat for both was terrific. The ending was true to form without being sappy. Well done collaboration of two continents.
B00CDCXZWI,Donna L. Sako,3,The movie was good but the story kinda dragged me down. It was a but depressing but it might have just been me. The acting was superb.
B00CDCXZWI,Doug Lowe,4,A little bit fairy tailish but very refreshing and uplifting. Guy Pearce did a good job as usual. THe movie leaves you with a good feeling.
B00CDCXZWI,Jacqueline A. Boyce "jack4102",3,THIS IS AND ODD STORY BUT WHAT IS EVEN ODDER IS THAT I WANTED TO SEE IT THORUGH TO THE END.  I LIKED IT EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT IT WAS SAD.  I HAVE A HABIT OF WATCHING THE RATHER ODD STORYLINE MOVIES.
B00CDCXZWI,Marshaleigh,3,I adore Guy Pierce so I had to see this.  He does a fair job but all the other actors are just so so. There are touching moments but the story is not too surprising.  All in all I give it an .o.k rating. I wanted it to be much more.
B00CDCXZWI,RB,2,I like Guy Pierce. I feel for the plight of the orphan. But the premise just didn't pull me in. Pierce is usually connected with good films but the awful start to this one doesn't offer anything to pull the viewer into the story.  Enough said.
B00CDCXZWI,Redbanks,5,I too enjoyed this simple sweet movie.  Nice performances from the adults and the children.  Guy Pierce is always good and even better as a native Australian...
B00CDCXZWI,todd,4,this was just a standard movie it was there but really not there it had showed some action and adventure but the movie was ok
B00CDU5MBC,Dave,5,She is one of the funniest comics out there today.  I should know since I am an expert laugher.  Ha Ha
B00CDU5MBC,Duc Nguyen,4,You ever laugh and then realize that you really shouldn't be laughing.  Yeah its that kind of show.
B00CDU5MBC,gary blakely,1,not my cup of tea.....nothing really more to say about it ..some will like it some wont..l just try and then delete if you dont like it
B00CDU5MBC,gregg dunn,4,I love her raunchy humor. the show is edgy and laugh out loud funny.I'd Bang Amy !! Recommend highly.
B00CDU5MBC,ilikebooks,4,She is really funny but a little too much sex.  I like the segment at the end when there is an interview.
B00CDU5MBC,IMHO "IMHO",1,Trust me 30 seconds is more than this is worth.Don't bother watching this.it's garbage and filthy and a sad commentary on our society
B00CDU5MBC,John N,5,Amy's show is one of the funniest that I have seen in years.  She's willing to draw her comedy from the darkest corners and that's an enormous talent.
B00CDU5MBC,jpwhel,4,This is a very funny comedian. Some of the skits are are a bit silly and raunchy but overall a very good watch.
B00CDU5MBC,Kathleen M Thomas,4,This show cracked me up. I found myself watching several episodes at a time.  Certainly not for everyone. Certainly not for younger viewers.
B00CDU5MBC,kwolgast,4,Making skits from some of the stories in her standup make the skits even funnier with her delivery. Great first season.
B00CDU5MBC,Lorri Robinson,5,Amy doesn't shy away from the tough stuff in her comedy.  I would like to see more.  I will be looking for a second season.
B00CDU5MBC,Peter Geoghegan,4,Funny chick
B00CDU5MBC,Peyton W.,5,Funny as hell! Amy Schumer is as hot as she is funny!! You will enjoy if you like offbeat sketch comedy
B00CDU5MBC,shane molitor,2,Slow and not overly funny. Segment clips are as long as the comedy clips.
B00CE0ZW9I,Gigi123,3,Thus show is really cute...just a lot of toddler animals going through &#34;situations&#34;.  The claymation is great...but it's kinda annoying that they only talk in animals sounds even though animals don't really talk lol.  But my son enjoys it and no violence so it's ok.
B00CE0ZW9I,M. Engel,5,It so cute. How adorable the little lamb with the pacy. Thinking hard and emotions that cross his mind. Just cute.
B00CE0ZW9I,norma jean kringer,5,Made for younger crowds but still cute enough to watch with the kids without getting bored.  Shawn the sheep is still my favorite.
B00CE10AP8,Arthur Gooch,5,timmy rules !  she will watch this any time she can.would give timmy a 10 over 5 if i could
B00CE10AP8,Fannie Tillman,5,This is a good show..  I love it!  And the kids should like it.  Very very very good show. Excellent
B00CE10BD4,Ant C,5,Good family fun. Who needs dialogue when you have this flock of characters. So round up your herd for shear joy
B00CE10BD4,BL,5,We enjoy relaxing with Shaun the Sheep.  It has witty humor and is always a delight.  My grandson likes the music that accompanies it and gets excited when I let him watch one.
B00CE10BD4,Cathy,5,All of the Shaun the Sheep stories are great. The episodes are for everyone who enjoys a good laugh. The farmer and his girlfriend are so spot on - You just know something is going to go wrong!
B00CE10BD4,Cortney Yonker,5,Our 5 year old loves these sheep! She is always laughing and loves to sing along with the theme song.
B00CE10BD4,diannerae,4,Shaun the sheep is dry humour like most English comedy. The animation is good. It's not slap your knee silly but it has good story plots for farm animals.
B00CE10BD4,exwyzee8,5,Me and my daughter love to watch this show. No matter how many times we watch it its still funny. The small baby sheep is Timmy and he has is own show called Timmy Time which is so very funny and very cute.
B00CE10BD4,Fannie Tillman,5,One time my family watch it All together  and they like it very much... It's a great show for family time
B00CE10BD4,Gram,5,My Grandson loves Shaun the Sheep. It is a very cute show that little ones like. As Grandma I think it is a fun show .
B00CE10BD4,jean h.,5,Love these adorable sheep.  The series is very clever and our grandsons love them as well.  We all enjoy laughing.
B00CE10BD4,Kathy,5,My grandkids love this!  They actually giggle when watching it.  This is one of their favorites to watch on the Kindle.
B00CE10BD4,Lanfranco,5,I Like The Way That Shaun Is Very Creative Because I Am The Same And The Cartoon Itself Is So Funny.
B00CE10BD4,Larry Parker,5,Ever since Wallace And Grommit I've watch almost everything that comes out of Ardman studios. I have not been disappointed.
B00CE10BD4,Lurch,5,Awsome shawn is the best of the best.  Harpo Marx would be proud.  Do you want to laugh and not have to think but just enjoy this is the show for you.  Keep it up guys this is great.
B00CE10BD4,Lynda Norton "Highland Enthusiast",5,I discovered Shaun the Sheep as I was looking for something fun for my grandson to watch and we love Claymation productions.  This is the cutest program that I watch it when my grandson isn't visiting!
B00CE10BD4,mari franks,3,I guess this type of cartoon or animation is not my 5 year old songs favorite. He didn't care to watch any more of these.
B00CE10BD4,mbyers,5,Boys think it is cool! Lots of funny laughs! Good for the whole family! Silly cartoon sheep  in a barnyard!
B00CE10BD4,Sudsy,5,Grandchildren  loved watching this with their grandfather.They are twins who are nine years old&#8230;a boy and a girl.Belly laughs and lot of smiles.
B00CE10BD4,Susan "Susan",5,Riotously funny stories that kids love and adults enjoy!
B00CEHMFUK,Dental hygienist mom,5,Very cute and well thought out cartoon. Goes over everyday trials and tribulations of being a preschooler. Our three year old loves it.
B00CEHMFUK,Fannie Tillman,5,Timmy time is like Shaun the sheep  but it has the baby sheep and I like that show very very much that's good a good show...
B00CEHMFUK,Melissa,5,This show is the only one that my 2-year-old likes! We are so happy that it is available to stream through Amazon!
B00CEHMFUK,SC,4,The kids love it and it can be mildly amusing. No real value to it but the animation looks like claymation and some of the story lines are funny
B00CFVNL94,Diane R.,4,its a very good show but it probably wont have a second season I doubt mtv will renew it.  there is a well thought out plot that carry over from one episode to the next.
B00CFVNL94,James Westervelt,3,I get a kick out of his energy and naive approach to life. His antics are fun and make me smile.
B00CFVNL94,Jamie,3,This comedy isn't very funny generally I deleted it from my watch list after a few episodes. It didn't work for me.....perhaps if I was younger?
B00CGFHCRQ,CHUCOTIME,5,at the same time.Pretty informing and kept you glued to the storyline and intrigued!Awesome display of popular hippie culture from the 60's/70's
B00CGUCACI,Alex Ross,5,Waht can you say about Mythbusters.aways great!. even teh reruns are fun!My son & I will watch again & again
B00CGUCACI,Bazajaytee "Bazajaytee",4,According to Wikipedia of Mythbusters there were 12 episodes in Season 14 not the 11 that Amazon show as available. Traffic Tricks appears to be missing from Amazon Instant Video which came as the episode before the Breaking Bad Special and after Painting with Explosives/Bifurcated Boat.
B00CGUCACI,Rextafier,5,This is a great show for kids and adults. I hope this becomes the longest made tv show. My kids have an awsome time watching
B00CGUCACI,Ronault D. Trowbridge,4,I watched this for the Breaking Bad episode. Kind of sad that the fulminated mercury & hydrochloric acid scenes wouldn't work the way they did for Walter White. It was hilarious to see Vince Gilligan try to talk his way around his busted myths. Doesn't matter though I'll always love the Breaking Bad episodes that were Myth Busted.
B00CGUPNY0,meg,4,There's no denying the physical evidence was scientifically evident. It's crazy that the spirits of the boys are there. If not theirs then somebody else's spirits are there.
B00CGUPNY0,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",4,This show is a lot of fun and always interesting.  Sometimes you gotta go &#34;huh&#34; at some of the &#34;evidence&#34; - like the demon face that just happens to appear in a light spot on a digital photo - but that's part of the fun of it.  In with the stories that are just so lame are some really good ghost stories sand videos of stuff that makes you wonder about whether there are really hauntings.
B00CHIM1OG,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",5,A-ha ha ha. Bet no one ever thought of that one Mark. A-ha ha ha.But seriously a quality show right up there with Louis. Not quite but up there.Some of the themes really hit home for me.
B00CHIM1OG,D. Mark Waldoch "Mark the Guitar Teacher",5,This and the first episode are familiar to those who are ardent listeners to his WTF podcast. It is a nice combination of humor and sentiment. Can't wait for more.
B00CHU542K,Claudine,5,My son adores this show. He watches it everyday while I make dinner. It is so cute and teaches kids to be curious but also to always fix your messes.
B00CHU542K,romansjoy,5,This show keeps my 3 year old entertained daily.  We've watched them over and over again and she can't seem to get enough.
B00CHVPEEW,Janice E. Garver,3,I was looking for a scary movie. This had a strange outcome. I would have voted for a different male to play the main actor.
B00CHVPEEW,Viva,1,Is this really all that Coppola can do anymore?  This is hardly a story and it wastes Elle Fanning completely.  Something about a writer and the ghost of Poe and a haunting.  You can barely follow it and it is dull as well.
B00CI14OV0,babydoc,5,When I was young I remember watching Teen Titans and I was sad that it only lasted for 5 seasons.This new version is my daughters favorite show and I hope lasts for a long time.Its a show I enjoy to watch with her.
B00CK3SHY6,Pamela Burdett,5,Powerful documentary and a timely one too!  Art history buffs should see this.Provenance researchers would thoroughly enjoy it.Great film.
B00CKJQVSE,curlygirl,5,Our entire family enjoys watching this show together and my kids are more eager to try new foods as a result.
B00CKJQVSE,D,5,I really enjoy season 10 of Chopped. It has become one of my favorite shows. I really enjoyed the tournament.
B00CKJQVSE,Jacob Crampton,5,I love this show wish every season was on prime. It is interesting to see what they make. Watch it.
B00CKJQVSE,KEN,5,Enjoy the series with all the up coming chefs who want and do make a name for themselves.. Also like the championships.  seeing what 4 chefs can do with mystery products is great.
B00CKJQVSE,Lurch,5,Here is a show that is always new and fun.  I am not a cook but the challenge and fun of seeing peaple work with items I wouldn't even touch is great.  Give it a try you wont be let down.
B00CKJQVSE,Melinda H. Hansen "MS Warrior",5,Lots of great episodes.  Amazing how this show stays so fresh.  The mystery baskets are strangely unique and much fun to view the thought process of how to use these ingredients.  An education in world-wide cuisine.
B00CLE9WHK,Joan,3,Keeps me wondering if she will get through it without breaking the bank.I haven't watched enough to give a very good review. Sorry!Joan M.
B00CLE9WHK,Mystery Iris "Mystery Iris",5,I love this show. Nicole does demolition and rehabilitation of historically valuable houses bringing them back to their &#34;glory&#34; days. She is not just another pretty face.
B00CLE9WHK,N. Foley,5,Enjoyed the progression of the project over time vs. one quick show around the rehab project. Got my interest and creative juices flowing what more could you ask for in a tv program? Thank you for offering this great show.
B00CLE9WHK,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,Great I used to work for a co.  that did rehab for banks &private owners  I was really surprised at what it looked like when I came back in a a few weeks to see the transformation of a dump to a castle!!!!!
B00CLE9WHK,Sandra Seebers "Avid Reader",5,I liked this addictive show so much I bought season two! I had to find out if she sells the Minnehaha house.
B00CNB2UKW,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",3,Better written series than most medieval stories. I would recommend this if you are board and want to wast some time.
B00CNB2UKW,Hotmess,5,THIS IS A SHOW THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! I JUST WISH THAT PRIME MEMBERS DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NEXT SEASONS!! HINTS THE WORD PRIME.....
B00CNB2UKW,michael kallal,5,Loved Merlin from the very beginning.  Too bad the series had to end. I would be in favor of more.
B00CNB2UKW,Victoria R. Brown,5,I have watched this show from the beginning and hate that this is its last season.  The story ended strangely.  But well worth watching.
B00CO0DUYM,L J Johnston,5,My grandchildren love this show & learn so much about animals from watching it. They can tell me facts I never knew!
B00CO0DUYM,penlight,5,still awesome at vol4. my kids love wild kratts and learn tons every time they watch it. the kratt brothers are very energetic and enthusiastic. listening to them makes you feel happy.this and curious george i could let my kids watch all day long.
B00CO0DUYM,razrbax5280,5,I am so glad we stumbled upon this series. My kids love animals and the show blends educational and entertainment content effortlessly.  I actually enjoy sitting with them and watching it.... learning new things as well!
B00CO0DUYM,Winston M. Gonzalez,4,great learning tools for the kids my kids love wild krats and I can see why they are hooked on it.  tons of learning for them!!!
B00CO0KMW0,Nick,5,the crew behind this documentary never cease to amaze me. one jaw dropping special after another. this is a must see
B00CO0KMW0,Stormy,5,Amazing cinematography and incredibly informative. Would recommend for all ages. Startlingly beautiful hows about the amazing wildlife of North America. No foreign safari needed - just travel the US!
B00CO0LI5U,Amazon Customer "castor833",4,I am looking forward to how this gets wrapped up. Michael and company have some obstacles to overcome and I will not be surprised if there comes some personal sacrifices.
B00CO0LI5U,Ariel Miller,5,It's unique in it's own right and fun if you like the style.  I often wonder how Michael Weston will explain the reason behind why the action goes down.  It's fun to be a part of the narration.
B00CO0LI5U,Benjamin West,5,Best show ever; I mean ever.  Will miss watching Burn Notice.They don't make them like this anymore.  Spies a bunch of bitchy little girls.........
B00CO0LI5U,Carl Gillberg &#34;Kamaka&#34; "Carl Gillberg",5,All good things must end.  7 seasons of getting burned was probably enough... Nice job cast and crew.  OUr Hero's go off into the sunset happily ever after.
B00CO0LI5U,D. Barabino,5,I have watched every episode of this show from first season to the last one in the 7th season.  USA Network has a gaping hole in its line-up since Burn Notice has ended. I liked all of the characters regular and guest. I kind of hope that they would periodically do a tv movie or two.
B00CO0LI5U,Dean W. Wood,5,As always a stellar season of Burn Notice. I really did like the ending especially with the lines from the first show being used. And the ending for Michael's mom was so Maddy. Love it and will miss it.
B00CO0LI5U,diamonds,5,burn notice is one of favor tv shows glace is have a final show.  i have all the others seasons
B00CO0LI5U,D. Light,3,Michael's character background turns out not to be as strong interesting or as deep as I had hoped. All the other characters faded into the background as well. Mistake. Those relationships are what kept me watching. Finale was pretty good though.
B00CO0LI5U,edith banes,5,I had gotten bored with the last couple of seasons.  With this being the last one I thought I'd check it out.  And it's really good.  Coming to be a good send off however it ends.
B00CO0LI5U,Elizabeth Bailey,5,Intriging and captivating.  Kept my interest and would continue to watch more episodes.  It was easy to download and watch via Amazon unbox.
B00CO0LI5U,helenredhawk,4,I loved this show but the direction the show has taken in the new season seems very dark and there isn't as much interaction with all of the main characters. Most of the scenes are with Michael in extremely bad situations. I hope the writers will bring this extreme darkness to a resolution soon.
B00CO0LI5U,Johanna Wiese,5,The ending is quite surprising and am glad they ended it the way they did... More Burn Notice please.... Maybe a spin off with Jesse and Sam??
B00CO0LI5U,Mary Ceparano,5,I have all seven seasons. They are all great. Don' like how the series ended. Sorry to see it end. Will miss it.
B00CO0LI5U,mgp,4,Have watched 7 seasons and so looked forward til the the last few when violence over-ran! The Last 5 minutes wrapped all the reasons to have believed  in sticking with it til the end. Evil grew too much- as was intended- with each season!
B00CO0LI5U,MVP,5,Great end to the show. I've seen every single episodes of this TV series and just LOVE the way it ended. Kuddos to the producers
B00CO0LI5U,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),2,When I saw the start of this once entertaining series it was exciting and entertaining but the last two seasons have become sadly the weakest for this once entertaining series. I still find the cast enjoyable and some of the episodes and action is still decent but the plot and finale for the final season was the most weakest written from the writers of the series and sadly left me with more annoyance on the series ending then any sort of satisfaction.I understand the writers and producers felt the need to wrap up the last season quickly but that has become their fault on making this season the least liked out of the entire series run.So if you already have the previous seasons I say stick with those and just forget the seventh and sadly least entertaining season you won't be missing much.
B00CO0LI5U,Riley Harper,5,I'm sad this is the last year of Burn Notice. I enjoy this tv show so much and have watched it since it started. I will miss it and recommend this GREAT entertaining tv show because the characters are like family and will miss having them in my living room after the end of this final season!
B00CO0LI5U,RPC,5,This is a great series I have watched over and over. Great story line and plenty of action  Sorry to see it go
B00CO0LI5U,Rugby,3,This show was great but ducks now same week after week. Its the writing the actors are giving ut their best poor things. When Fiona's tells Michael to end this we can only all agree.
B00CO0LI5U,Steven T. "Steve",5,I love this show.  I have all the seasons.  They are fun to watch even if you have seen them before.  Burn Notice is a keeper.
B00CO0LNIM,Amazon Customer,5,I adore this show.. I'd never make the type of under cover work. great show and so happy I can see it on amazon..hulu takes too long to keep up my jones to see this show!!
B00CO0LNIM,Debbie Dillon,3,I didn't care for this show all that much. The acting is fine but I just couldn't get into it. Might watch it again at a later time but not now.
B00CO0LNIM,Ebele Oraghalum,5,For real? Awesome...always waiting to see the next episode. Hope season 2 returns. Please give it a chance. Dont cancel it...
B00CO0LNIM,Gayle A Matthews,4,I enjoyed this new drama series.  The ensemble works well together and there is lots of action and twists and turns.  The series did so well that FOX is going forward with the 2nd season.
B00CO0LNIM,Gloria Lyons,4,Liked all the agents living in the lovely house on the beach.  Good cast of characters.  I will watch a second season if there is one.
B00CO0LNIM,SoCal Mom,3,good story line .. but hard to follow.. will stick with it tho' to see what happens.. pretty dark...good choice of characters...
B00CO0LNRS,Artemis,1,total disappointment . we were hard core fans and we can't figure out what happened with the writing. the turned Fiona and Madelin into whiny simply tear annoying women.  those were my favorite characters before.
B00CO0LNRS,Chris Schoenrock,5,Amazing Show. They have tried to reproduce it but yet. The show has gotten better every season and for their final season this may be the best yet.
B00CO0LNRS,Cristina Hiatt,5,The quality of the video and audio are great.  I don't have cable so this is a great way to catch up on what you miss DURING the season...Not waiting for Netflix to have it on DVD.  And this season is so gritty.  It's killing me that michael and fi are apart after they got together last season. And the THINGS Michael has to do!
B00CO0LNRS,Gerrob,5,Michael still refers to Fiona as his girlfriend during the opening sequence. Either Michael is going through denial or the writers and producers of the show are too lazy to update the opening sequence.Maybe we could look forward to a Burn Notice movie someday where the people behind the scenes put a little effort into the project. "It might be great" (said with a Jesse impression).
B00CO0LNRS,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",4,This series really &#34;Jumped the Shark&#34; as it were but the final episode was worth it. I would recommend it if you are attached the character development. The reason for the high rating was strictly based on the last episode.
B00CO0LNRS,SoCal Mom,3,not keen on current plot lines.. but still a good story amid the summer dearth...not much else to choose from in the summer offerings.. pretty dreary and predictable.. some really bad!
B00CO0LNRS,TammyZ,5,I'm sorry to see that this will be the final season.  I will surely miss the show and the characters.  You have to see the show from Season One.TammyZ
B00CQ1UXN0,Dstress,2,Really was disappointed with this film. The crazy rapists on the loose theme that came up was lame and laughable. A couple of the death scenes were well done but I thought it could of been much better.
B00CRWORX0,Joseph J Mallory,1,I put this movie on to see all the beautiful scenery and all I got was a chance to see more people talking about nothing. If I had wanted to hear people talking about nothing I could have tuned to most sitcoms that come on these days.
B00CRWPGQ2,1farstar,1,Apparently everyone involved with making of this film also rated it.  Very sad and transparent effort. Waste of my time.
B00CRWPGQ2,azjmw,1,really bad mash up of every bad genre stereotype and cliche put in a bland story that has no spark whatsoever.
B00CRWPGQ2,neon,3,This Movie was entertaining with good twists and turns the actors and actresses seemed very good together. easy to Watch to the End
B00CRWPGQ2,Ron Baker,3,This film is a crime drama with a bit of supernatural and horror thrown in. Acting and cinematography is pretty good and the crime story isn't bad.
B00CU71AY6,boto,1,The movie overall was disappointing. Just the way that it was portrayed then how it played out was not at all good. It was ok.
B00CU71AY6,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",2,Admittedly did not watch it all the way through.  What I did watch did not interest me.  Maybe it is a good movie just not to me.
B00CU71AY6,Diva,2,Horrible acting mixed with a stupid story line made for hilarity in this supposed horror movie. I do not recommend this unless you want a good laugh with a disappointing end.
B00CU71AY6,movie lover "jean",3,It was pretty good somewhat scary but still not one of the ones I would want to see again. Sorry
B00CU71AY6,Stephan A. Miller,2,For as long as I watched it was mostly a one woman monolog. I got bored watching her react to noises in the background and talking to herself.
B00CVMGQLC,Amazon Customer,5,I saw this at the theatre when it first came out. It was a very informative look at the problems and pressures that DFD face on a daily basis. Definitely a must see. Highly recommended.
B00CVMGQLC,Hotmess,3,MY HUSBAND IS A FIREFIGHTER AND JUST HAD TO SEE IT!! IT WAS OK BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT FIREFIGHTING YOUR KINDA LOST.
B00CW842PM,Jacqui Hawkins,1,This show seemed like something that would be right up my alley....it just falls flat in my opinion. I've already removed from my watchlist.
B00CW842PM,John C Miller,3,The show had a good premise if some what corny.  I believe the one thing that killed the show is the same thing that causes many of these shows to be cancelled is that they insist on bringing in Phyco's  I mean physic's the great majority of people do not believe in  these con artist whose only purpose is to relieve the foolish from their money.
B00CW842PM,robert e. burrow,4,This show is interesting and provides a lot of history and information on the items.  The people are very colorful with eccentric personalities vet entertaining.
B00CW842PM,techie mike,4,I could totally see how people into these types of &#34;dark&#34; items could get into this show....  I was pulled in and had to watch the whole season in one sitting.  I enjoyed it!
B00CW87CFO,Brian Parks "A man like any other. Only more so.",5,The boys never fail to surprise and delight. Is delight the word? It's all very weird and full of tropes and memes and other 21st centry blather. Just in a very good way. Very funny.
B00CW87CFO,pops95b,4,I am enjoying the show so far this season but its not quite as funny as the seasons before. I think they are falling into the trap of trying to make a comedy a drama.
B00CW88HXK,Cameron Tarantino,5,This season may have been the best...  We enjoy watching Zak make a fashion statement and the other two puppy behind him.  Nick seems poised to get possessed at every turn this season.  Never disappointed with this series.  Zak is obviously autistic...
B00CW88HXK,Cynthia,3,Love how these guys stumble around finding folks from the other side.  This particular &#34;volume&#34; was too technical.  Get real guys and leave the checklist to your grocery shopping.
B00CW88HXK,Debra Cook,5,This show gets better each time we watch it.  We have seen a few things that really make you jump!  I would recommend this show to anyone who likes spooky things.  I hope this show stays on the air for a long time.  I know we'll be watching it.
B00CW88HXK,Jessica Balyeat,4,The more I watch these guys the more I like them!  Seem too get to investigate some great locations and always get some great evidence.
B00CW88HXK,Leo Hott,5,I love all things related to cryptozoology & the paranormal if you are likewise interested I am sure you will enjoy this season of Ghost Adventures.
B00CW8CHNQ,MS,4,This is a movie about the German atrocities in the death camps and leading to them in Germany and Poland. It is a well acted documentary. Hard to believe that so much hatred against a race could exist.
B00CW8CJHK,Larry,5,shows part of what it takes to survive off the land. determination and self reliance some of the things our country was built upon
B00CW8CJHK,Rock N Rob,5,Me and my daughter love the show. Makes us want to move up there and live the good life. Everything we eat or drink or breath is killing us in the lower 48. Got a kick out of Jane's reaction to the grizzly coming down to catch salmon for dinner with them. Would have scared me too. Especially without a gun. Don't forget the gun when you're fishing along side grizzlies in Alaska! We love watching them catch salmon and shoot bears. Wish I could find a woman like Eve or Jane. They're so lucky to be up there. Great show. We have the season pass. R&R
B00CW8CJHK,Spider "spider",5,One of the better reality shows.  I feel like I know them.  Real life people and situations you can't imagine  dealing with yourself.  I find the life they live without so many things we rely on absolutely fascinating.  It has made me realize that so many things aren't really important and I've actually changed some of my own habits!
B00CW8CTWU,ellison,3,Jake tries to pass himself off as a college student in Indonesa. When a bomb goes off apparently killing a local princess the police want to ask Jake some questions. Soon it becomes a 'Fish out of Water/Buddy flick and Jake and Ash (the policeman) aspire to figure out what is going on.
B00CW8CWOA,Neal "MerlinFL",5,All the Top Shot shows are great and the All-Star season is the best as it takes out all the internal politics and just leaves it up to the abilities and luck of each highly skilled contestant.  Make more show like this such as Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls (sp?).  Another excellent REAL reality show.
B00CW8CWOA,Roger J. Buffington,5,Top Shot is one of the great reality TV shows and my son and I have enjoyed all of the past seasons.  This new season has a new format with less interpersonal drama and more emphasis on marksmanship and physical skills/fitness of the contestants.  There is no nomination range and thus no "politics" between the contestants.  The first episode was very enjoyable and gives Top Shot fans assurance that this is going to be a great season!  RJB.
B00CXI81J4,Amazon Customer,5,Best season thus far! No spoilers here ! Love the addition of the twins and the last episode was amazing best line "I WAS ALWAYS ALPHA!!!!"
B00CXI81J4,Amazon Customer,5,Still loving this show. The plot is evolving in a really interesting way and I'm really looking forward to the next season.
B00CXI81J4,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",5,Teen wolf season 3 got better than the other 2 seasons.  I would love to see what else happens I think it is addicting to watch
B00CXI81J4,babydoc,4,I love this show because of the hot guys and exciting Plot twists.I'm glad it was on Amazon prime so I can catch up with the seasons.
B00CXI81J4,boto,5,I enjoy this show so much that I watched the whole season in 2 days. Now I'm stuck waiting for the next season.
B00CXI81J4,briana tarango "Briana Tarango",4,I like it.  Ian Bohen plays Peter was awesome at the end when he said I always have been alpha.  Was cool when he said that.
B00CXI81J4,Chris NYC,5,With all the new werewolf/vampire television shows making their way to TV this is one worth checking out. Lot's of action and the theme keeps you engaged.
B00CXI81J4,Crystal Jackson,5,This season was filled with a wonderful storyline.  I enjoyed the fact that some more secrets were revealed to key characters.  The storyline actually gave helpful information about the past and how the characters are interconnected to one another.  The back story about the town gave more on an insight that made the idea of werewolves more plausible.  The action was unbeatable this season.  One of the best shows on the television.  Definitely worth watching.
B00CXI81J4,JLH4,5,Excellent script and the characters have grown.  Especially after seeing a recap within the season.  I was hooked from the beginning.
B00CXI81J4,K. A. Morgan "book relisher",5,I like it.  The characters are great.  Their mythology is consistent and there are surprises around every corner.  It is definitely fast paced.  Never boring.
B00CXI81J4,Kathryn M Guffey,5,It is great! I enjoy the werewolf and vampire shows where they are trying to live in both the supernatural world and the normal world we all live in and especially young people at stages in their lives that all of us find difficult and unsettling. Their bonds and loyalties may start differently but essentially they are all forged from the same thing and that is trust and the desire to survive.
B00CXI81J4,Marlena,5,This is just a fantastic show that keeps you on your toes and always coming up with new intrigues motives.
B00CXI81J4,Mary E. Henry "Sci-fi fan",4,Teen Wolf in it's third year is getting better and better. The first half of season 3 is great. Although the second half of year 3 is not as well done as previous episodes.
B00CXI81J4,MickeyT "MickeyT",5,This is the ONLY reason to watch MTV. Each season gets better and sexier with such a hot hot cast involved in great story lines.
B00CXI81J4,MMORPGr,5,I just think it's really a good show that keeps getting better.  It is great that I can watch past seasons on Amazon as I often see things I missed before.
B00CXI81J4,Paula,4,I like the scenes and the actors in this show. Kinda scary but good scenes. Will watch for more shows.
B00CXI81J4,Paul Baker "Pavlo",5,This get five stars because it kept us on the edge of our seats through the entire episode. Afterwards I would just shake my head and say what a clever show.
B00CXI81J4,rm,5,here is another show i watch on a regular basics that i hate we have to pay for which is not in the line up with the rest of the free tv apps to watch. Again i love this show and i am mad when i miss it so i do pay for it because it is a great show!
B00CXI81J4,Robert Becker,5,This is the BEST season yet!!  EVERYONE from the actors to the writers of this show have done an awesome job!!!
B00CY92YHW,Duffer513,4,Saw the original Band of Brothers and this addendum puts a face on some of the other characters.  Good profile of many heroic people!
B00CY92YHW,Watch Lady,4,I would highly recommend this historical account of World War II . We should never forget why we went to war and never forget our soldiers.
B00CY9YE66,Hpsweet,5,How can you NOT LOVE Ramsay and Joe!?!!!!! It is fun to watch the new recipes unfold on the show as well.
B00CY9YE66,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",1,This cooking show is cattle call style like the &#34;idol&#34; type shows.  So tired of weird people and weird ingredients.  Once again I appreciate the cooks on pbs (bless you Julia wherever you are) who actually taught us something about food and cooking.
B00CY9YE66,Phyllis DeSio,5,Love watching this show... Surprise it is still  the  Top 6 - Waiting for the final of the show view
B00CZ5P2HY,Athena,5,With Season 5 on air why isn't Amazon providing it for purchase day after it airs as they have in the past?
B00CZ5P2HY,Coco,5,It has it's moments.  Worth the watch. Good casting and for the most part good acting. I enjoyed it a lot.
B00CZ5P2HY,M. Naidas,4,The series is tarting to get interesting. May have to move on to some other series like Chicago Fire. Hope this season is better.
B00CZ5P2HY,Monaghan "ReMo",5,Truly one of the best shows out there!  Rookie Blue puts Grey's Anatomy to shame in ever sense of the word
B00CZ5P2HY,Patricia Wollweber,5,Love Sam and Andy. I wish they would get together and stay together.  I also wish they would make it a fall show instead of a summer show so we would get more episodes of it per season.
B00CZ5P2HY,Perry,5,I had to watch an episode I missed b/c of a baseball game interfering with the regular broadcast and this show is so good I couldn't skip an episode and had to watch it. We have watched every episode of this show and we love it.
B00CZ5P2HY,Zig Meyer,5,...and I got hooked and had to get all the back seasons too!  It's like Grey's Anatomy with more shooting.
B00D11SN22,R. Hartley "Writer's Mind",2,I was pretty sure it was before I even started watching it. My daughter talked me into it so we watched it. I started reading a book about halfway through.
B00D11SN22,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,I was hoping for a scientific treatment of the theory but this is completely fake and a waste of money: http://www.snopes.com/photos/supernatural/mermaids.asp
B00D1N6OQ2,AlwaysWatching,5,Definitely my favorite show on TV!Love this show! The way Longmire says soo little and yet soo much ...wonderfully acted.
B00D1N6OQ2,Amazon Customer "Skipper",5,Great characters right out of the heart of small town Wyoming.  This series as well as Justified have become two of our favorites
B00D1N6OQ2,BDI "Book reviewer",5,The second season is even more entertaining than the first.  The plot thickens around the characters who try to hide their secrets.
B00D1N6OQ2,Benjamin West,5,This show makes me want to move to the quite of Wyoming even though a lot of people seem to get killed.  The show is great.
B00D1N6OQ2,carl,5,We enjoyed the first two seasons and will enjoy the third and fourth as well.  We hope we will have more to come.Thank youThe Crosbys
B00D1N6OQ2,Cheryl,5,This is one of my favorite show. The second season did not disappoint. I cannot wait until season three gets here.
B00D1N6OQ2,Chris W,5,Beautiful landscapes and rugged people.  Very much enjoy the Native American perspective being a big part of the show and challenges of 2 cultures clashing
B00D1N6OQ2,clothesmaven "clothesmaven",5,I missed a &#34; good western &#34; on tv...but now we have LONGMIRE. The story arcs are well written and the acting is spot on...I wish each episode was 2 hours long...it's hard to wait for the next one.
B00D1N6OQ2,DebB,5,This is the best show on TV. I'm glad to see somebody actually produced a decent western without crude language and sex scenes. Longmire is a great story with characters that actually have some good morals. I hope this stays on for years to come.
B00D1N6OQ2,Deborah Martin,5,I got hooked on the show and have watched every episode since the beginning.  The actors are very good in their parts. Excellent casting. It is like a movie in sections and not a series of episodes. Superb
B00D1N6OQ2,Deborah R. Painchaud "De Pa",5,Great character development a d interesting backstory. Wish there was a third season!! I would most assuredly buy it now.
B00D1N6OQ2,Grandma Geek,5,My husband and I loved this series.  Excellent cast and multiple story lines.  No ads :).  Can't wait for season 3 to come out. I am a little old Grandma and I was able to set this show up to play on our TV - Amazon makes it so EZ.
B00D1N6OQ2,Helen E. Dowd "HD",4,Another series with a good cast and good writing. I love the scenery too. The season just started so I look forward to seeing more.
B00D1N6OQ2,hobbles,5,I love this show not quite a western but old type values with modern day police skills awesome actors  I hope they keep it going
B00D1N6OQ2,icewoman63,5,Longmire OMG I hope theres a number 3 please please please I will not could not get tired of this show.5 and more stars awsome
B00D1N6OQ2,Janet C. Walker,4,Pretty darn good for a 45 minute show each week.  I am a sucker for old westerns and this modern version is good to ride the river with.
B00D1N6OQ2,JJ,5,This is one of the Greatest Western Sheriff shows of all time!  Longmire's character is totally believe-able!  All his deputies characters are great and real life!  The reservation aspect is great and probably true to life!  Can not wait for this to start the Third Season!  We really like it!  Recommend for people over 16 years of age!
B00D1N6OQ2,Joanne,5,Fun story lines and interesting characters.  A modern day western set in Wyoming.  I love Walt Longmire and his idiosyncrasies.
B00D1N6OQ2,KayLee Osgood,5,I love this show because it is between a western and real life today all mixed into one show. I really enjoy this show.
B00D1N6OQ2,Kelley Kuhlman "paperglyphs",4,I love this series. I am from WY. and he fits the character. This year is written with questions left unanswered in each episode. Little by little more and more is revealed and I do like that. I just needed to get used to it. My biggest fear with something like that however is that the show wont be continued (many programs I have enjoyed have be cancelled) and then those questions wont be answered. Lets hope that does not happen.
B00D1N6OQ2,Kent C Christen,5,This series has developed some of the most compelling characters on TV today.  The back story is great and is moving along while the week to week stories are very enjoyable.
B00D1N6OQ2,Marguerite Martin,5,I immediately felt connected to the characters and feel truly immersed in each episode.  I can't wait for nest season.
B00D1N6OQ2,Marta Betts "Marta Betts",4,I found this TV show after I finished streaming another. It was refreshing to fine a current show on TV worth watching as I don't pay for mainstream cable or satellite. I like to pick the shows I want to pay for rather than paying a ton of money for horrible programming forces on me. I use Roku for streaming.
B00D1N6OQ2,michele symonette,5,family friendly without being cheesy. I quite enjoyed this down to earth show. the characters are well developed and have their own code of conduct which they follow
B00D1N6OQ2,Michelle King,5,My husband really likes the show and we cant wait for the next episodes.  I hope this show continues for years to come.
B00D1N6OQ2,MM,5,Having come from Wyoming this show fits the bill.Robert Taylor reminds me of my good old cowboy dad.Glad I can view every new episode weekly thru Amazon
B00D1N6OQ2,Mootsie,5,I loved season one so why not buy season two.  So far season two is just as entertaining if not more.  I'm always excited to see the next alert for the new episode in my email.  If you don't already know this...Robert Taylor was Agent Jones in The Matrix.
B00D1N6OQ2,Mother Mary,5,This is a great show.  Setting is a western town with a small Sheriff's Department with Longmire as the Sheriff.  Longmore has a knack for solving crimes.
B00D1N6OQ2,Nancy E. Gallagher,3,Good for an evening entertainment. Does not require deep reflection.  I made the mistake of watching season two before season one. Don't do this as you miss a bit of ongoing story line.
B00D1N6OQ2,Nancy L. Burris,4,I had as usual made a mistake and had already seen this. It is not the best but better than lots of things you can watch.
B00D1N6OQ2,Pamela,5,I have watched this series since the beginning.. we love it.. Don't want to miss a show.. You will love it..
B00D1N6OQ2,Patricia Appelquist,5,It is kinda bad writing trick to confuse the viewer while the actors act confused. The whole backstory is very compelling but honestly with so much bad stuff going on why in the world is the detective so focused on this one murder really?Funny minutes are quiet down for the higher level of drama from a crazy person to another crazy person ( I really think Wyoming should get a very big psych ward ) trying to kill the only 6 people in town but don't worry you won't need to know where that high school is ..its only in one episode.I might visit Wyoming because its on my way to the really crazy town of Baltimore
B00D1N6OQ2,Paula Jankowski,5,He is the perfect sheriff  ans I never missed the show clever in every wayI have shown it to a lot of people that did not know it existed
B00D1N6OQ2,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,We totally enjoy this show and were happy to see it got a second season.  Show centers around a Sheriff who is far from perfect.  He has to deal with the representatives of the nearby indian reservation.  He has a female deputy who is not much to look at but is a good actress.  Longmire is dealing with things in his past which have not fully been revealed.  Highly recommended show!
B00D1N6OQ2,R. McCuistian,5,Longmire has become one of our most favorite shows - the only problem is that we burn through the episodes too fast.  It's like having a freezer full of really good steaks and finishing them in a week because they're so good!
B00D1N6OQ2,Roberta,5,my husband is jealous.  i am totally in love with long mire and his deputy and everyone else on the show.  where do they film this.  i live in new mexico and would love to go and watch it and maybe meet everyone.  i am in love.
B00D1N6OQ2,Sherry,5,Longmire is a unique western flavored modern day cop/mystery show that really develops the characters. Sheriff Longmire is an enigmatic character that is modern with a touch of the old cowboy spirit and ethics. He has the soul of a native american and it comes to light in odd ways.Every show has a really good mystery and it has taken two seasons to really show Longmire's mysterious dark secret. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Longmire's best friend. His character is as interesting as Longmire's. The whole cast is great.The writers of Longmire really know how to develop a story and keep you engaged. I've thanked my friend many times for recommending this show. By the way... This is a very adult show and not for young children.
B00D1N6OQ2,S. McDonald,3,I found this series by accident.Similar story line as Jesse Stone.....I found series engaging and entertainingDefiantly surprises in the themes.
B00D1N6OQ2,StacyR,4,Love the western view of law enforcement.  Interesting characters and a refreshing change-of-pace from things set in New York (or other big cities).
B00D1N6OQ2,sybille ziegler,5,and I have to say I normally do not like any type of Western but Longmire is different - good story and always keeps you guessing what will happen next in regards to the death of his wife.
B00D1N6OQ2,sylvia korby,5,I think its a down to earth show that keeps your interest up. The actors are great! The story plot keeps you thinking.
B00D1N6OQ2,THE GHOSTSTAR     ORIGINAL,5,AS THE PLOT UNFOLDS IN SEASON 2 ABOUT THE SHERRIFS WIFE AND HER MURDER AND THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT IT HAS HAD ON EVERYONE INVOLVED ...WE SEE GREAT DEVELOPENT INTO THE PAST OF THE LIVES OF ALL THE PLAYERS ....THIS SEASON WAS 110% THE LAST EPISODE LEFT ME ON AN ALASKAN CLIFF IN A MINIVAN TEETERING..true story thats how i felt ...i get it....LONGMIRE IS SO COOL HES THE 007 OF THE COWBOY CULTURE....I GIVE IT AN 8 SECOND SALUTE AND ANY ONE IS INTO WESTERNS YOU WILL LOVE THIS MODERN DAY COBOY LAWMAN JUSTICE***
B00D1N6OQ2,Thelby,5,Love this show. My only problem with it is that they make so few episodes. This could easily be a 22 to 24 episode production.
B00D1N6OQ2,The repair guy,5,Look this may not be for everyone but it is my kind of show it is not vulgar and trite the characters are real and fresh. I love the enter action between the reservation and the town as it is the kind of thing that still happens today. It is a western and a modern story all in one with family values and real world issues. Well done all at A&E!
B00D1N6OQ2,troutpaws "troutpaws",5,like all the characters especially Longmire. good stories and exciting ending to the season. can't wait for season 3. good acting too. I watch alot of TV and should know!
B00D1N6OQ2,TW,5,I enjoyed this more than Law and order. Much better by far. It is best to start at the beginning of Season 1 so your not missing anything. But it is overall excellent. Looking forward to next season to see what happens next.
B00D1N6OQ2,V. Durost,4,Just had to have my favorite TV show at hand so I could watch it whenever I felt like it.
B00D1N8BYK,BlueCrabVintage,5,This show only gets better and better. Best thing on TV  I just wish they would show more full body shots of danielle.
B00D1N8BYK,Irving DeStiller,4,Let's give more credit to Danielle for keeping the business organized and The Boys on their toes .Patiently waiting to see the completed Roadster.
B00D1NBQ60,aidan pryde,1,Hammers every suspect as if they're guilty. Does he ever go back and apologize to all of the people he insulted who were innocent?Perfect example of cops and why we all hate them.
B00D1NBQ60,AlwaysWatching,5,EXCELLENT show....one of my very favorite TV shows! The style and character of the main actor makes for really entertaining show.
B00D1NBQ60,Amazon Customer,4,Really like the interaction of the stars and their relationships. Story lines are good. No over the top blood and guts and violence.  Love the location. Its a very good tv cop series!
B00D1NBQ60,Bailey,5,In my opinion the most solid of all the seasons.  Season four did a great job of developing the story arc and humanizing the characters while staying light hearted and fun.  This show has an addictive quality.  I especially enjoy the way Jim always makes an arrest in the middle of some public event at least once in every episode.  Great fun show.
B00D1NBQ60,Blue Moose,3,I am disappointed because this was the last episode and now it has been cancelled.
B00D1NBQ60,Bruce,4,I enjoyed this show. All 4 seasons and then wham! End of 4th season and show over forever. How could they leave fans hanging on that ending. Maybe that was the ending but who did it?
B00D1NBQ60,carl,5,We are great full to able to watch the next two seasons on dvd .  We enjoyed the first two seasons but couldn't find more.Then there it was.  We are watching no. 3 and will watch no. 4 after that.  Very good program with out a lot of offence language.Thank youThe Croosbys
B00D1NBQ60,charlie t. hodges,5,glades is a great show I hope  you continue to have more shows like this one on your prime lineup.
B00D1NBQ60,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",3,I have grown tired of the series.  I will not finish it.
B00D1NBQ60,Deborah Jones,5,I am very disappointed that they ended the show before they finished the story line. If I had known they were not going to finish it I would not have bought these episodes. But it was a good show.
B00D1NBQ60,Dennis F. Elwell,5,I choose this rating because it has good writers that keep you entertained. The grip of the story line ad development of the charactersis very high class. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00D1NBQ60,icewoman63,5,Wow great great show. makes you sit there and not want to blink so you wont miss anything.Great job !!!!!!I hope yall keep the story line going.thanks:>)O.M.G. I realy hope that episode#13 on season4 was not the end of the season what a bad ending not good omfg you cant do that to jim longworth what a bad way to end please tell me we have one or two more to go before the next season please.this is one of the best cop shows ive ever watched
B00D1NBQ60,J. B. Miller,4,Interesting case solving
B00D1NBQ60,jean h.,4,Series gets better each season.  Interesting plots and fun dialogue.  We are certainly looking forward to the new season five.
B00D1NBQ60,John O. McMurren,5,This show is smart and funny and moves right along. I then watched In Plain Sight and wondered if it was a bit of a copycat...
B00D1NBQ60,Karin Foglesong Moody,4,Lots of fun!  It is the characters' camaraderie that makes this show terrific.
B00D1NBQ60,KayLee Osgood,5,I love the way that det. Longworth kind of makes a joke out of murder investigations and solves them all while playing with his golf club.
B00D1NBQ60,L. Jones,5,The humor and beautiful sunny setting makes the sometimes gruesome subject matter less gruesome.Looking forward to finding out the outcome in the next season.
B00D1NBQ60,Marta Betts "Marta Betts",3,This show is entertaining. It's not too heavy to watch any time during the day. It's a good show to stream.
B00D1NBQ60,Michelle King,5,My husband loves this show.  It is querky and fun.  You cant help but love the characters in the show.
B00D1NBQ60,NormaJean James,3,This series has lost it's appeal.
B00D1NBQ60,patricia,4,Another one hit the road. I did enjoy watching all 4 seasons.  Good story line  To bad not on anymore
B00D1NBQ60,Ravencatt,5,I love this series.  Interesting characters.  Good drama with a refreshing touch of humor.  I don't know why they cancelled the series.  Everyone I talk to is hoping they'll reconsider and give us another season.  And to top the downer of no additional episodes they left it with a cliffhanger that now we won't know how it comes out.  This is why I figure TV executive IQs run no higher than single digits.
B00D1NBQ60,Rebecca McCord,5,My husband and I loved this series and are so disappointed that's it's over! Why do all the good ones get cut?
B00D1NBQ60,rebma,4,Lots of fun. Detective Jim Longworth is such a smart aleck. The Kia references are a little over the top though. But the show is fun.
B00D1NBQ60,shelly,5,I love the show and am really upset that they are thinking or have already cancelled this show with an ending that leaves everything in the air !
B00D1NBQ60,William Brennan "wreckingball34",4,I was psyched to see that this show was free on Prime and watched all the seasons straight through to the amazing cliffhanger ending of season 4 only to find out afterward that the show was canceled!! AAAAARGH!!! I was really getting into the story and I'm bummed to say the least. Why did A&E cancel it? It was a good show.
B00D2D7X52,Agramma,5,i love dinosaurs every time.  good characters.  fractures in time and time travel are more of my favorite things.  y
B00D2D7X52,car992,5,I love the new show and getting to know the new people. Niall Matter was a great actor in Eurika. My only question is why Conner didn't help more. There was a lot they had learned that would really help these new characters. Guess its a sink or swim thing. LOL.
B00D2D7X52,C E Matthews,4,I like this show a lot. I hope it goes into a second season - but not sure if it will - I understand it is produced by a Canadian company and they may not order a second season... bummer.
B00D2D7X52,CW FISHER "stars for connie",3,The first 5 seasons of Primeval was good but this New World lacks something.  I could not contact with the new characters and it just did not stand up to the previous seasons of excitement and mystery. please what the previous seasons they are really good.
B00D2D7X52,Diane S,3,I like this show but I understand why it only lasted one season.  After watching all of the seasons of the UK version I find this version fell a little flat.  I like Niall Matter but his love interest was the wrong choice.
B00D2D7X52,Ray Macmeeken "Ray MacMeeken",5,Moved from London to Canada but still the show Prieval.  Just as good and so glad it is continuing.  Likable cast and same stories of animals coming out of time anomalies.  If you were a fan before then you can still be a fan.  If you think it is anything like the movie it is not.  For Sci-fi fans it's worth your time. Enjoy
B00D2D7X52,R.L. Black,2,Love the show; Hate some of the content.  I'd give the show at least four stars if it wasn't for G** D*** said in several of the later episodes and Toby having a lesbian kiss in episode 7 &#34;Babes in the Woods&#34;.  The language and sexuality were unnecessary to the story and were gratuitous to the plotline.
B00D2D7X52,vet,5,This is a Canadian spin-off of BBC's series by the same name (Which we also enjoy quite a lot...)We like the characters and the story line  and find the show entertaining.There is enough drama to keep it interesting and enough humor to make it light without becoming another annoying sitcom...Hope they continue producing it...
B00D2D7X52,wtchy1,5,I always enjoyed the BBC version of Primeval so I was thrilled to know it was being reinvented for North America.. Nice to see the show throw back to the British Characters occasionally too.
B00D2GR3TK,Michael B.,5,I liked the first two seasons that &#34;Disney&#34; came out with for the &#34;Avengers&#34;. This series has been surprising in keeping the &#34;comic book&#34; feel to the stories so far.
B00D2GR3TK,Michael W. Fisher "Michael",5,I followed Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes from beginning to end and I was sorry to see it end after only two seasons. I think Avengers Assemble is the perfect successor for the series.
B00D2GR3TK,Mike,5,This cartoon is really good but could use more story but the action is really good and the characters are true to form.
B00D3FT5VO,microsoft is not monop,1,what the hell is wrong with film mkaersan adventure film should not be mindlessand just insaneas this plot isand get some big strong guys not tiny midget with no muscles for fighting jeeeeesh
B00D3FT5VO,thecoolcard,4,I know that might be high for this movie but I did like it I would watch it again. if you like the t.v show Vikings you will like it. a lot of the same people are in this....I don't know why the rating is so low on this I have watched 1000 movies that was not as good as this one. so give it a chance no big name stars in it but it was very good
B00D3MQ2DQ,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,Melissa & Joey finally get together this season and much hilarity ensues. I love watching these two actors in new roles. I grew up watching them on Blossom and Clarissa Explains It All.
B00D3MQ2DQ,Carolyn,5,This show is very funny. The cast is really great. The kids are really good. They really pull off acting like sister and brother. I think Melissa and Joey have great chemistry. I've seen them in other shows together and they work wonderful  together.
B00D3MQ2DQ,Diligent Diva,5,I adore this show am so glad I can purchase it here. I don't have to wait for the rest of it to come on Netflix.  Melissa and Jo are as hilarious as ever and now cuter than ever as a couple.
B00D3MQ2DQ,Just Another Page,5,I've been a fan of Melissa Joan Hart since Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Melissa and Joey is a funny show and always keeps me interested.
B00D3MQ2DQ,Lorena M,5,this is a very good show and the actors act well together and the story line is good too and funny
B00D3MQ2DQ,Suzi,5,I love this show.  It has good humor and it really is ok for most ages to watch!  Good job!
B00D3MQ2DQ,Tamara L Perez,4,This show reminds me of &#34;Who's the boss?&#34; from years ago.  That was a good show and so is this.I'm surprized that Joey and Melissa are already hooked up.  I thought that would have waited til right before the show went off the air.
B00D3UVWQK,David Linder,5,My wife and I found this gem scrolling through amazon prime on our roku box...hope they bring a season 2
B00D3UVWQK,SouthMO,4,I was not aware of the copperheads before this movie.  It was educational as well as entertaining.  This was a refreshing change from the majority of movies of our time: looking at the lives of civilians during the War Between the States and the way it portrayed it all.  The speech at the funeral near the end was well done.
B00D5OZQUC,Adele M. Klima,5,I cannot wait for season 4. I love this show!Why do I need ten more words? I have said it ALL!
B00D5OZQUC,Agramma,5,enjoy time travelers always.  i like the characters in the story .  science fiction has been a fav of mine since &#34; the blob&#34;
B00D5OZQUC,Alice,4,One of the best scifi series on tv.  Very good graphics and a very interesting unfolding storyline.  I would highly recommend it to any scifi enthusiast.  Not far fetched.
B00D5OZQUC,Amanda C.,3,Its another one of those series that you get attached to the character but not so much to the plot that you rush to watch the next episode.
B00D5OZQUC,Amazon Customer,5,I really enjoyed this si fi season and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys si fi as well.  can not wait for season 4 to come out. thanks
B00D5OZQUC,Annie M daffodils,4,I enjoyed all three seasons of this show very much.  It is about an Earth that has largely been taken over by aliens but there is a human resistance in places.  Good writing and good acting.
B00D5OZQUC,Artemus Returns,5,More of the same good stuff eery season. Good training for us when the economy collapses to dust by the work of 435 aliens among us (Congress).
B00D5OZQUC,bdeath,5,enjoyed watching the show. had a good story line and characters. Would watch it again and when more episodes come out.
B00D5OZQUC,Benjamin L Teates,4,The acting is believable for the setting the characters find themselves in. The writing is well done. I really enjoy the episodes!
B00D5OZQUC,B. Hamlin,5,I think this is a Spielberg production and Spielberg does not make bad movies or TV shows. It's very well done and well acted. The plot is fast-moving and Keeps one's attention.
B00D5OZQUC,Bill D. "Billy D.",4,The story is unique with lots of twists and turns to keep you interested.  Some violence and adult situations that arent appropriate for kids but probably fine for teens.
B00D5OZQUC,Bill,5,Both my wife and I enjoy this show immensely! It's tough to find shows that everyone in the family will watch.
B00D5OZQUC,Bonnie Chinnick,5,Sorry to see it end.  Kept me captivated and engaged all the way through.  Have told all my friends to put on their list.
B00D5OZQUC,B. Slack,1,Don't ever get a season pass from Amazon unless you want to get ripped off. I chose the season pass option to get the episodes as soon as they came out then at the end of the season they charge me for behind the scenes 2 minute clips! Customers should only be charge for real episodes. Never again will I get a season pass!
B00D5OZQUC,Butch Holmberg,3,Like the show but the plot appears to repeat itself at times. Beginning to become evident and not surprising which is sad.
B00D5OZQUC,Cappnormal,5,I wish this show would have had enough support to keep going. I very much enjoyed watching all the episodes. Thanks Amazon Prime!
B00D5OZQUC,ccc,5,enjoyed the storyline
B00D5OZQUC,Chuck St. Louis "The Saint",5,Another series that could be watched from beginning to end. Noah Wiley makes the show. Good suspense. A must.Chuck
B00D5OZQUC,CT Crawford,4,Second season was much better than the first.  Looking forward to seeing if the good aliens will teach us things to help humanity.  Great acting in the second season!  Hope the third continues to build.
B00D5OZQUC,Dan Hangen,4,This is a really good series.  Can't wait for season 4.  Good plot twists and storyline. Maybe another alien race will join in for the fun.
B00D5OZQUC,David Murphy "Nalvage",5,This is a very plausible senario. Some say there here some won't. Where does that leave us. Yes yes yes
B00D5OZQUC,David Swayne,4,Very entertaining show. The special effects are getting better and the character cycling is decent. Overall a very entertaining show. I can't wait for the next season to start!
B00D5OZQUC,Deborah Minyard,5,Dont know why this one ended so quickly. I was really enjoying it. Wonder if it will ever return with an ending?
B00D5OZQUC,Debra Frisco,5,Hooked. Star Wars continues.... this time on Earth. Great Spielberg.
B00D5OZQUC,Devin Gilson,2,Little plot development & slow moving I fell asleep trying to watch this one. Not really worth the time or energy.
B00D5OZQUC,Differently Driven "Anime Lover",5,And the truth will not set you free but will make it clear that there is never rest when freedom is so close at hand. A friend who challenges your beliefs in them and then breaks it gives this series the full circle of emotional upheaval that is needed to make a great show.
B00D5OZQUC,D. Molder "D. Molder",5,This has been an awesome series so far. I am hoping it endures and more of the story line can be told before it looses popularity.
B00D5OZQUC,D. Moore "Dano",4,Love it.And hope it keeps going.....To much on TV worth watching...But Falling Skies is worth watching!Love it!
B00D5OZQUC,Dog Friendly,4,I've enjoyed Falling Skies from the first season.  It's one of my &#34;must watch&#34; shows.  The third season is still strong.
B00D5OZQUC,Dolores Taylor,5,I have enjoyed all of the three seasons. The sound and video are very good. I am looking forward to season four.
B00D5OZQUC,Douglas Deicke,5,Falling Skies was fantastic because Noah Wyle led a stellar cast this season and Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers on the show.
B00D5OZQUC,drscot,5,Now we are sitting here drumming our fingers and tapping our feet while waiting for season 4 next summer! :(
B00D5OZQUC,duncanhaus,5,my favorite show.  I am way to addicted to it. cant wait till Monday morning to get the next episode on my kindle fire.
B00D5OZQUC,earthgirl53 "earthgirl53",4,I am a sci fi fan and have enjoyed the entire series. It's well acted and the special effects are excellent. Looking forward to season 4!
B00D5OZQUC,Ellen M. Sorensen "mtnmaggie",4,A good science fiction with a different type of alien and a cast that works together well.
B00D5OZQUC,Floyd Hill "Hill",4,This was a big change from the last season and with the addition of the new aliens...I do believe this is only going to get better! :-))
B00D5OZQUC,gizzy,5,Wonderful series. It is so well done. The characters are so well drawn. Can't wait until I see the next season.
B00D5OZQUC,Glenn physics,5,Well wort the time to watch!
B00D5OZQUC,Grover D Carson,5,I truly liked the action and couldn't wait for the next series. Can not wait for the next season to start next summer.
B00D5OZQUC,Harry Newman,5,Probably one of the best action shows on TV. Love being able to watch these shows at my pace instead of once a week.
B00D5OZQUC,Ingie,4,This is a very interesting and exciting show to me. I can not wait for the 4th season now that I am all caught up.
B00D5OZQUC,Iris Webb Wright "Iris Wright",2,Too much on the long deep philosophic speeches during crisis that just require grabbing your butt and heading out. We got the deep connections after the first 10 minutes.  Coulda been good. Too forced.
B00D5OZQUC,Jack,5,The first season was difficult to get into because of the story line was a little silly...season two got better....season three is even better...
B00D5OZQUC,Jacob "RavenLoc",4,Falling Skies Season three takes place several months after the events of season two final episode.  Those that survivied the coup lead by the military and deposing its former President.  Tom Matheson has taken on the role of its newly elected Preisdent and is still leading its forces into combat against the Eshin in the hopes of driving them off world.  Along the way the have a new ally whose very purpose is to destroy the Eshin and all they have done in thier wake.  Tom dubbed him &#34;Coachese&#34; after a Native Americanwarrior who helped the early colonists from history.  Coachese brings with him protection and devices that have allowed the men and women to surivvie and thrive to a certain point.  Now with the ablity to remove harnessed children and to take out any of the &#34;Mechs&#34; that even try to break the permiter they now have.  For a few moments they can breathe.Tom is dealing not only with larger issues but with his own family.  His oldest son is paralyzed from the waist down and reduced to rolling around in a wheelchair.  His middle son seems to becomeing more and more withdrawn from those around him and taking to be with the &#34;skitters&#34; that have joined them in open rebellion against the Eshin. His youngest has been hanging around Pope and his beserkers too much and beigns to act out.  While the Doctor is heavily preagneat with her and Tom's child.  All this pale's in comparison to discovering that memebrs of the govemrent may have surivived and could very well be fighting thinking they are the last of humanity.  Pope spreading his ideas of what the aliens good or bad are really doing on Earth and what it means for humanity.  Also discoerving a spy within thier own ranks sabotaing everything and killing those that could prove to be a problem for the Eshin.  All this plus much more.  S ocheck out Falling Skies Season Three for yourself.
B00D5OZQUC,Jacry1990,5,I get all the series each season. Love this show! Re-watch thru the year and again before new season comes out.
B00D5OZQUC,Jaimison,5,the season was excellent. the quality on the stream was excellent. no problems at all and well worth the watch if you like the show. they keep stepping up their game.awesome Prime stream.
B00D5OZQUC,James Gaan "PaiGowMaster",5,Great show. I wish the world would get it together.  Although there will always be traitors in are ranks. lol
B00D5OZQUC,James,5,Good show to watch with the family. Shows how a group of people come together to stop an Alien force.
B00D5OZQUC,Janet C. Walker,4,I used the season pass for this show and enjoyed the main story lines.  I do not enjoy being stuck by Amazon for the 2 minute ad shows with an actor and charged for a full episode.  I am really ticked at being robbed like this. I do recommend buying the shows individually.
B00D5OZQUC,Jennifer D. Williams,5,This show has become one of my all-time favorite! It keeps you engages and never slows down! I look forward to each and every show just like &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;.  They are the best!!
B00D5OZQUC,J. N. McCarthy,4,Good to watch but gets slow in parts.  I look forward to next season to see where these characters go!
B00D5OZQUC,Jodel,4,I couldn't believe it was over already & I can't wait for the next season to see what will happen.
B00D5OZQUC,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",5,I am not a &#34;Prepper&#34; or a survivalist. With that said I could see humanity falling to the level of infighting you witness in this show. I don't think we face extinction from Aliens but more likely from each other.
B00D5OZQUC,Joyce A Campbell,5,The characters are great and even the bad ones are interesting.  Always  new events and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is very good.
B00D5OZQUC,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",5,Have always like SciFi and the everlasting question of whether we "are not alone" in this universe.  Seeing the Masons stay a family unit through the turmoil is a nice change after reading daily headlines of family breakups.  All the characters keep me guessing.. Love um/ hate um even changes week to week.  Can't believe the season is almost over.... seems like it just started.  The 7/20 show had me glued to the computer screen.
B00D5OZQUC,lucy1895,4,I am a fan of futuristic sci fi shows so I am inclined to like most shows of this type.  The twists and turns during this season kept me interested and surprised.  I didn't finish the season with any favorite characters but would return to watch the next season.
B00D5OZQUC,Lyle,3,SEASON THREE SHOULD BE FREE WITH PRIME AFTER PAYING $ 90.00 A YEAR.I GET MORE FREE SHOWS &  PREVIEWS ON HULU FOR FREETHIS AMAZOM PRIME MEMBERSHIP IS FOR THE BIRDS.NO RENEWAL UNLESS AMAZON PRIME STARTS TO HAVE BENIFITS
B00D5OZQUC,magicboo2u,5,Keeps you hooked! Love shows that are sci-fi but realistic-like it could really happen. Kinda like The Dome-if you like it you will like this too!
B00D5OZQUC,MargyL "MargyL",4,I like the way the storyline develops in this series.  It isn't cut and dry who the bad aliens are.  Special effects are good and characters are all wells cast.
B00D5OZQUC,Martin Allain,5,I have very much enjoyed the interaction between the aliens and humans. It has truly kept me intrigued see how you like this series.
B00D5OZQUC,Mary E. Shipman "LizMoves",5,I love this show!  Suspenseful and well acted. Can't wait for next season!
B00D5OZQUC,maurice cortez,5,This is a great alien apocalypse story about a family from boston. There are good an bad aliens just as there are good and bad people.
B00D5OZQUC,Max Remley,4,Pretty good and worth watching - especially after investing the time to watch seasons 1 and 2.  I'm just not as invested in this season.  We'll see how it wraps up but this could be my last season with this one.
B00D5OZQUC,Melissa,5,at first i really didnt like this show but now i cant wait to see what happens super excited :)
B00D5OZQUC,MiMiself&amp;i,4,Fun show with all the twists and turns you would expect. Watch if you love sci-fi and other guilty pleasures.
B00D5OZQUC,nythawk,4,Now that the good aliens and the resistance have parted company I keep wondering what the good aliens have in store for earth. I have a feeling that the bad aliens are going to mount a counter offensive. I also think that season four will probably be the last season.
B00D5OZQUC,Pacific Mitchell,5,If you like SCI-FI then you'll love this; I buy the episode on Amazon Instant Video as soon as it comes out
B00D5OZQUC,Pamela,5,we watched all the seasons through Amazon and now we are caught up for the new season. I just hope they do not end it.. Great series..
B00D5OZQUC,Patricia Doherty,5,The  last series shows conflict between those ready to fight to end the war and those  wanting to dig in and build a working society.
B00D5OZQUC,Paul Danneman,5,The series is quite captivating and there is always some surprise in every episode.  What a wonderful waste of time.
B00D5OZQUC,Ray Macmeeken "Ray MacMeeken",4,An excellent show with a very good cast.  The world has been invaded with bad aliens and most humans have died.  Many good twist and turns are keeping you guessing and now the good aliens may or may not be the answer to their prayers.  We'll have to wait for season 4.
B00D5OZQUC,R. Hartley "Writer's Mind",5,There are several new question at the beginning of this new season. I'm really excited about it and ready for more.
B00D5OZQUC,Richard Goodlette,4,I got sooo involved in the struggle of the humans and Volm against the Eshfeni!!! then to know another mole was about threw me.But there were some plot jumps I could not wrap my head around. The cliff hanger ending made up for some of the lagoons in the time line.
B00D5OZQUC,Robert D. Richter,5,This was an original story that kept my interest until the end. Good acting and a lot of edge of your seat action for a TV series.
B00D5OZQUC,ROBERT R LARSON JR,4,Episodes are beginning to drag.  The story line is drying up.  I'm afraid the show will start losing focus if it goes for more than one or two more seasons
B00D5OZQUC,Ronald L. Montes "Ron The Tech",5,The best Sci Fi seies out there.  You never know what is going to happen.  I don't know but I saw the Under The Dome yesterday and that looks pretty good also.
B00D5OZQUC,Ron Sowell,5,Not so unbelievable as to be science fiction. Moves at just the right pace.....action but also real-to-life drama and believable characters.
B00D5OZQUC,ryan halbrook,4,Love season 3.  I feel like it hit its stride from the beginning and has just kept on.  Love love love it
B00D5OZQUC,S. Grady,5,We are hooked on the show and look forward to the next season! Great acting and as well written as Babylon 5
B00D5OZQUC,Shaun R. Moll,5,Another great series from TNT! I love the show and am currently watching the 4th season.
B00D5OZQUC,Sonshine,5,This is the best TV show I've ever seen.  It is intelligent and exciting.  It always keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.
B00D5OZQUC,St Johns,5,Can hardly wait for this shows to begin again.  Though first two seasonswere a little more exciting to me.
B00D5OZQUC,SuperDad "SuperDad",5,I like the new alliances. I hope they come out with an explanation of the missing 7 months. Love it.
B00D5OZQUC,The1and0nly,1,This is cool as a side story but boba fett isn't nearly as awsome in this as he is in the movie. The battle with the radio active penguin from mars was pretty sweet though.
B00D5OZQUC,The repair guy,5,Top shelf Sci Fi it is about time we had a new hit like this to watch and talk about as it has been awhile for a great science fiction story like this to be told. Keep it up great stuff can't wait till the next episode to come each week on the edge of your seat excitement all the time with a masterful story unfolding constantly. Yeah TNT!
B00D5OZQUC,Toti,5,Great storyline that is full of surprises. Writing at its best. Great acting. This show portrays the human spirit and what it can accomplish when people come together.
B00D5OZQUC,Ucrazy!,5,I give this show five stars because it continues to entertain!  So much material out right now simply forgets the objective.  I wasn't sure they would be able to pull it off with the rather &#34;out there&#34; story line.  They are pulling heavily from the character development investments made in the first two seasons.  Good thing!!  It keeps the show entertaining.
B00D5OZQUC,Value Shopper Pensacola,4,I don't normally watch science fiction but this one kept my interest.  The cast was great.  I hope they will make another season.
B00D5OZQUC,victoria,5,Not only do we love it we can't wait for the next season to be released. When it is we will want to view it for sure. the last season left it so open and we're just wondering how it turns out.
B00D5OZQUC,Victoria R. Brown,5,Watched the entire thing and was very happy with the program.  I will also be ordering additional seasons until I catch up.
B00D5OZQUC,wayneit,4,Starting off good. Just should have a few more encounters with the aliens. The new chief of the alien group shouldn't look so tempting. Probably shouldn't be blonde. Laughing.
B00D5P0QMY,Amazon Customer,5,Holder and Linden have become two favorite characters of mine. Not only do they have more dimension but the ensemble cast are tuned to clarity in season 3.
B00D5P0QMY,Amazon Customer "Nina",5,I would protest the heck out of this series it sure makes it look like the World of the Dead but these stories are great and Linden and Holder are magic.  Mireille Enos was on talk show dressed up and made up and she is beautiful so I appreciate how she is willing to look for the story.  Love it hope there is a new story next year and like the addition of the Death Row twist too.
B00D5P0QMY,Carlos A. Hermida "Carlos",5,Great series. Very entertaining.
B00D5P0QMY,CrankySpice,5,I love this series and Season 3 stands up to the first 2 seasons - not an easy task! The acting is superb and the plot is interesting and keeps your attention. I look forward to it every week.
B00D5P0QMY,Dangerman "Dan G.",2,They blew it. This is not The Killing of seasons 1-2. It has the moody atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest and that's about it. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) is the only saving grace. The Linden character needs major therapy. Gregg Henry's character has some funny dialogue. But there's not enough of him. Halfway through the season I couldn't care less who did it. And what's with all the smoking? Everybody smokes feverishly. Is the show now set in the sixties?  Maybe the producers thought they were shooting Mad Men. I'm going to check out the follow-up season of the original Danish series to see if they had better luck extending the franchise.
B00D5P0QMY,D C Lathrop "DC in AZ",5,Watched every episode so far and season 3 is off to a riveting start!  Great tie in to last years finally.
B00D5P0QMY,Deborah Robinson,5,I love this show.  Great acting and great character development.  Can't wait for season 4 if there is one. Love it.  (This twenty word thing is killing me...pun intended.)
B00D5P0QMY,GA girl,5,Dark. A great murder mystery.  I like it.
B00D5P0QMY,Gary Guddy,5,They've loosen up the writing and characters somewhat.I am please to see Sarah smile at holden.  good work go.
B00D5P0QMY,Gunner,5,FANTASTIC writing! Terrific actors!!! So Many twists & turns! Keeps you guessing! We Highly recommend this series- Its the Best we've seen in years!
B00D5P0QMY,Helen E. Dowd "HD",4,Haven't seen all the episodes yet. I heard from others though this might be the best one. Hope to find out if that is true another time.
B00D5P0QMY,James Hall,5,This show has had an amazing cast and the writers have nailed this one! I wish there could be more shows as good as this one. It's sad these types of shows only come around every four to five years.
B00D5P0QMY,Jessica R Schley,5,Holder and Landon are one of the best detective duos ever on television.  The writing for this show is brilliant; the plot - never predictable.
B00D5P0QMY,Kelsey A. Kruse,5,Will be so sorry when I finish this season. Seattle looks grittier than my own B'more did in The Wire. Love Linden. Love Holder.
B00D5P0QMY,Lezli A. Polm,5,I love this show! The writing is excellent and acting lives up to the engrossing plot-lines. I hope there will be a season 4 ...
B00D5P0QMY,M. Hays,5,Each season of this show gets better and better.  It's such a dark drama and season three moved very fast.  My only disappointment was how few episodes were in this season.  I can't wait for season 4.
B00D5P0QMY,Michael Sullivan,5,Good story line and great actors. I have been surprised at how much I enjoyed this show. Watched all three seasons. Takes a different approach then most cop series. Follow one crime or search for one criminal the entire season. Was skeptical at first but the shows keep you in suspense.
B00D5P0QMY,mocha teddy,5,The soundtrack is awesome. The acting is first rate. The story is convoluted. The show is so intense at times its hard to watch.
B00D5P0QMY,MWOO,5,Characters and story line are great.  I can't wait for the episode to start.I am sure I will watch the whole season again.  I like it as much as thefirst two seasons.
B00D5P0QMY,Patricia Doherty,5,Atmosphere fits drama.  Wonderful ACTING. High level of suspense.  Surprising ending.  Highly recommend series to any mystery lover. The end.
B00D5P0QMY,Richard L. Depatta,5,great
B00D5P0QMY,Roxanne,5,I got hooked on The Killing during the first 2 seasons. Linden and Holder are such great characters that I didn't mind that it took 2 seasons to find out who killed Rosie Larsen. Each episode teased you with suggesting a potential killer only to have the next episode show how that character was not the killer. Season 3's addition of Peter Sarsgaard as Death Row inmate Ray Seward is an excellent addition to the show and I hope Sarah can help him.
B00D5P0QMY,Steven Herring,5,I am currently watching season 2 and would love it if Amazon made season 3 a Manufacture on Demand title. I love my physical media and don't like buying digital titles. Please Amazon make it happen.
B00D5P0QMY,sybille ziegler,5,I absolutely loves Season 1 and 2 - story is great and the actors are amazing - thank you for great entertainment!
B00D5P1F8S,Cami=) "Cami=)",4,You can never run out of drama in Jersey......one of the reasons why this one still is watchable is that they are actually genuinely crazy not stupid! Producers or not! So the stuff they invent I'm sure isn't too far off the crazy tracks that train normally runs on!
B00D5P1F8S,Jac1528,5,The Housewives shows are my guilty pleasure. I love watching to see what's gonna happen next! It is so addicting!
B00D5P1F8S,Jdances "bdancer",5,I honestly think this is the best Housewives franchise!  These folks let it all hang out in front of the camera.  They put the &#34;real&#34; in reality.  Bless them.
B00D5P1F8S,Lynn,5,A very entertaining show. Reminds me somewhat of my disfunctional family!I watch it and it reminds me of why we shouldn't behave the way they do. I really do not like the family facing jail time. Maybe that will help them face reality
B00D5P1F8S,Nicole Crew "Trauma Queen",5,Sick of seeing Teresa never own up to a damn thing. She got better this season. Probably one of the best seasons since everyone seemed to be on better terms...finally. My favorite housewives out of all of them are jersey and New York.
B00D5P42W4,Bookworm4,4,Cute show. The main reason I am hooked as I used to live in L.A. and being miserable now living in the deep south I enjoy the scenery of this show way more than the story. It's help me a great deal with my home sickness. As silly as that may seem. Moving here has been an unbearable culture shock for me.
B00D5P42W4,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",1,I really liked Keeping up with the Kardashians about 6 seasons ago.  The plot is never changing and it's always such super high drama for a bunch of rich people.  This season is disappointing and not worth the money.
B00D5PCXI4,glacierbear,5,In this series of videos we meet several people who support their household in manners not quite like what you would see in the cities and towns. The people involved don't get up and go in and punch a time clock nor have to put up with the corporate BS. They rely on themselves and the land around them to make their living. A very well put together documentary series. if you think you might want to start homesteading type living there are some great ideas in these videos.
B00D5PCXI4,Irving DeStiller,4,This season seems a bit lackluster to me .The &#34; plots &#34; jump from pillar to post in my opinion .
B00D5PCXI4,John P. Bradford "Angelophile",5,The second in the series follows several who dare live an alternate lifestyle in the wilds around the country from Alaska to North Carolina.  This show makes one lust for the out of doors experience and a simpler life.
B00D5PCXI4,Patrick Highers,5,I like reality TV that shows unique lifestyles and good hard living.
B00D63BMYG,charismatic,5,I'm so glad it going to be a second season. Don't be misled by the title. It's a good show about women with real problems.
B00D63BMYG,DonnaSays "Amazon makes my Life easy!",5,Just bought season one and have been watching it nonstop. The acting is great holds your interest. The actors are all beautiful. One of my favorite shows now.
B00D69JGRK,BL,5,My children and grand children enjoy this show.  It is clever has ingenuity and above all makes us laugh.  We wish there were more of them!
B00D69JGRK,Brian "batfan",4,My kids and I enjoy watching this show together. Pretty funny show. Lots of slap stick comedy. Just don't get hung up who is doing the voices compared to the movies.
B00D69JGRK,K.V.,5,This was a great spin off from very cool characters of Madagascar series.  I could have my kid watch it and not have to monitor the subject manner.
B00D69JGRK,mbyers,5,Great family entertainment! These penguins are cool and full of action. Lots of laughs and fun for the whole family!
B00D69JGRK,Winfred crowe,5,this one that my greatgrand son really likes. the antics are great and it is clean fun. keep up the good work
B00D6BQ068,Janice E. Garver,3,Not bad for a low budget film. I found myself getting mad at the weakling for being such a wimp. Guess that is why I would give it 3 stars. This movie could have had more action and close calls. Don't expect "The Walking Dead" type action.
B00D6BR75Q,B. Kelley,5,It's relatively educational and its one of my kid's favorite shows.  He's watch all of them once and he's going back through them from the beginning.
B00D6BR75Q,Charlotte Puderbaugh,5,The colors are bright and cheerful. Great story lines.kkeps a child's attention while teaching them life lessons.My grandaughterreally enjoys this show.
B00D6BR75Q,D. Ernstzen "DE",5,I don't think any child should grow up without experiencing Dora. It helps with the singing adventures and puzzles which is just great for every child. Don't hesitate in getting this.
B00D6BR75Q,dmlopez,4,Our granddaughter really enjoys Dora and she really is learning from it.  She uses the Spanish words that she learns from Dora and it has helped her with her counting.
B00D6BR75Q,E B Fricks,5,My 2 year old loves Dora! He knows all of the characters names and and the story lines. My little guys has learned some of his colors names in English and in Spanish watching Dora.Also It's not a bad show to have to sit through as an adult.
B00D6BR75Q,Jenny K Carney,4,My 2 year old loves Dora. The only issue I have is seasons 4 and 5 are not part of the prime package.
B00D6BR75Q,Joi Mcclary,4,I'd say this one comes in at number 4 in my daughter's top 5 shows. She can usually sit through an entire episode. She absolutely loves Boots.
B00D6BR75Q,Linda Wilson,5,All my granddaughter wants to do is watch Dora with grandma on her kindle should grandma snuggles with her. She follows along and loves saying MAP & BACKPACK when asked
B00D6BR75Q,Lynda Norton "Highland Enthusiast",4,This is a learning program and my grandson LOVES it so we watch it.  Spanish is the language that it teaches and it is ok NOW that Spanish is a requirement in schools a little exposure isn't a bad thing.
B00D6BR75Q,MT,5,My son loves Dora (and Diego). He loves the characters and their adventures. They also engage children in the adventures.
B00D6BR9EU,eric matheny,5,We watch them over and over . Fun energetic problem solving for my kids . Excellent for babies and toddlers
B00D6BR9EU,Gayle Lai "Nanna",5,Blue's Clues keeps the toddler's attention while appropriate teaching lessons for their age group. My grandson watches them over and over.
B00D6BR9EU,g.hilary,5,My 4 year old grand-daughters favor show...keep them comingI will soon order these dvds thank you so much !
B00D6BR9EU,HannahLynn,5,Love the show. My daughter can sit & watch a couple episodes & will narrate as they go. It's too cute!
B00D6BR9EU,Kindle Customer "aspiring author",5,This season of blues clues is good. My three year old grandson downloaded this and regularly watches theVideos. I 've watched with him and the season is engaging and fun.
B00D6BR9EU,Kindle Customer,4,I first watched Blue's Clues as a babysitter about 20 years ago and now enjoy watching it with my own children.  My kids (ages 4 and 1) both enjoy it.
B00D6BR9EU,Sheree "Shar",5,My children enjoyed these videos very much.  The videos are very entertaining and educational.  The lenght of the videos is perfect.
B00D6MQ6ZM,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,The characters took so many unexpected and surprising turns but I really fell in love with all of them them during the first season of the show. A really wonderful family show.
B00D6MQ6ZM,Tribute,5,The kids are genuine and the parents are likeable.  The show doesn't go for the glitzy glam of typical teen shows and instead focuses on engaging characters.  There are life lessons but also plenty of joy and warmth.
B00D6PJWO6,Elizabeth Bailey,5,It's intriguing and inspiring.  Not according to what might be expected.  It's uplifting and moves the soul.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a closer look into their self.
B00D6PJWO6,E. Magno,2,I thought I would like this show because it had a good cast but I found it very difficult to get into with a sluggish plot. I guess it plays well for a limited audience
B00D6PJWO6,KMC,2,After 20 minutes we turned it off. We just don't care for foul language that never seems to stop.Not worth our time to finish watching.
B00D6PJWO6,Martha S. Clark,1,It was constantly buffering and took forever to load.  So disappointing.  You have a lot of good HBO shows available now but there are so many issues with the buffering.
B00D6PJWO6,Muffy Dreyfuss "Muffy",5,Great series and so relevant today. Watch it. You definitely won't be sorry.
B00D76BEIQ,Amazon Customer,5,I can't stop watching this show. Just when you think you know what's going on there's some insane twist that has literally made me jump out of my chair and yell &#34;WHAT?!&#34;. I love it.
B00D76BEIQ,dana wall,5,Thank you for this fun show. I love it! I miss it when it goes off the air. The girls are so great together and who is A -- will we ever know.
B00D76BEIQ,D. Davenport,5,My wife and daughter caught up on this show this summer and are loving the 4th season. Glad I bought it.
B00D76BEIQ,Heather Hintz,5,I loved all 4 seasons. I was hoping for more out of the ending. I read that Allison has a twin and the final season did not touch on it. And we still don't know who killed the  person that was supposedly Allison.
B00D76BEIQ,Hotmess,5,I WILL FINISH THE WHOLE THING IN A DAY AND THEN CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT.... LOVE IT!!!!
B00D76BEIQ,Kate "OhNo",5,Keeps you on your toes..think you have it solved and then..another plot..My daughter got me addicted to this on Netflix...
B00D76BEIQ,Kathy Miller,5,I work nights so I bought the fourth season to catch up the latest news on the show which is neat!
B00D76BEIQ,Looking for a Blockbuster,5,Oh wow was not expecting the ending in this movie. Well done Tyler Perry.  Entertains and teaches lessons at the same time. The moral of the story is watch this movie.
B00D76BEIQ,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",4,All around good show in the beginning but it just is starting to bore me. I loved the first 3 seasons. I still watch but not as much gusto.
B00D76BEIQ,Mgriffin2312,5,Full of twists and turns! I love that there is a new surprise each episode! Really enjoying this season a lot!
B00D76BEIQ,miss tinkerbell,5,this show is amazing so addicting i'm on the edge of my seat during each and every episode keep up the good work
B00D76BEIQ,Scmeemaw "Scmeemaw",4,The writers plus the characters leave you with anticipation every episode. You wonder if &#34;A&#34; is still alive torturing the girls or is it CC leading them to think that &#34;A&#34; is alive putting up a smokescreen for her own diabolical schemes. Or is it someone you would not ever suspect?
B00D76BEIQ,Tagsmom,5,This is such a fun show! I thought when it first came on it was going to be a typical high school drama and yes they are in high school and yes there is alot of drama &#34;Awesome Drama&#34;. This seris is really good and it drives me crazy waiting a week for the next episode to come on
B00D76BEIQ,Tamara L Perez,5,Don't ever let this show or Twisted go off the air before it's time.  I was really upset the way ABC family pulled Kyle XY off the air without finishing it with all those cliffhangers.  Please do not do that with PLL or TWISTED!!!!  They are the only suspense shows as good as Kyle XY was.
B00D844FUQ,Cward55,5,If you aren't a fan of the first movie then stop reading this and move on because this review is for people that liked the first one. I dunno where to start. The first one I thought was fantastic and this one is even better even though now there is only 4 stories but they are done so well and I'm very pleased with them all. I will say the last 2 segments I think are the best of em. Yes this is an expensive rental but it is so worth it and you need to check this out like now.
B00D844FUQ,Route66Review,2,This movie was ok.  Ending was lame.  I should have waited until it hit Netflix or something cheaper. Rent it if you want to feel confused.
B00D845AQO,cherylannemarie,5,I think this is one of the best and scariest Paranormal Shows out there!  And I've seen most of them.
B00D845AQO,Gerisa Y. Thompson,4,this seasons stories are really interesting and the people seem so credible. i think though that the filming of the stories goes a little overboard.
B00D845AQO,h3liflyer,5,This show does a really great job on creating suspense and getting you scared! Love that real people are telling their stories!
B00D845AQO,John E. Scott,4,Nothing better then real people telling their ghost stories with many times compelling evidence. While I do think some people are too eager to want to see what they want to see. I think many times its the non believers that tell the most compelling stories. Because they don't just believe but try and debunk what is going on. This is not a show trying to scare as much as it is trying to document events people experienced in there home or on a trip. Just to witness the emotions these people are feeling even describing their ordeal simple reinforces their sincerity.
B00D845AQO,Journey "Journey",5,I don't scare easy. But I tend to watch this in bed with the lights off & the headphones on. There has been more than 1 episode that I have decided maybe I should finish watching the next DAY lol. I don't like &#34;ghost hunter&#34; type ghost shows & this one definitely isn't one of those. Throwing this show to top #1 on the list!
B00D845AQO,Maximilian K. Biltz,5,One of the best ghost documentaries out there. It is in clear imitation of &#34;A Haunting&#34; but does a good job creating their own style.
B00D845AQO,meg,5,It was something I needed to learn as a Christian. I wouldn't have known what the symbols were from so that I could have protected my family. Like the young boy did. Watching this made me realize that as a Christian I have to know what type of evil is in the world to walk the narrow path as he was walking on the roof. Ignorance is not a trait God wants us to have. Thank you for serving our country and teaching me a wonderful lesson.
B00D845AQO,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",4,This show  can sometimes be hit or miss - but when its a hit its pretty scary and intense.  Even when its not its best the show is a lot of fun.
B00D8VGN8G,Isaac Kirzner "Retired But Active",4,Each story begins by introducing the victim and the killer as normal people who seem to have no relationship with each other. It is fascinating to see that relationship unfold as the detectives follow the trail of the clues they unearth. We get to understand the motives behind the crime from both the victim's point of view and the killer's. Th actors playing the two detectives have excellent chemistry. I hope to see more of them.
B00D8VGN8G,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",5,I bought this series to bring me up to date  as I've started the latest shows on TV & realized it is in a second season!  I enjoy the shows as I can compare the police procedures between Canada & USA .  Home come our US cops are always shooting & banging people around??  I like the format for showing Victim & Killer in the beginning & then putting the puzzle together to show how these seemingly random people end up committing a crime.  Another study in the strange workings of the human mind.
B00D8VGN8G,violet rose,5,I accidently missed this when it was on channel 7 this summer & I am so glad amazon had it to watch.....this is a smart police drama....love the concept...fast paced...edgy.......keeps u very entertained.....and love the characters...great casting..............I hope channel 7 renews this show !!!!
B00D8VN1PY,Caroline Connor,5,Wonderful documentary ..wonderful work he is doing .  It takes great courage to step away from the crowd to bring the truth to the general public.  We are at a time in history what was done in secrete will no longer be.  I thought how many lies are being told to us on a daily basis.  How do they keep track of what is true or not true???? Highly recommend this documentary.
B00D8VN1PY,passionatereader,2,This is a movie that greatly disappointed me.I thought it would delve deeply into what happened with Bradley Manning's attainment ofdocuments and their subsequent release to Wikileaks (Assange) and then the world.  It wasmore of a personal criticism of both Assange and Manning and very uninteresting and biased.Do not waste your time or money.  The secret they steal is that this is not a movie worth watching.
B00D8VS7GC,Amazon Customer,1,Watched it coz Anna Kendrick is on it. It was a complete waste of time. 1+ hours of my life I can't get back.
B00D9JUWDO,Amazon Customer,5,This season was one adventure after another.  You are starting to see Kiera evolve and take notice of some actions of the corporate structure in the future.  The last episode was great!
B00D9JUWDO,brenda "open door",5,I loved season one of Continuum and find I like this year even better.  The characters are likable ( hateful if they are the bad guys)
B00D9JUWDO,Christopher,4,This show is awesome.  I will be royally upset if it gets cancelled like every other good show on SyFy.
B00D9JUWDO,C. J. Vazquez,5,I am usually not a fan of any show that employs time travel because of the inherent paradoxes but this one is different.  Our gorgeous time traveler is a great actress and doesn't flinch on the action scenes.  A must watch!
B00D9JUWDO,Dan Weddle,4,Never thought I liked Sci Fi.  This is very smart! Good acting and good plot development with lots of twists
B00D9JUWDO,D. Barabino,3,It is too contrived and really does not get better with more exposure. I regret buying the season. Don't bother.
B00D9JUWDO,D. Ernstzen "DE",5,I thought the 2nd second season is continuing to provide a great plot line for the series. The little twists and turns as they reveal more clues about what happened is starting to build nicely. It would be interesting to see if they can eventually return home or if it is just a oneway ticket. It would be sad to see if they can only move in one direction.
B00D9JUWDO,Diane L. Nusser,4,There are so many ways to go with this series. I truly hope they keep the series going.I am very much enjoying season two and cannot wait for the next episode!
B00D9JUWDO,D. Molder "D. Molder",5,Keep an eye on this series. I see so many directions this series can go and I hope it will go. It also touches on some of the realities and emotions about life and freedom we all have. It makes us think of what would we be willing to do. And who is really right in this series. It's definitely not a cut and dry black and white good and bad guy/girl series. It will have you paying attention trying to figure out what is going to happen next and where is the story going to go? Enjoy!
B00D9JUWDO,duncanhaus,5,I love this show. We do not have cable television .  I Watch these all the time and cant wait for the next season.
B00D9JUWDO,James F. MacLean,5,I love this show. It keeps me trying to guess what's going on. Just like the old X-Files. This is must see sci-fi.
B00D9JUWDO,Jodel,4,Lots of interesting twists and turns...good plot construction and interesting characters.  Having come from the 60's during my formative years the name &#34;Liber8&#34; for the bad guys just comes across as hokey. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
B00D9JUWDO,John O. McMurren,4,2nd Season is even better! More range of emotions and better story lines. I just wish it was free like season 1 on Netflix...
B00D9JUWDO,judileebee,4,intriguing.  I am drawn into the show more and more. can't wait to see what is up next for this series.
B00D9JUWDO,Katmomma,3,I loved season 1 and was looking forward to season 2.  Something is missing and hopefully someone will do something about it.
B00D9JUWDO,KELLY MCCRADIC,4,I enjoy this show ever much but it seems the writers keep writing themselves into the corner and its easy to loose interest but Im confident they will pull through!
B00D9JUWDO,Kent C Christen,4,The way the show presents the storyline can be confusing.  On the other hand you don't know what is going to happen next.  The characters are complex and one will find themselves rooting for both the good and bad guys.The issue of the role of government/corporations is complicated and how to deal with social change best is being explored.  It is worth watching.  I hope the writers don't get too strange in season two.
B00D9JUWDO,Manuel De La Paz,4,Enjoyed this immensely.During the off season of television I discovered this series.  It satisfies my Syfy addiction and the need for action.  Hope you enjoy it as well.
B00D9JUWDO,Pacific Mitchell,5,If you like SCI-FI you'll love this; I get the episode as soon as it comes out on Amazon Instant Video
B00D9JUWDO,Peter Mancini,5,Seasons 1 - 3 are really great. Season 3 is really different than seasons 1 and 2 due to the fact that time travel means unpredictable consequences and so they reflect that by an ever changing future. I would say season 3 is the hardest to get into but worth the effort.
B00D9JUWDO,Progressive Penguin "Progpen",4,I like this show and am glad they are coming back for another season.  Syfy needs to keep it up.
B00D9JUWDO,RWW,5,This series gets better with each episode so I'm really looking forward to the next season.  The last episode in particular really had me going.
B00D9JUWDO,Slack,5,Another twist in the story that keeps you guessing and hoping for more. They have hit on a really great and original show here. Thanks!
B00D9JUWDO,susan stewart,4,It really should be on Prime Amazon but since it is not I am glad to get caught up on this series.
B00D9JUWDO,tyelmene "tyelmene",5,It's hard not to start questioning the historical factors and internal/hidden workings of our actual current corporate-political system against Continuum's fictional future portral of an "all consuming corpora-operational society."  Fascinating and frightening!  This series is getting better and better.
B00D9KL4YE,finley,5,This movie was awesome! It was funny and romantic and sad. It shows how people that you would never think could...help and need one another without ever knowing it.
B00D9KL4YE,Sissy Kirsteen,2,I could not connect to the characters or the story for that matter.  It was boring and I ended up skipping a chunk here and there.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00DAHSVYC,A. Coleman "A. Mom",5,So far it's good! I look forward to watching the show each week! I hope it continues to come on for more seasons!
B00DAHSVYC,Adair,5,I'm glad that Prime brought this show out. It's a quality program that keeps you watching. Can't wait until Friday to watch the next one.
B00DAHSVYC,Adam Rutledge,5,pilot is great. I am a huge Stephen king fan and he sid an amazing job on this show. would love him to remake some of his others with modern special effects
B00DAHSVYC,AJ,1,An interesting idea that will probably be poorly executed.  I just can't stand the same ole made-for-TV unrealistic human dialog and behavior.  The writing is low-grade amaturish mixed with corporate ineptness.
B00DAHSVYC,Amazon Customer "&#34;Price Shopper&#34;",5,I like the characters and how they're developed as the story unfolds.  Really reels you into the storyline and keeps you guessing as to what might happen next.  Would highly recommend this series as watch worthy.
B00DAHSVYC,Amazon Customer,3,Was a decent watch. Was put together better than I thought it would be. Wasn't really low budget. Seemed like they put money into the show. Had a decent cast.
B00DAHSVYC,Amazon Customer,5,I found this show to be excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed a marathon weekend the other day. Awesome is the best I can come up with at the moment.
B00DAHSVYC,Amazon Customer "Hooked",5,I stumbled upon this show and have been watching every since. Great show and hope it remains on the air for a long time.
B00DAHSVYC,Amazon Customer "Nina",2,But went wrong somewhere got boring and predictable. Turned into a stereotypical small town bully story. Maybe book better not an S King fan anyway except for 11/23/63
B00DAHSVYC,Anne Dart,5,Great series!  I'm always looking forward to the next episode.  Characters are well cast.  People's reactions to various problems/situations that would arise in a town cut off from the rest of society are realistic and exemplify the vast range of human nature. What a marvelous cross-section of people find themselves thrown together in this major dilemma.
B00DAHSVYC,Antonia or Len Fishler,5,Wow. Steven King at his best. A literal pressure cooker with paranormal events. They keep increasing the conflict. Excellent characters and acting.
B00DAHSVYC,A. Robinson "hotarobin",4,interesting concept.  It is taking a while to fully develop by so far it's worth the wait.  I look forward to the next couple of weeks.
B00DAHSVYC,B. E. Harkins "Billy in South Ga",2,all I did was watch the trailer. It did not sound really all that interesting. Did not add it to my watch list.
B00DAHSVYC,Belinda Roman,4,This is pretty predictable sci fi but entertaining nonetheless.  Let's hope King surprises as he is know to do in his written work
B00DAHSVYC,beth holman,5,A very good show about a town that gets under a dome and how they live.  I'm looking forward to next season.
B00DAHSVYC,BK Perea,5,As good as the book! Each chapter kept me engaged. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Excellent!
B00DAHSVYC,Brandon R,5,Each episode builds up after one another and keeps me interested. Gets you to talk about how the characters are and secretive some if them are.
B00DAHSVYC,B. Seymour "Kudzuman",3,Certain things just seem to change without explanation especially the MOAB which cooked the area outside the Dome and then in the next episodes all is green outside again. It is all about the interpersonal relationships inside and could just has easily been done inside an enclave or on an island. Predictable results and characters.
B00DAHSVYC,B. Smith,4,King's work is always interesting and engrossing.As the season has gone on I feel the acting has gotten better so I don't cringe as much as I did at the beginning of the episodes.I stayed with it because of the plot. Now I am happy I did.
B00DAHSVYC,BudDel "Bud",4,Interesting Scifi approach. I'm guessing we will see more of &#34;Under the Dome&#34; in the future. Leave it to Stephan King to think of something like this.
B00DAHSVYC,cathy piontkowski,2,What? the last is Curtains.  That's not an ending. I kept waiting for another to follow.What a burn.  Very disappointed.  The book was excellent and had an ending .unreal.
B00DAHSVYC,CatPsyc,4,Some interesting characters and an intriguing plot.  It was a nice show to follow over the summer.  It is also a good family show if you have older children.
B00DAHSVYC,C. Groetzinger "noregroetz",3,This is kind of an interesting twist. People find themselves in an unusual situation and how they cope  . . .  or don't cope. We were especially perplexed by the dad who is so shocked at how easily his son kills other people when he seems to also kill at least one person in every episode.
B00DAHSVYC,charles ackley,5,keeps you on your toes never know what going to happen from one moment to the next good summer show
B00DAHSVYC,Chip,4,So far this show is very faithful to the book while maintaining a very fast pace.  Well worth a watch and of course a read.
B00DAHSVYC,chris,5,Love this show. A new fresh drama. Can hardly wait for season two next summer. A little different from the book.
B00DAHSVYC,Chris's Review,5,well Stephen King did it again.  I loved the series and can't wait till the next season. I did read the book and there was a lot of differences.
B00DAHSVYC,Chris St Pierre,5,Read the book first and the series is not meeting us down.Well done and worth the time.Do give this series a try.
B00DAHSVYC,Colleen Weston,5,I really like the story on this one and was sad to see this 1st season end.  All but the last episode was free.  Kind of a bummer that now I am hooked and will probably have to pay $1.99 per episode to see the continuing season and hopefully there is one.
B00DAHSVYC,Czosnek,4,So far I'm enjoying this show. I like the idea of not having to wait for the release of an entire season before you can watch. Just watched this weeks episode last night.
B00DAHSVYC,Darlene,5,Didn't read the book but the series draws you in and you can't wait for the next episode! Love it!
B00DAHSVYC,David R. Criser,3,Makes me look foreword to season 2.  Lots of questions left unanswered.  Intriguing idea. Stories are always done betterwhen the original author gets involved.
B00DAHSVYC,David Smith,4,I have not read the book but I did enjoyed the start. Will have to watt and see if it cam keep me watching.
B00DAHSVYC,D Dawg,5,I enjoyed this episode and enjoy how I can keep up on this show each week.  I personally own a  smart tv and choose not to pay for cable.
B00DAHSVYC,Deborah J. Towns,4,does anyone know if s.k. been or seen in any of the episodes? he usually sticks his face in.thanks
B00DAHSVYC,Deborah Minyard,4,Liked the first season and hope to see the second soon. This stays pretty close to the book which is nice for a change.
B00DAHSVYC,D. Ernstzen "DE",5,What a refreshing look at the psychology of people. This is just a great series and I was hooked at the pilot episode first launched. The fact that you can also get access to the series via Amazon Prime makes it even better. The characters are great and the acting is also not half bad. The whole plot keeps you glued to the television set and with a little revealed each episode you are actually waiting in anticipation for each episode to be released. Great show and a definite recommendation on my side.
B00DAHSVYC,Diana Wise,5,Great story! Fascinating characters! Not like anything on the so-called major networks. I think it should win awards. Hope Amazon plans to put out more originals! Free with Prime which is worth every penny!
B00DAHSVYC,Diane Bevans,4,This was a great start to this show.  It did take a lot of time building the characters to get you ready for season 2.  It does however leave a little bit out of the story line so sometimes it is a little hard to follow.  All in all its a pretty good show.
B00DAHSVYC,Diane M. Peterson,5,I think under the Dome is an interesting look at human behavior when a small group is isolated and the way order is or is not kept.
B00DAHSVYC,Donna "Dreamseeker",5,I rewatched all of Season One on Amazon Prime to get ready for the new season opening. I love this series. Thank you Stephen King for scaring me all my life and for creating amazing stories with your unmatched imagination.
B00DAHSVYC,Donna L. Sako,4,So far this season Under the Dome has kept my interest. I hope it continues to do so. Enjoying it.
B00DAHSVYC,Duffer513,3,While the concept of the show was unique and its potential was amazing the actual writing and plot development was disjointed and seemed contrived at times.  Some characters were introduced and then killed off so soon one wondered why they were even there.  Others started shallow and stayed there as the sister who was kidnapped and imprisoned.  She spent the entire first episodes screaming and nothing else to the point where I winced every time her character came on. Other people essential to the plot popped up out of nowhere and one wondered what was going on.  On a good note many of the characters were well done and the acting was first rate!
B00DAHSVYC,E. A Dunn "laineyd",2,This was not a very good show. The performances were generally subpar and the plot was too complex. I did not find any of it compelling.
B00DAHSVYC,Ebele Oraghalum,5,Can't wait to see whats gonna happen next season. This is like the best show on TV right now. Keep it coming.
B00DAHSVYC,Ellen M. Sorensen "mtnmaggie",3,we have enjoyed watching available episodes but wouldn't care if the show is cancelled as there are other series we enjoy even more.
B00DAHSVYC,Entertainment Aficionado,4,So far the show is hooking me. This bonus feature on Amazon was good but the show is better. I can't wait to see how the whole season unfolds.
B00DAHSVYC,Evelyn Felice,4,Original if fantasy story line.  Well executed and keeps ones interest from straying.  Enjoying it enough to continue the series.
B00DAHSVYC,Faye Parsons,4,I am not big fan of scifi but the storyline & actors (I.e Dean Norris as a baddie who did such a great job in Breaking Bad) was super.  Recommended for everyone. When the dome falls down it shows the good & the bad in the townfolk. Just watching how helpless the town is & seeing the people on the outside of the dome (even the military) trying and failing to do anything was heartbreaking.  I am eagerly awaiting season two.  Season one ended with a barely surviving leading man.
B00DAHSVYC,Faye P,4,My husband and I watched all of season 1 together. He does not care for binge watching so we watched over a span of 2 weeks. The premise is interesting but the story started losing something about half way thru the season. Hope season 2 will bring back the zing.
B00DAHSVYC,gator,4,I liked it but it wasn't as good as Dexter or House of Cards. Too cleaned up for network Tv. Needed to be more real in the dialogue. I did like the overall storyline.
B00DAHSVYC,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,I can't wait for more episodes.This is a well written show. The acting and characters are well developed. It is addicting.
B00DAHSVYC,gizzy,5,I missed this on TV and watched it on Amazon Prime. I really liked it. I'll definitely watch the next season.
B00DAHSVYC,Glenn,5,You don't absorb the whole series watching it one time. There is a lot of information to digest. I am looking forward to the next season.
B00DAHSVYC,G. Neal "EMPEROR",4,I'm a Stephen King fan and this television adaptation is an exhilarating ride.  Every week one is taken deeper into heart of the bizarre and fascinating.
B00DAHSVYC,grandma,4,It is getting better and better with every episode.  I enjoy the many things going on at one time.!!!! Tk's
B00DAHSVYC,Happy Camper,5,Great special effects and graphics help move this Stephen King story from page print to the home screen.  Characyers during Season 1 were introduced to show us the good (Dale Barbara/Barbie) and bad (Big Jim).Supporting cast members as nearly as important as those.two.  They provide the four who are in synch with the dome and egg.  Anything else would give away too much of the plot.Wickedly good writing in both storyline and character lines definitely help make this as good as it is.
B00DAHSVYC,Harlan Kamm,3,This season started out really good and progressively went down hill.  The last episode was really reaching for it.  A new character just showed up out of the blue and started to take control of everything.  I found this to be a bit foolish on the writer's part.  I have enjoyed the show up to that point.  It's interesting to see how different characters react when faced with limited supplies and being cutoff  from the rest of the world.  Its a good story but can only go on so far.
B00DAHSVYC,Harry,3,It's not a great show and not a horrible show. It's a decent filler show. Right now I think the main draw for me is finding out how and why the dome is actually there. If the next show answered all the questions and ended the series I'd be fine with it.
B00DAHSVYC,H.E.B.,3,My first impression following the premier was a one star rating. The next three episodes got better as well as the acting.Later episodes remains on par and my rating of three stars held throughout. I am happy to see the series on Prime so I could see the final five episodes sans commercials.
B00DAHSVYC,henrietta zielinski,4,a little different though predictable in a fashion.  characters should be developed a little more - they are transparent in their personality.
B00DAHSVYC,James Brittain "Jim Briton",2,The series started off great but then quickly became dumb.  It's a bummer as this series could have been a great one.  I don't know why dumb series get additional seasons but series like Terra Nova are cancelled.
B00DAHSVYC,Jan C,3,Our entire family watches this.  The teenagers love it.  I find it interesting but find the characters a bit one dimensional.
B00DAHSVYC,Jared Taylor,5,This was a fascinating program for the whole family. It had humorous momemts and was filledWith suspense and intrigue. Great writing and we look forward to the next season !
B00DAHSVYC,JCraul,5,A New twist on the end of days series that are so popular.  A Contained Crisis cut off from the rest of the world.  I look forward to each Friday night because a new episode is released.  Hope they continue with a Season 2.
B00DAHSVYC,Jeffery H,5,can t wait for next season! I thought the first season was exciting and gave a lot of depth to the characters.
B00DAHSVYC,jeff,5,i love this show a little dramatic for me but good story and plot lines. Good show for teenagers and adults.
B00DAHSVYC,j,5,I read the book and waited for awhile before watching the series - Stephen King is a master storyteller and the writers were able to capture the nuance of King's fine work.
B00DAHSVYC,Jim,5,I have not read the books. But I watch the first 2 episodes and it was very interesting to watch.You will like this tv show if you like action or science-fiction genres.
B00DAHSVYC,Jimmy C. Saunders "Papa Smurf",5,This is a very good story line and I can&#34;t wait until it starts again.  Very well written even though the story line is a bit far fetched.  But if taken as a syfy  story type it does have suspence and is well done.  I just can &#34;t wait until they come back with the second installment.
B00DAHSVYC,J. N. McCarthy,3,Not as good as other SyFi series.  Kind of slow and you don't get a sense of OMG. Female officer is not believable and the Lesbian couple are a little over the top along with the girl who plays the daughter.  I have already watched half of the first season's episodes and I'm afraid it hasn't captured my attention and will probably not finish the season. Lost and Alias are better and more exciting when you are watching episodes that hook you in where you can't wait for the next chapter.
B00DAHSVYC,Jodel,5,About the time you think you can predict what's going to happen the show takes you in a whole different place. The plot connections are masterful and keeps me wanting more after each episode.
B00DAHSVYC,Joe 1015,5,Great new series with lots of intrigue. Great streaming quality from Amazon Prime. Highly recommended to scifi & drama fans.
B00DAHSVYC,Joe   L. "Joe L.",5,Sick and twisted like many Stephen King stories. This series is great and watching it on Amazon prime is even better. No commercials. Also it's easy to get friends hooked. Great acting except a few characters.
B00DAHSVYC,john mager,5,i was supprisd it was very good movie. for this kind of make belive ? well maid qualty picture and sound if you lke these kind of movie you will like this.
B00DAHSVYC,Jo-Rell "The Word",5,For those who have read &#34;one second after &#34; its very close to that book .. overall the Show is very interesting .. leaves you thinking.and waiting for the next show.. i recommend giving it a try ..
B00DAHSVYC,Jorge Gomez,3,The subject is unique although at times it seems so implausible. The creators of the show are unable to make it seem believable.
B00DAHSVYC,Kathleen Fuller "Kathleen7",5,This is a bit addictive with an apocalyptic theme. This is definitely a drama filled with intrigue and a lot of suspense.
B00DAHSVYC,Kaylis,5,Its a good show. It certainly smacks of King's style. I am looking forward to this season. I hope it moves on at a faster clip than the first season but other than that- no complaints here. I wouldn't go out and purchase Amazon Prime for the sole purpose of watching it. I am just glad I had it already. ;)
B00DAHSVYC,K. Munsey,5,This is a great show!  Full of suspense!  I haven't read the book so my opinion is for the show only and I think it is really good!
B00DAHSVYC,Kobe 519 "Genevieve Cherry-Sours",1,I had been following mini series on cbs and it said to watch finale go to amazon. so o rented the last episode thinking it was the end because it was suppose to be a 1 season show and it turned out i already saw it not knowing cbs was carrying it over to next season so i paid for something i already saw. But I like the show.
B00DAHSVYC,Kungfujackrabbit,5,Great suspense and I like all the new twists and turns in the story. Very fun to keep up with this show.
B00DAHSVYC,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",5,I have enjoyed the ones available and am looking forward to the next episodes.  It is a very interesting story and so-far has kept my interest.
B00DAHSVYC,Lawrence,5,I really liked the mystery on how or why the dome covered a town. The story gets deeper as you watch all the episodes. Just wondering why they did not finish the final story. Hope they will continue making episode 13.
B00DAHSVYC,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",4,This show has a few cast members I have seen in other shows and I really have been enjoying the unique nature of the story.
B00DAHSVYC,LINDA K,5,Can't wait for season 2. So realistic even when they revealed the Alien. Loved how they approached each situation that occurs under a dome with a very believable answer and or solution.
B00DAHSVYC,Lori "lolepere",5,I liked this show.  It was fast paced had numerous story lines starting and it was easy to relate to the characters.  Was kind of shocked at how some of the actors were killed off so soon!
B00DAHSVYC,lorrie lennon,3,There islet tail in this series. There are times when it seems 'acted'. In other words it fails to hold my attention. Needs better writing and acting.
B00DAHSVYC,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,5,CAN NOT WAT FOR THE 2ND SEASON TO PLAY .SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE BAD GUYS THANKS FOR HAVING IT AMAZON PRIME .. !
B00DAHSVYC,magicboo2u,5,Good show that keeps you guessing as to what happens next! Never miss an episode thanks to Amazon Prime and its free to watch!
B00DAHSVYC,Manuel De La Paz,3,I find myself faithfully watching each week to  see what is going to happen next. Why I do this I don't know.  I find it slow and plodding yet there is something there that makes me want to know what is next.  I would say this show is not for everyone.  I guess I will keep watching until something like a week plot twist makes me pull the plug.
B00DAHSVYC,Marilyn Lee "The BookRook",5,A start that keeps you interested.  Not quite like the book but you can feel the King influence.  Lots of new actors and a few oldies but goodies.
B00DAHSVYC,Mary Ceparano,5,This is a great DVD series. It is very interesting. Love Stephen King books and DVDs. I love anything Stephen King.
B00DAHSVYC,Mary,5,What a show!  I'm bummed that the season ended.  I also liked watching it without commercials and being able to repeat an episode if I wanted to
B00DAHSVYC,Matt,5,My wife and I really enjoyed this show and we are glad we watched it on prime.  There is good character development story line keeps you hooked
B00DAHSVYC,Maureen Barrett,5,I just love Stephen King and Under the Dome -- I am mesmerized by it---just can't stop watching this miniseries.
B00DAHSVYC,M. Eaton "Caithness lass",5,Nice little twist on people forced into having to rely on each other whether they want to or not.  The character study is rather good and you can never be too sure who is going to still be around for the following week's episode.
B00DAHSVYC,megb "megb",4,Many interesting characters and unexpected events challenge your thinking on survival dynamics  of small groups of people. The series focuses on the social implications of inexplicable disaster. It reminds me of Journal of the Plague Year by Camus because the social and ethical thinking changes as the trouble progresses.
B00DAHSVYC,M,3,I look forward to the series
B00DAHSVYC,Michael S Osborne,5,I love the book and this series is well done.  A series was a much better choice than a movie for this story.
B00DAHSVYC,Mix-in-it,5,I normally don't get into shows since I lack the time but this one I can't miss!  I didn't know there was a book version until I read the reviews.  Either way this show doesn't disappoint.
B00DAHSVYC,M. McKenzie,3,Just the redheaded reporter is enough to warrant a look-see into this Stephen King based series.. Dont get hooked because series gets cancelled I bet LOL
B00DAHSVYC,mouliin,3,i think this rendition of the book could have been better.  the actors try their best; but dialogue is melodramatic and a bit pretentious it seems.  book much better.
B00DAHSVYC,Mrfil7 "Swissman in D.C.",4,I think this show has a lot of promise. The dialogue and acting is good and I feel immersed in the story. I can also relate to the main characters and they did a lot of character development/back story in this season (though it's done in a thrilling way so you don't mind it so much.The season ends on a cliffhanger that leaves you hoping for answers in season 2. Because it seems they focused more on developing the story in the final few episodes I would expect them to further the story quite a bit in season 2. I really hope they have a proper story and this is not an empty mystery a la &#34;Lost&#34;.
B00DAHSVYC,MS,4,Plot dragged on quite a bit. The plot didn't explain how the Councilman got the whole town to so &#34;dociley&#34; go along with his hanging scheme.  I didn't like that ending at all.  The whole plot seemed to revolve around the Councilman's personality and evil lying.  A bit unreal and a bit boring.
B00DAHSVYC,Nancy Tice,3,I really enjoy scifi but this one is just so so. Lots of unbelievable ( not researched like a Star Trek ) circumstances. You don't connect much to the characters and some of the episodes very very drawn out. Don't think I'll bother with the coming season
B00DAHSVYC,neon,4,You get hooked right away on the plot .The characters bring out all your emotional feelings .Will look forward to the part 2 episodes
B00DAHSVYC,Nicole,3,Great to watch if there is nothing on tv to watch. Will keep in queue for days their is nothing to watch.
B00DAHSVYC,Pamela J. Patneaude,5,Love the suspense;  what's going on with the fuel issue?  What was the &#34;good doc&#34; up to? Love the newspaper woman also.  Cutting the cow in half was pretty harsh and vivid!  Just a very interesting show.  I like when a lot of different issues are going on at the same time.  Very Cool!
B00DAHSVYC,Patricia Ann,3,It looks like an interesting show but I don't understand why it isn't available online.I hope the sheriff isn't dead.
B00DAHSVYC,Patrick R Smith,5,Yes it was wonderful and I enjoyed it very much would watch again in a heart beat well thats all for now.
B00DAHSVYC,Patscats,4,I am enjoying this take of the book by Stephen King. Needless to say if you are a King fan that the TV Series is only able to capture a small part of the entire story but that said I like the characters that they chose to follow. There is just enough difference in the series that it keeps me guessing each week. I am watching on Amazon Prime so get to enjoy it without all the annoying commercial breaks.
B00DAHSVYC,Phillip R. Robeson "Phil - Sr. Enterprise Inf...,5,My wife and I enjoy this show very much. I hope they keep it going for at least 3 to 5 years.
B00DAHSVYC,P. Jackson,4,This has a reasonably interesting story arc that links a series of studies about people locked in a closed environment together. There are all the personality types here and they are being played out as expected. What is generally missing is that the reason for the dome seems to bother no one in particular and they focus on their own local petty squabbles etc.The photography is superb and the acting is well done with reasonable characters. It will not satisfy the real scifi buffs as the dome is not explored very much up to this point. The story is from a Stephen King novel but it has already deviated enough to make it possible that the end will not be quite as silly as the book. Who knows?
B00DAHSVYC,P. K. Nolen,5,I loved the book and I am really enjoying the TV series. Can't wait for each one to show. Missed this last one but watched it on Amazon. Now for Monday night to be here.
B00DAHSVYC,Ralph,4,Began watching this at the suggestion of my older daughter who is a Stephen King fan. It is fun to watch on Amazon Prime and on my schedule. It is convenient also since I receive a notice when the next episode is available. It will be good to have the &#34;mystery&#34; of the Dome and the intent behind it revealed.
B00DAHSVYC,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",3,If you have readUnder the Dome: A Novelby Stephen King you will find that it's sorts of poor adaptation of the excellent novel so far. The acting done by characters are OKAY but nothing spectacular. Some episodes are technically imperfect and something to quibble about but still Amazon offering this free for prime members was a good move. I did finish watching the whole season 1 using Amazon Instant video and I am looking forward to the conclusion. I hope the producers of the series adapts to the original novel in their forthcoming episodes.Okay to watch it once if you are into SciFi. May be get it again when it is available at my local library for a second look but would not invest on DVDs or Blu-Ray.
B00DAHSVYC,reader,4,Not bad but disappointing. I have yet to read the book and can only hope it is better than the visualisation on TV.
B00DAHSVYC,ReaperMan,4,Just like a stephen king movie. To long not enough action. But I would sit and watch the whole thing.  Its good.
B00DAHSVYC,Richard "Fun_to_know",4,Halfway through the first season and it has managed to capture my attention and hold it - sort of a twist of &#34;Lost&#34;
B00DAHSVYC,Richard Goodlette,4,Another expose of human behavioral changes in the midst of unusual and stressful circumstances. All of the townspeople are suspect: everyone has a secret. Much of the tension relates to determining if those secrets will be revealed to those who most need to know! (They rarely are!!!) The OMG moments never seem to end. Can't wait for the new season next month!!!
B00DAHSVYC,rm,5,I love watching this show every week and so good. It make me wish it was longer then 1 hour. Lol. If you haven't watch it you need too. Its created by Stephen King himself.
B00DAHSVYC,Robert,2,It could have been an exciting sci-fi thriller instead its been turned in to a drawn out badly written soap.
B00DAHSVYC,ROBERT R LARSON JR,2,Started out strong but has started to wander around aimlessly.  They should have made it a miniseries instead of a full season show.  I hope they don't go to a second season.  They're losing focus.  I'm not sure I'll continue watching this season.  Will not watch a second season
B00DAHSVYC,Rockster12,5,This show is awesome. Every time I watch an episode I have to watch the next one. Very interesting show.
B00DAHSVYC,Roger E. Ervast,5,I liked this show from the start. I loved Hank Schrader from &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; from the first scene in which I saw him. His character (&#34;Big&#34; Jim) in this show is a nice departure from the do-gooder DEA agent he portrayed in BB.  The rest of the cast is great in this show and they seem to work together very well.
B00DAHSVYC,Ronald F. Paull,2,If I were to state clearly why I do not like the series I would start a fire storm and get a bunch of hate responses.My perception is that the series is being used in part to advance an agenda that is offensive to an awful lot of folks. It would not detract from the plot at all for it not to have been included.
B00DAHSVYC,R. Roeth,4,I am a Stephen King fan and this show reminds me why! Always unexpected twists! And the show has the ability to make one skip logic and just go along for the ride.
B00DAHSVYC,Ruben,5,Outstanding can't wait for season 2 definitely worth watching. Great story good acting. It is highly addictive. Great show and lots of action
B00DAHSVYC,Sally Ruse,4,I like under the dome thanks amazon for putting in prime. I can not wait to see what happen in the series.
B00DAHSVYC,Sam P. Morgan Jr.,5,A thin story line with many improbably actions but very entertaining just the same.  Someone needs to make &#34;Big Jim&#34; hurt.  And he really is not that big.  Walter White took him out easily.
B00DAHSVYC,sao,4,This is an interesting show. I enjoyed watching it so far. I hope it  continues for a few seasons. Best part it is  a prime movie so it is free.
B00DAHSVYC,Savy Shopper,5,I did not read the book so I don't have a comparison there; but the characters are well developed & really get strong feelings for them.  I can't wait each week for the next episode!!
B00DAHSVYC,Sherry H.,4,not a stephen king fan and almost did not watch this because of that.  some episodes were rather tedious and the storyline seemed to get muddled occasionally but overall entertaining
B00DAHSVYC,Shirl in DC "SAS",5,The episodes are getting better.  I love this show. I recommend it to everyone.  Dale Barbie is soooooo handsome and so is the guy that plays Junior.  Great show!
B00DAHSVYC,S. Lasher,4,Great Mini-series. Missed it this summer but now I can get it all here. Thanks Amazon Prime! If you have not seen it yet I highly recommend it.
B00DAHSVYC,Some Guy,4,I just recently signed up for Amazon Prime and have only watched 1 episode of this series but I like the looks of it so far.
B00DAHSVYC,srrogers50,4,Enjoyable sci fi series.
B00DAHSVYC,Stella Shahan "sastar27",5,This was so awesome. I loved the whole story idea around this and the characters were so real almost like real life.  Ending will make you come back for more.
B00DAHSVYC,Sue Boyle "blue9244",4,I have finished watching season 1 and certainly hope there is a season 2 to look forward to.  The premise is fascinating and the characters are fun.  My only complaint is that some of it is rather far fetched and some of the acting not so good.  But overall I really enjoyed the first season.
B00DAHSVYC,Susan,5,I am looking forward to Season 2 to be available on Prime.  The writers have a good insight into the dichotomy of human nature.
B00DAHSVYC,susan stewart,4,I like it but it's a little bit too dark for me- no "good guys" so I won't be watching it a second time. The last episode was such a HUGE disappointment. I understand cliffhangers but this was quite ridiculous!!!!!
B00DAHSVYC,SusieQ "Carwalker",4,I liked this because it was clever. For some reason it seem to just magnify problems. Thisgroup was together and had to serve their needs. It seemed to make them stronger.
B00DAHSVYC,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,One of the best HBO shows I have seen!  I was so disappointed when the end came and I now have to wait for more.  At least I hope there is more...there has to be.  You won't be sorry with this one.
B00DAHSVYC,sylvia korby,4,I like Stephen King and this is a good series. It keeps you wondering whats going to happen next. Thanks
B00DAHSVYC,S. Young,4,There are many shows out there that seem very much the same but I can't say the same for this one. I don't watch as much television because shows don't hold my attention for long and I am not sure where this one will go but so far I can't wait for the next season. So these people got isolated from their surrounding by some strange dome which appeared out of nowhere with no warning. Sometimes I am not sure about the supernatural parts of it but not to where I want to turn away from it. The cast of characters is interesting as their story unfolds and skeletons come out of the closet. Not sure if this is a good vs. evil kind of thing or some kind of moral test of the characters but so far I like it.
B00DAHSVYC,Tab,5,My wife watched this show on tv and she really enjoyed this show. She told me that this was definately a show to add to our collection and of course the book was written by Stephen King. You can not go wrong there.
B00DAHSVYC,Taketoshi Takahashi "takahashh007",5,This is one of many alien invasion stories but it was very difficult to stop viewing the episodes. I can hardly wait for the next episode to be available.
B00DAHSVYC,Texas Gal "catlady1981",4,This works pretty well. For some reason no book of King's that I have read has ever translated to the screen well with the exception of &#34;The Stand&#34;. But this is entertaining.
B00DAHSVYC,The Currdog,4,Stephen King but not really this time because the events that occur do not seem to be controlled by the devil.
B00DAHSVYC,thepoetnmotion,3,So far too much of the focus has been on a young girl held captive in a shelter and the tweaked out guy who is holding her captive.
B00DAHSVYC,TIna Cubero,5,This was a action packed first season was surprised that it was written by Steven King. Can't wait for the next season
B00DAHSVYC,T. Lansburg "elecbanker",5,I wouldn't say don't watch this series since it has a lot of live value learning everyone could appreciate and meld into their lives.  I am sorry to see this program end.  Shame on those that made decisions on numbers or ratings!
B00DAHSVYC,twesjewel,5,This has been a great season.  It will be interesting to see where they go in season two.  Really enjoyed having the series available on Amazon Prime.
B00DAHSVYC,Vic Graninger,3,Good but deviated form the Stephen King book - it disappointed me the producers and writers felt it necessary to change Barbie's and Shumway's characters
B00DAHSVYC,William Clem,5,This series reminded me much of the series Jericho. UTD inspired me to purchase the book (1074 pages). I couldn't put it down either. I watched the series on amazon prime (a great buy in itself). The characters in the series were well developed. I am looking forward to season 2.
B00DAHSVYC,Winston M. Gonzalez,3,well if u had to rate this it would be a solid 3 aside from the dome the story seems kinda dull.  again is TV  what else can I say!!!
B00DAHSVYC,Wolfgang "Film & TV",2,Incredibly weak! This is successful network tv now? I m afraid quality in future tv shows will be horrible for a long time and only cable and new broadcasters like amazon or netflix will provide good content.....
B00DBT2QZY,Amazon Customer,4,I enjoyed the Closer and I enjoy Major Crimes. The cast of this program pull this series together and it keeps you guessing at what's next.
B00DBT2QZY,Amazon Customer "Reading mistress",5,Big fan. Love how the transition between Closer and Major Crimes is going. Enjoying Mary McConnnell's role and how the writers continue to develop her relationships to Brenda's old crew while incorporating the new.
B00DBT2QZY,Brian Jones,5,I love the show.  Mary McDonnell is soft hearted and kind in this series while at the same time maintaining the integrity of her character.  Love it love it love it.  Wish there were more episodes
B00DBT2QZY,Cadima,5,I was sad when The Closer was discontinued but I have to say I do like Major Crimes.  Mary McDonnell's character has redeemed herself in my eyes.
B00DBT2QZY,Christine Perez,5,This is a really good show. This crime drama real pulls you in. You don't know what flynn and provrnza ail do. They are hilarious.  I like raydor she brings maturity and charm.
B00DBT2QZY,Clarese busy busy "Comfort and Convenience Se...,4,McDonnell (Captain Sharon Raydor) developed from an interesting bureaucrat to a more interesting force who could successfully follow the rules unless the choices crossed the ethical and moral lines to being wrong. She solves crimes without butting heads directly with her superiors. She creates a family of choice rather than birth. Something that I have on my hopeful list. Captain Raydor is another of my heroes in fiction.
B00DBT2QZY,Cocorah,5,Its even better than the former series.  Both the continuing story line and the episodes make for a great show.
B00DBT2QZY,David Lehmann,5,Characters much more interesting than original  &#34;The Closer&#34; series.  Each episode about 45 minutes (no commercials!!).  Two seasons prior to this year on tv.  Couple of sub plots to make it interesting. Recommend.
B00DBT2QZY,D. Barabino,5,I do not regret purchasing Major Crimes. Mary McDonnell isa joy to watch work. I look forward to next season.
B00DBT2QZY,Debbie Dillon,5,Love this show. I don't think it missed a beat when lead roles were changed and the second season was so good. Great acting by all.
B00DBT2QZY,DeDe "DeDe",4,That new Deputy DA is so annoying- I can't stand when she is on the screen.  Absolutely horrible acting- all around huge detraction from an otherwise very successful spin-off of a much loved show.  That is not always very successfully done- other than this character "job well done!"  5 stars if she goes- can even keep the character- just get rid of that actress.
B00DBT2QZY,Eleanor Weber,5,It had big shoes to fit after closer but it has done the job. Love the whole team. Wonderful show.
B00DBT2QZY,Francis Tuifao,5,Major Crimes is a great show to watch. It has the dynamics with the characters and how they deal with the crime scene. It seemed like the section is a family to these characters that they would look out for each other. It is a good show.
B00DBT2QZY,Genavee,5,I am really this season everyone is coming into their own. Keep Sharon and Rusty together! Great show so far!
B00DBT2QZY,helenredhawk,4,I loved The Closer so I was a bit concerned when Major Crimes spun off from it. The first season of Major Crimes had a few issues to work out in terms of the characters interaction. The second season is better. The characters are &#34;settling in&#34; to their roles and the story lines are interesting. I am hoping that the writers can improve the show by developing the characters more. Since I know them from The Closer I know their background but I think someone new to Major Crimes might think they are a bit &#34;2-dimensional&#34;.
B00DBT2QZY,Jane Smith "Jane Smith",5,I like the cast of the show. I like that the show is not over-the-top. The show moves at a good pace. I like the humor.
B00DBT2QZY,jessie barkley,5,loved the Closer... but was getting tired of Brenda Lee's outrageous skirtingof the law....  that was a great character.... but a bit shallow.....  Mary McDonnellis making it a serious believable role... i like her a lot.....
B00DBT2QZY,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",5,During &#34;The CLoser &#34; I was uncertain about Mary's character and watching her character develop more depth while learning to command the team is great.  Women can be good leaders and still have that softer side.  I love her team of detectives all are unique with different good/ bad points & yet have learned to work so well together.  A breath of fresh air instead of constant one upmanship seen so much today.
B00DBT2QZY,Michelle Gould,5,It so nice to know when you tune into Major Crimes you see familiar characters that are uplifting and entertaining. You always feel excitement when it is time for the next episode.
B00DBT2QZY,Page 2,5,very interesting. It is different I think that is what I like She is a good character. I didn't find I was comparing this show to The Closer
B00DBT2QZY,Patricia M. Brown,5,I watched The Closer from the first episode and wasn't sure I would like this show because I was sorry to see it end. All the same people play in Major Crimes with the exception of Brenda and Chief Pope. I think that is one of the reasons I like it so well because I really liked The Closer and this show really just continues that one.
B00DBT2QZY,Prefl96,5,We have been waiting for the second season of Major Crimes and are not disappointed. So glad they brought it back!
B00DBT2QZY,Sandra,5,MY FAVORITE SHOW ON TV. THIS WAS INSTANT STREAMING FOR MY KINDLE.
B00DBT2QZY,Shannon Castleberry,5,This is one really well done show. I love that all the supporting actors from The Closer were kept for this show as I love each and every one of them. It is a well acted and fun show to watch. I love Mary Mc Donnell and all the cast. I didn't think it would be as good without Brenda Lee but it is and I highly recommend it anyone looking for a good drama show to watch.
B00DBT2QZY,S. Marsh,5,I really am enjoying the same people from The Closer. Another show that is like eating peanuts. Love the stories and the people.
B00DBT2QZY,susan,4,it has some quirks needs something maybe i just need to adjust from the old to the new but sometimes its ridged acting i like it but it hasent hit the love stage
B00DBT2QZY,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",5,I was really nervous that the show would not keep up its great character development from the first season. I really enjoy the characters in this series and very much wanted it to work. If you haven't watched the first season yet get on it and know that you have even more programming to look forward to. Mary McDonnell is great.
B00DBT2QZY,T. Buckner "cmc",4,I totally enjoyed the closer.. and was so disjointed when it was coming to and end.  When they did major crimes and I seen all the same actors les kyra Sedgwick.  I wondered if they would be any good. I have it a try and to my surprise is a really good show.  It is one of my tv shows that I have to watch every week.  I was bummed it isn't free. There should at least be a bigger discount to buy weekly shows because it's cheaper to edit for the DVD to come out.  I plan on continuing to watch.  They have a good story line and keeps you wanting to know more.
B00DBT2QZY,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",5,Major crimes is a sort of follow on series to &#34;Closer&#34;. There is a lot of humor ans psychology in each episode. I enjoy and recommend it.
B00DCLZMQG,Amazon Customer,5,Looking forward to watching the 2nd season and see what happens next.  Keep up the good work you are a wonderful cast.
B00DCLZMQG,J. Doll,4,I started watching this show when it first started and I got hooked.  It's an interesting story with compelling characters and just enough mystery to keep you coming back.
B00DCLZMQG,Julianne Knutson,4,The suspence of knowing what the mystery has totally hooked me into this tv show. I want to know more and more of what has everyone all jumpy and what did he really do and why? Ah can't wait to watch more!
B00DCLZMQG,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",4,It's an okay show by the time I got invested the season was over. If I get bored I may watch next seasons. It's interesting but its just something keeping it from holding my attention completely.
B00DDKXECU,1443giggles,5,I really like this show a lot.  I has a great plot and I love the characters.  I am really glad I purchased this show!
B00DDKXECU,D'artagnan,3,Nice show that has gone on a wee bit too long . . . maybe we need term limits for TV too (o;
B00DDKXECU,Debbie Dillon,5,I really really like this show. I have watched it since the beginning and I feel it is as good as the first season. I had Directv before and now I buy the season ticket and still save money.
B00DDKXECU,dog lover,5,This is one of our favorite shows.  We love the cast and the story line. We love it when Boris is in the show.
B00DDKXECU,Lisa M. Ludwig "booklover",5,This is an excellent series.  It has been strong for all 5 seasons. Always a fresh story line with several plots each episode.  Love the acting and the cast chemistry.  Looking forward to season 6!!
B00DDKXECU,Slack,5,Really enjoyed this season. I am looking forward to the next season. The ending was unexpected so I am intrigued to see where they will go from here!
B00DDKY4OC,D. Light,4,I like her new job. The intrigue. The romance. And her more varied therapy clients. It all adds up to a more watchable and enjoyable show. Bravo!
B00DDKY4OC,Dreamcat,5,By far the best USA has to offer; loved the show from the very beginning! The characters are well portrayed and the storylines are interesting.
B00DDKY4OC,Patricia Appelquist,4,Its not a comedy but it would have been funny (funnier) if they didn't make Mechad Brooks do standup for all his lines. Oh look a new love interest puhlesse don't make me puke I think I can only handle so much drama at this point because well that new assistant was not funnyIts nice to see john stamos still working he I could watch....maybe if they didn't disguise dialogue as a rapid fire machine gun ...really people this isn't SUITS
B00DDKY4OC,Patricia M. Brown,4,I like this show and wish it had more episodes every year. I enjoy the drama and comedy involved. It's all new this year and wasn't sure I would like it but I did like it even though the show is in a different setting.
B00DDKY4OC,SLS,5,The changes made to the show's format only served to enhance the season.  The romantic tension between Dr. Dani and Nico was utterly delicious.  John Stamos brings a complexity to his character that leaves you wondering if he is a conniving mastermind or a victim of his outrageous enthusiasm.  This season was filled with intrigue that elevated the action of the show to a more engaging level.  My only criticism is that the action comes and goes in spurts.  Some episodes are packed with action while others move at a glacial pace.
B00DEJWI2W,Route66Review,5,This sequel rocked the two before. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the bayou...beware the monster. I look forward to part four.
B00DGC8XEE,Angela Anderson,5,I love this show & like to watch it while working out. The episodes are easy to purchase & they're ready to watch right away.
B00DGC8XEE,B. Merrill,5,I love cop shows and criminal drama's but private detective shows are great a little few and far between but great. The scene is D.C and two former government agents as private investigators. Great interaction with FBI and local police makes this show a great watch.
B00DGC8XEE,brenda "open door",5,I like the characters. The two leads play off one another well.  Edgar is a prize and makes the show.  The story line is good and engaging.  It entertains and that's why we turn the tv on.
B00DGC8XEE,Debbie Dillon,5,I hope this show is renewed. I like the actors and the story lines. I feel it is well written.
B00DGC8XEE,D. Lienhard "h2obaby1960",5,i love this showthe idea of 2 people being complete oppisiteswork well together& edgar & benny are a nice add for a group of highly disfunctional adults
B00DGC8XEE,Donna Curtis,5,....do they take so many good shows off the air and continue the ones that are only marginal? King & Maxwell was a great show. I hate that it only lasted one season but that was a great season. Well worth the watch.
B00DGC8XEE,Janet C. Walker,3,It's OK and that is about all I can say now.  Fritzi needs a shave and Opie came back brain damaged and believable at it.  They are not too bad at telling a story in 45 minutes.
B00DGC8XEE,jessie barkley,3,he is a strong serious actor..... look at his role in the closer.....she is cast as superwoman.....  but she is tooooo cutethe computer guy is simply toooo wierd.......
B00DGC8XEE,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",3,I like all the actor's in this series. Like others have said there is nothing new here.I think they all do a great job and the most interesting character of all is Edgar without him I don't think this series would fly at all.
B00DGC8XEE,Page 2,5,They play off each other but seem like they get the job done. Their sidekick and bookkeeper is a jewel. He makes the show work. I want to see more of this series
B00DGC8XEE,Richard E. Moriarity "rikE2iis",2,she has to go.  need a more dyaminc character to work.  She just doesn't have the &#34;it&#34; factor.  Show will more then likely be cancelled because of her.
B00DGC8XEE,S. Marsh,5,David Baldacci is one of my favorite writers. He helped write the show. It was just on last summer and I don't know how I missed this program. It is just the kind of show I like!
B00DGC8XEE,suzirelli,5,Edgar is my favorite part of this show!  Ryan Hurst plays the Edgar character and he's so funny! Who would have known this would be his follow up to SOA?
B00DGC8XEE,T. Brady "Tom",3,It is still early in the season yet to make a full judgement on the series but for what I saw in the first episode I liked it and thought it has the potential to go farther than expected.  I hope it does because the first episode piqued my curiosity about what will come next.
B00DGC8XEE,T. Buckner "cmc",3,Bummer that they got cancelled. I liked the episodes that I did see. I think that tnt will need looking for a replacement of the closer for a long time
B00DGC8XEE,Terrance L. Mcgowan,5,Great new series.  One has to love the enter play between the two main characters.  Not a lot of unnecessary  violence.  Similar to &#34;Castle&#34;
B00DGC8XEE,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",5,I liked the interplay between King and Maxwell. The plots were interesting. The action was at times a bit excessive. But i would definitely buy season 2 except that the series was cancelled for season 2.
B00DGMVMCY,Amazon Customer "curling acs",5,Good cast and very entertaining.  I enjoy this show.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a pleasant tv series.
B00DGMVMCY,Amazon Customer,4,I enjoyed this show when it first came on and think will enjoy it again as a rerun. These actors have progressed on in their careers.
B00DGMVMCY,djr311,4,Watched every episode when it was a featured program on national TV and was thrilled to see the first season on Amazon.  When will the follow-up seasons be released.  I love this show.
B00DGMVMCY,Lauri Mannikko,3,Missed this one season of the series due to a military posting those years. It's funny enough but I watched just so I know I have completed the series.
B00DGMVMCY,raten51,5,I just love this show. The humor was great and the characters are also very good. I recommend this show if you want to laugh a lot.
B00DGMW7P0,Cindy Gentry,4,If you enjoy watching the royal family you will enjoy this documentary . I would have liked more about her childhood but I enjoyed this.
B00DGMW7P0,Steve,5,This is a fascinating film with historical footage and the long and storied life of the Queen. If you have interest in the Royal Family this should be enjoyable.
B00DGMW7P0,T. Buckner "cmc",4,Everything you wanted to know about the queen.  She is a great woman.  I was glad it includes info on princess di.  I wish it takes more about who will be king.
B00DGMW7P0,Vyctorya,5,I love documentaries about royalty.  This "royal doc" was royal indeed.  It was a very interesting look at the Queen of England from the eyes of a few in the media there.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B00DGN97VQ,Big A "Wesley",4,This was a very interesting take on war on drugs. It is like a Scott Pilgrim documentary about how twisted and backwards the war on drug is fought here in America. I would recommend this a very insightful look into a broken system in our country.
B00DGN97VQ,carolwho2,1,This movie is one of the worst i have ever seen. But Im  not sure what i expected from the title. I was wondering how people got away with selling drugs. All this was is a diary of a few drug addicts and dealers.
B00DGN97VQ,Crusader,5,This film is so truthful that it is chilling!I have never in my life seen a more honest and compelling documentary regarding drug use and sales.This film clearly serves as another strong argument to oppose the so-called War on Drugs that costs billions for the taxpayer each year while benefiting special interest groups.This film is definitely of the caliber to be nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe!
B00DGN97VQ,e.m.,2,i wasn't sure what to think of this. was it a parody? am i to take it seriously? it played like a 3am &#34;you can become a millionaire in real estate with no money down&#34;. look at my really over priced watch. i only had to serve 15 yrs in a violent prison for it. winning?
B00DGN97VQ,J. Dean "playagirl",5,This was an extremely informative and incredibly entertaining and heartbreaking look at America's &#34;War on Drugs&#34;. Very well directed and written. Fast paced and never dull.
B00DGN97VQ,Luv2learn "Sandy P",4,Not quite what I expected but if you are patient and watch in its entirety it conveys a very interesting discussion.
B00DGN97VQ,Marlon,5,A creative attempt to tell the story from a different perspective. If you want to sell drugs all you have to do is.....  The narration using sarcasm makes it sound so easy but the dangers and potential consequences are ever present. While somewhat balanced in its approach to the issue of drugs in America it does seem to take a stance on the side of reduced legislation. Informative to say the least.
B00DGN97VQ,mr. contrarian,3,A lot of this ground has been plowed in other articles and documentaries.  Former drug dealers never seem to get tired of answering questions about the old lifestyle.  I would have liked more detail on the difficulties of moving from one level to the next.  Is it ruthlessness? having a reputation for being tough? causing someone who double crosses you to mysteriously disappear? rewarding your more loyal foot soldiers? all of the above?  I also liked the hidden compartments drivers use to hide their drugs surely inspired by James Bond cars.  None of them seem to reveal if they loved or hated the work or why they refused to disappear once they had a few million.
B00DI2NTK0,Christopher R. Williams,5,Futurama is great and the past couple seasons have amazed me in more ways than one. i love the normal humor but the way they work in scientific ideas into the plot and illustrate some very complex ideas about quantum physics and do it well. very cooli hope they uncancelled again but if the last episode they gave us was the real last episode it was done well.bravo
B00DI2NTK0,David Asensio,5,i love futurama i can't believe they are canceling it after this season is over what's wrong with you people this show is great it makes me laugh so hard sometimes i am so going to miss it
B00DI2NTK0,Victoria Gates "Victoria",5,I have watched Futurama for years and I absolutely love this show. It's funny without the obnoxious extremes that similar shows like Family Guy have gone into lately. Season 10 is great in my opinion.
B00DIX2KFO,Bluefishlover,5,Fantastic and thought provoking.  Can we make it a requirement for the US Congress to watch and write a summary of the message it is communicating?
B00DIX2KFO,Kansas,4,I like documentaries and this one gives a good insight on how human behavior is shaped and why we act the way we do.
B00DIX3FIK,1farstar,1,I can't believe Elijah lent himself to this trash.  If acting is looking wide-eyed during the entire movie then all the "actors" did their job.
B00DIX3FIK,cozzetta,3,Weirdly interesting
B00DIX3FIK,Route66Review,5,It has everything and then some for a great horror movie.  A must see. My dogs love horror movies as much as I do and they barked two thumbs up for this movie twice. I have to agree with my girls.
B00DIXFXHQ,charity,5,Coming into this show I expected it to be bad. Now in the third season I'm loving it. Waiting for new episodes is very difficult. Elijah Wood is awesome and Jason Gann is hilarious. I suggest this to anyone who likes a good laugh.
B00DIXFXHQ,Christopher R. Williams,5,I'm not sure if i am going insane or this show is just that good :-) loli love this show Frodo definitely does a good job. i have seen the original Australian version but this one is by far better. has all the questions of lost but none of the suicidal feelings when you find out what the answers were and just feel betrayed by the writes :-) lol
B00DIXFXHQ,Jeff,4,This show and this season are both excellent. This show is very creative and ponders the question of insanity. If you like the first two seasons get this one
B00DKRXM7S,Amazon Customer,1,Why in the world was this show produced? It's horrible. I couldn't force myself to finish. Ugh. Such a complete waste of time.
B00DKRXM7S,Amy M. Peterson,5,This is so silly yet so funny. Sometimes it just catches me and I cry from laughing. The guest appearances are great too!
B00DKRXM7S,Barbara Watson,2,Moronic idea for a series.  How they were able to get anyone to pay for such a series is beyond me.
B00DKRXM7S,Cami=) "Cami=)",4,This show is super funny and entertaining! So unless you are a history snob or drunk people bother you I Think There Is a Big Chance You Will Enjoy it!
B00DKRXM7S,ilikebooks,5,This is so funny and I love the appearances by all the actors!  It is pretty historically accurate too.  I'm so glad this series is available on prime.  I'm hoping there are more seasons coming up!
B00DKRXM7S,jonny irish,5,I suggest a case of Miller light King cans and perhaps a big fat Doobie and it's even more funny when you're just as inebriated as the idiot talking on the screen there almost all lightweights who don't do any serious drinking and this show is funny sober for about 30 min. get blasted and tune in Johnny Irish
B00DKRXM7S,Karen Wilson,5,Absolutely hilarious!  Laugh out loud funny and a wild idea for a TV show.  I hope we see more shows soon.
B00DKRXM7S,Keith E. Barber,2,Little reason to waste time on this bit of supposed comedy with all of the participants drunk at the time of their performances. Just a reminder of how unpleasant and boring drunks can be.
B00DKRXM7S,Kman,1,Hoping for laughs and learning - not my style of humor and learning too little for time invested. Some younger may like it.
B00DKRXM7S,Lorri Robinson,5,This is possibly the funniest stuff on the small screen.  I would love to watch more.  Drunk history is a great thing.
B00DKRXM7S,Pam S.,4,Like history but LOVE to watch extremely inebriated people yack......and then they yack? Man-oh-man is this ever the show for you!
B00DKRXM7S,pd,1,Intellectually and entertainingly void of any value. Kind of like a high school home movie that went viral.  Drunks gone wild.
B00DKRXM7S,Sydney Domville,5,Drunk history is precisely what I look for at parties: drunken adults trying to explain something.  And it is great.
B00DKRXM7S,Uncle B,5,So glad I have Amazon Prime so I can watch this show. Missed it  when it aired on TV and was luck to find it on Prime. One of my favorite new shows now. Can't wait for the next season!!
B00DKSAIJM,Agnieszka Koszowska "MovieLOVER",5,I can't wait for the next season ..I hope they didn't cancel it! As it's the only show similar to Desperate Housewives (but lil more funny)
B00DKSAIJM,Amazon Customer,5,this is a delightful show.. since I served as housekeeper and 'maid' they have a lot more latitude to deal w the ppl than I did.. I just saw &#34;the Butler' on tv  and that's how it had to be.. I took about a week of  being 'wallpaper' then bailed.. but the girls are the powerful ones.. brava!!!
B00DKSAIJM,CocoBees_Teaches,5,So addicted
B00DKSAIJM,Le Magicien.,5,Love this show! Would deff recommend it. Very interesting and fun to watch!!!!!!!!!! One of my fav shows to watch.
B00DKSAIJM,Southerns Belle,5,Oh I am definitely hooked. I have been watching since the very first episode..I even got my mom and friends hooked on watching these fiesty maids.
B00DKX27OG,Amazon Customer,5,i have loved this show from the first time i watched it. others will love the cool courtroom diva Brooke Elliott is a diva in this awesome show. but if you are going to watch this show and have not seen the other four seasons watch them first then watch this season.
B00DKX27OG,Amazon Customer "Reading mistress",5,Great series.  Enjoy all the characters and stories.  Loving Margaret Cho and especially how the keep Jane just the way she Iis.
B00DKX27OG,Angela,5,I watch very few shows on a regular basis.  This has become my favorite.  I found that I was upset with and/or for some of the characters in their various situations.  At times the character of Jane would get on my nerves but she always seemed to redeem herself.  It's like cheering because you feel like you know the characters and want them to be happy.  I really hope this show does not end with season 6 as the LifeTime Channel website says.  I very strongly dislike the Lifetime channel and I really think this is one of the few things they have going for them.
B00DKX27OG,CocoBees_Teaches,3,Last season got....well....slow. Hope this one picks up. It was a little slow and somewhat predictable. I still love the show
B00DKX27OG,Day Fan,5,I enjoy watching this series and can only hope the lovers get together.
B00DKX27OG,Elizabeth Bailey,5,It's as intriguing and interesting as the 1st season.  Lots of twists and turns.  Unexpected endings.  Each episode keeps my attention.
B00DKX27OG,Ellen H. Center,4,fun girlie show .  It takes me away from me and my troubles for a little while and that is good
B00DKX27OG,Mark Hall,5,We love the show Drop Dead Diva.  We had no cable service where we were located and was not interested in a satellite. Amazon Prime had the available season episodes...Never had to miss an episode.
B00DKX27OG,Marta Betts "Marta Betts",5,I found series 1-3 while looking for a fun show to stream. Not many good current programming on mainstream cable/satellite. I like to choose the shows I pay for rather than pay high prices for bad programming forces on me and paying for reruns and breaks I don't watch. I use Roku.
B00DKX27OG,Mumstheword,3,This series has fallen off a lot. It's disappointing and the story line is unconvincing - Owen coming to work at the firm for instance. I just don't buy it. It also feels as if they have run out of stories and everyone seems a bit tired with what they're doing. It's ok but it's not up to the same level as previous series.
B00DKX27OG,Newbee,5,So far we are excited to see the next season and how Grayson is going to be in on the secret!
B00DKX27OG,Runs with Scissors,3,I find it interesting that in this show they go from arrest to arraignment to trial all in the course of an afternoon.  I agree it is supposed to be lighthearted comedy but a little believability on some part of the show would be a refreshing change.
B00DKX27OG,Southerns Belle,5,I love this show. All the actors are amazing. I love love love this show.. Season 5 was very great!!
B00DLDM8HG,Marie Silverman "nysefox",5,Wow! An international crime thriller series produced in the U.S. How did that happen. This is an outstanding series. Highly recommend.
B00DLDM8HG,MWOO,4,The Crossing of borders is a very good story line.  The special division consistingof several nationalities that work together is what is intriguing.
B00DM0UX2A,Amazon Customer,2,This is a silly movie featurette. These girls must have had a good time being paid for little acting and mostly skin exposure.
B00DM0UX2A,Capt'n Bub "seau2007",1,not interested.
B00DM0UX2A,Greg,3,The movie was not something I would watch again. It was one of those movies that was LOW budget and kind of left a &#34;dirty taste in your mouth&#34; after watching it. Sorry.
B00DM0UX2A,melinda,1,I didn't watch this it lost my interest the first few minutes of it.
B00DM0UX2A,nancy,1,Bad. Did not watch past first ten minutes.
B00DM0UX2A,Patricia Appelquist,3,can you imagine the life of a teenager or young adult. money kinda rules their world..who knew? I thought it was okay and maybe I will watch the whole movie...maybe
B00DM0UX2A,TheRaven,4,That was sweet!!  Always love to see young girls scantilly clad.  The storyline was ok but the real treat was Vanessa Hudgens nearly naked!!
B00DMLRI0O,Michael "beergut",1,10 mins = nothing20 mins = nothing30 mins = yawn... what time is it?40 mins = nothing45 mins = oh- wait a minute... is something happening!?!47 mins = nope  :(55 mins = left the movie running while taking a bathroom break.65 mins = mind actually started drifting off thinking about my morning commute to work.75 mins = I give up.skip it- you won't regret it!
B00DMXS1E4,Christopher R. Williams,3,lets be honest its effing weird. but its interesting. talk about some tough survival. i mean when you get past the gigling of the fact they are naked you realize them being naked is a lot more extra challenge then it is extra attention. pretty hard core staying a month in the wild naked.Let me know when the uncensored hits :-) lol
B00DMXS1E4,Thomas Waring,1,I was very disappointed with the show and the plot. I am sorry I purchased it. Learned my lesson about buying a full season and not knowing what the show is about.
B00DMY24A0,Amazon Customer,5,Love this show!!!  The chemistry of the characters is good and the emotion is realistic and intense.  It is Very entertaining!!
B00DMY24A0,amrbilly,5,what a show I love all the cast of Rizzoli & isles...they deserved award for good action and writer as well. I never get bored with that show...
B00DMY24A0,brenda "open door",5,Watch this show every week and become part of the Rizzoli and Isle family.  They are interesting intelligent and charming. The stories are  well written.  It's all I'm looking for.
B00DMY24A0,carrie,5,THANK YOU PERFECT TEAM HATE HOW KID ENDED HIS LIFEMY PRAYERS WITH HIS FAMILY AND ALL THAT EVER GET TO THAT POINT
B00DMY24A0,cat lady 4 "Bumber's Mom",4,I like this series and enjoy the interactions of the characters.  I read one of the novels after the first season on TV.  Quite a difference in the characters.  Angie Harmon is fun to watch.  I still think NCIS would have been better if Sasha Alexander had stayed on and her character had not been killed.  I really like the supporting cast in this show.
B00DMY24A0,Douglas Deicke,5,Rizzoli and Isles had another great season last summer with season 4. Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander were always terrific together with their friendship.
B00DMY24A0,Ebele Oraghalum,5,Keep it coming....when is the next season coming up? Moreover the episodes per season are too short. Should we expect more episodes for season 5?
B00DMY24A0,Ellen H. Center,5,This is a wonderfully written show and it does not talk down to women.  Brava!!!!!!  It is dramatic and funny and everything a good television show should be
B00DMY24A0,Evelyn,5,This cast of characters is great - normal human beings - with great humor and wonderful problem solving.  The action is interesting and the personal problems portrayed by the actors are just like real everyday life.
B00DMY24A0,George R. Park,5,I have loved this show since the first season.  The leading ladies are great and the story line is easy to follow.  I like that the story is continuing and builds on prior episodes rather than separate unconnected stories.
B00DMY24A0,JJ,5,This is the fourth season of a good down to earth police show!  The morgue is not to gruesome!  I would call this o.k. for people above 13 years of age.
B00DMY24A0,mgp,3,Have loved the characters and most of the writing but the depths gone to of violence and evil are unwatchable.
B00DMY24A0,Patricia M. Brown,5,Love this show from the very begining. I like watching cop shows anyway but Rizzoli & Isles Is a perfect one with strong female leads. This show also gives you a look at them personally and how much their their differences make them closer. Best friends even though they are completely different in so many ways. Lots of Drama and Action too.
B00DMY24A0,Patricia Wollweber,5,I didn't start watching it until the 2nd season andnow I can't get enough of it.  Just love both Jane and Morrah.  Now we have bought ever season streaming.  Hope it goes for years.
B00DMY24A0,Seth C. Howard "pops",5,a near chick flick with two BEAUTIFUL ladies and good actresses . fun to watch and so on and so forth
B00DMY24A0,T. Brady "Tom",5,I have watched this show since season 1.  Both characters along with the rest of the cast are excellent.  Absolutely no exceptions.  This show is so well put together I cannot stop getting enough of it.  I recommend it HIGHLY to anyone who is out just exploring it.  I have all four seasons and love them all.
B00DMY24A0,The1and0nly,2,Was really looking forward too another show that could fulfill my dream of being as good as the wire. Sadly this doesn't. While there is lots of action and the grenade that was thrown from a foot ball field was cool I thought there was way too much emphasis on the cats that shoot spiderwebs. Well nice try but just not the wire-worthy
B00DN15JWW,brenda "open door",5,I really like this show.  I held my breath waiting to see if it would be renewed last season.  I am enjoying it as much this season as I did last.  It is intelligent and well written.  The characters are for the most part likable  and the ones we don't like we're not meant to.
B00DN15JWW,David Lehmann,5,Bit of a stretch on reality but good to consider giving special people opportunity and respect for them to use their special talents.  My impression is this does not often happen in real life. Worth the time and thought provoking.
B00DN15JWW,Debbie Dillon,5,a very good show. The cast of characters are great and I think that the scripts are very well written
B00DN15JWW,Ebele Oraghalum,5,Keep it coming....when is the next season coming up? Moreover the episodes per season are too short. Should we expect more episodes for season 3?
B00DN15JWW,flygirltaylor,5,I fly quite often and I only allow myself to watch Perception while I am flying.  It is something that I look forward to and it really makes those long plane rides tolerable.  LOVE this show and am hooked.
B00DN15JWW,Genavee,5,I enjoy how this shows uses Eric illness to show that people has to be aware as to how the medication and situations can affect them. This show is such a great role model in showing how to can make choices of their own. Everyone is really good in their roles ! Keep of the great work.
B00DN15JWW,Haven Healer,5,I reviewed Season 1 -- and the good keeps going with Season 2 !
B00DN15JWW,JJ,4,This story is not for anyone under the age of 18.  This is just like the Russell Crowe movie A Beautiful Mind.  You have got to stay on track as people appear out of thin air and will make you wonder what is happening!  Stay on your toes or you will miss the whole plot and the ending will be difficult to follow!  All of the characters in this show are believable.
B00DN15JWW,Joyce Gilliland,4,this is an interesting twist to crime fighting and the use of a professional's mental illness. makes you wonder if this could be true in real life.
B00DN15JWW,Lora Condon "Lora Condon",5,Best and most intriguing show I've seen in a very long time.
B00DN15JWW,Paula Jankowski,5,Do not miss the show and am never disappointedI Like that the girl is getting back with her ex
B00DN15JWW,pkinglib,5,I have watched this show from the beginning and I love it!! Eric McCormick does a fantastic job as Dr. Pierce!! Loved him in &#34;Will and Grace&#34;!! He is an amazing actor!!
B00DN15JWW,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,5,Series like this I find educational as well as being entertaining.  I have not found one episode to be boring.  The ideas are interestingly worked out each week in a mere 43 minutes.
B00DN7LSXU,beth holman,2,Not that great of film I expected a good love story but none there.  Don't waste your money.could of been better.
B00DN7LSXU,Book Lover "Black Book Lover",3,This was a very trpical Tyler Perry movie. I always go into his movies not expecting alot and this didn't dissapoint. I am giving it three stars because while it wasn't anything special at least it deals with the issue of fidelty from an African American perspective and that is rarely seen in the movies.
B00DN7LSXU,Ellie,4,I thought the movie was very good.  The acting was great and the story kept your interest to the very end.
B00DN7LSXU,htmcs,3,This was a difficult movie to watch. I knew that the guy was the  the x husband from the time he came into the drug store and freaked her out. Would not watch again.
B00DN7LSXU,Le Magicien.,1,The title is the only thing tempting about this boring movie. Don't waste your money. I was so disappointed ugh.
B00DN7LSXU,Southerns Belle,2,I really don't think this was some of his best work. I am more of a Madea lover. Would rather laugh than be confused
B00DN7LSXU,Tabitha,5,It was a great movie and it OPENS certain people's eyes to things. The almost ending is just mind blowing!
B00DN7LSXU,troutpaws "troutpaws",2,I saw the 4 star rating. story was good but the acting from the main character was terrible.I really wanted to like this movie but could not tolerate affected acting.
B00DNTW8W8,Brenda Santiago,5,so much going on this season... cant believe the intensity of the players this season!!!I think it better than all other seasons...
B00DNUF7KW,catthief,3,I love science fiction.  There aren't enough good movies out there.  This one was pretty good and didn't make me feel like it was made for kids.
B00DNUF7KW,crosscountryman,3,The technoclogical aspects of this trip to Europa given our present level of expertise seems precise and accurate.  I would hope that the viewer has no expectations of how this adventure ends!  There is an unexpected ending!
B00DNUF7KW,Dentish,1,Utterly devoid of entertainment value. Makes you long for the old end-of-day test pattern.
B00DNUF7KW,Lawrence Tuczynski "godzillamusic",3,The trailer for this movie shows the best parts. While the movie isn't bad it never lives up to it's potential. Very little action and slow moving. This could have been a great movie with a little tweaking. You certainly won't confuse this with &#34;Prometheus&#34; or any of the &#34;Alien&#34; movies.
B00DNUF7KW,M. Surber,3,Well...all that (SPOILER ALERT)For an Alien SquidWow...kind of a big let down...and the rental cost was WAYYYYY too much for this garbage.
B00DNUF7KW,NY rat "+",5,I like my space movies. Especially when they make new ones. This one was suspenseful enough to keep me occupied. Worth a watch. Was believable.
B00DNUF7KW,Tab,5,EUROPA RESPOT IS SOMETHING I AN NOT SO SURE ABOUT WHEN I SAW IT.  I AM SO GLAD I GOT IT. IT IS VERY ENTERTAINING.
B00DOS59RE,bernie "xyzzy",4,Joey (Jason Statham) an ex-Special Forces officer who could not handle it any more goes homeless and drinks to dull the killing machine he was turned into. One day his girlfriend is abducted and pressed into servicing.He has the opportunity to become the man he was for the summer. With the help of a soup-kitchen num Cristina (Agata Buzek) that has issues of her own he plans to track down and dispatch a bad guy.The unique side to this movie is not the formula but the execution. We also have the Joe and Cristina is not the driven snow type themselves.
B00DOS59RE,Danny L. Abernathy,4,the best get better and the movie is very better HA!HA!HA!what a mouthfulis this best Jason can ever dothe powers that be is this industry should try him in another genre
B00DOS59RE,helena,4,I watched this movie last night. It was a good movie...filmed in London. I liked it. But I think his other movies were more action packed than this one. I am looking forward to his NEW movie called "Homefront". Cant wait to see it!
B00DOS59RE,inspectorudy,4,This is a story of a man who suffers from PTSD after a tour in the far East. He has some devils in his head and has become a homeless street bum trying to escape them. He is befriended by a young nun and eventually pulls himself up out of the gutter to extract revenge on some who have killed his best friend. The movie has some of Statham's routine martial arts antics but you will sheer when employs them. This is a movie that will make you root for the flawed man and hope that he wins in the end. You will be surprised and see a role that you do not expect.
B00DOS59RE,Jane,3,Just another one of a thousand other similar movies... tough lug who has a good side gets himself into a jam then out again.  Harmless entertainment...
B00DOS59RE,seetheartsoftly,5,Jason Statham great actor especially on action movie  nice and clear .great dvd  love the movie redemption is drama/action/thriller all in one
B00DOS59RE,Vicki Butcher,2,Long and drawn out! Worst Jason Statham movie to date. Just didn't seem to go anywhere. One of those movies  you keep watching hoping something is going to happen...It doesn't
B00DPU3C5M,Happy Time,3,I enjoyed it but would have liked to see more of their time in Scandinavia in the earlier years.  Would have enjoyed more info on the origins of their religious beliefs.
B00DPU3C5M,Robert Habeski,1,This movie was dull and uninteresting .  It had very little information about the life of Norsemen.  The story was disjointed and dull. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00DQ4N5T0,Jack,3,The announcer is a little annoying. I feel like I'm watching an hour long commercial. and the facts are sensationalized and exaggerated.
B00DQ4N5T0,Stella LaRue "kellygirl",3,As someone who loves history I enjoy a lot of aspects of this show.  Its filled with historical tidbits and interesting locations.  During the episodes there are frequent references to ghost (people who have seen paranormal things are interviewed) and they talk about how the history of a place could create a ghostly disturbance - but it never really rises to a real &#34;ghost show.  And it really isn't a history show.  Being something indistinct and in between - the entire series is less than it could be.
B00DQISQX6,aloha1127,5,Season 3 was easily far better than season 2 and back on track. The stories made sense and we are left with an easy transition to season 4.Hopefully the writers don't get too clever that they mess things up like they did in season 2.
B00DQISQX6,Amazon Customer,4,Lots to twists as the &#34;:firm&#34; goes through many changes.  Very interesting personalities.  You feel like you are a fly on the wall seeing the inner workings of a big firm of lawyers.
B00DQISQX6,amrbilly,5,I love the drama and mystery show you never know what going to happen. I don't mind the big EGO but I never get tired of it and I cant wait what happening next!!!!it worth to watch it!!!
B00DQISQX6,Ann M. Hoffman,5,Watched all 2014 series already. Once u get into u can't stop watching. Take my word for it. U will enjoy
B00DQISQX6,Anon "Anon",5,I love Suits... I cannot say anything bad and any time I can spend staring at Harvey is a good time!
B00DQISQX6,Antonia or Len Fishler,5,Continuation of the excellent character driven series. They keep ratcheting up the conflict and stakes. Humorous counterpoint adds to the enjoyment.
B00DQISQX6,Barbara,5,The actors on the show are very talented in presenting such complicated legal arguments and pursuing them in court.  They also portray their personal life with style.  People can feel the problems with their relationships.
B00DQISQX6,Beverly Johnson,5,Love it. Season 3 was a good progression of characters and storyline. Can't wait to start Season 4.
B00DQISQX6,Carlos A. Hermida "Carlos",5,Excellent series. A must see.
B00DQISQX6,christel,5,IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER.  LOVE THE WRITING AND INTRIGUING PLOTLINES.  NOW THE BRITISH CONTINGENT ADDS MORE LAYERS AND POSSIBILITIES.
B00DQISQX6,Cooper,5,I love the smart and witty writing. Perfect casting.  My husband and I can hardly wait for the next episode.
B00DQISQX6,Craig Miller,4,Enjoy the cast and how they relate to one another in the script.. Keep up the good work this next season..
B00DQISQX6,Cynthia,4,The chemistry between the main characters (all six) is incredible. They play off each other so easily and make it feel real. We are very glad that season 4 starts in 2 weeks!
B00DQISQX6,cynthia,5,This show comically addresses the cutthroat world of  corporate legal America.  It often gives pause for consideration as we see politics at work in our daily jobs and in the news.
B00DQISQX6,D. Ernstzen "DE",5,I just love the interaction between these lawyers. It might not be representative of the real world but the portrayal on television is just fantastic. You can feel the tension and the mechanizations are so interesting to watch. You can almost see the cogs working in their heads trying to figure out how to save their client.I guess that is what makes for great television. Well worth it and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00DQISQX6,Diane Sanford,2,TOO MUCH CURSING AND PUT DOWN OF CHARACTERS.
B00DQISQX6,D. Light,4,The leads are very good. This season is showing more depth in Gabriel Macht's character. The plot twists are exciting.
B00DQISQX6,DMT,5,What a great series.  I cannot wait until season 4 comes.  I wait impatiently what a great cast of actors
B00DQISQX6,Elizabeth Ansley,5,Im addicted to this series but I fear the writers will run the course on interesting material but the actors are eye candy and the women wear great clothing
B00DQISQX6,Fast Freddy "Fred",5,This series continues to get better and better.  The writing is always great and the performances are there to match.
B00DQISQX6,fredd,4,A good suspense thriller. This show will captivate you and make you try to watch as many as you can.
B00DQISQX6,gary blakely,5,intriguing ...entertaining ...great story lines....lawyers ..... maybe not a lawyer....deals no deals ...negotiate.....twisted  ....legal shady...NO deals.....and finally one very important word.....DONNA
B00DQISQX6,Jacklyn Ostler,5,My husband and I have seen all 3 seasons of Suits. The show is really entertaining and great to watch. We can't wait for the start of Season 4!
B00DQISQX6,Jan Funk,5,Wonderfully sophisticated and true to life show with a GREAT ensemble. Could watch it everyday. So sorry it is gone.
B00DQISQX6,Jean White,5,I have purchased Seasons 1 and 2. I am impressed with all the characters in this TV show! I will be a life long fan of this series! I will purchase every episode for Season 3.
B00DQISQX6,Joan,5,Season 3 continues where the last season left off.  Characters are great and I highly recommend you watch this show.
B00DQISQX6,John Crites,5,we have enjoyed all three seasons and are caught up to the current season of suits
B00DQISQX6,Kelley Kuhlman "paperglyphs",4,This is a great program. I am not even a &#34;drama&#34; person and I love it. The relationships continue to develop and the story doesn't lag. Character development is splendid  - they just get more and more interesting. I hope they can keep it up and not destroy them for ratings.
B00DQISQX6,Kerlyn,5,The story lines get better and better. They keep building on the drama and  the Law Firm and the back stories of the characters  but still want more around Lous and Jessica.... worth every minute of watching it.
B00DQISQX6,KK,5,Fun show. Nice alternative look at lawyers that's not realistic but lighter and less serious than other law shows. First two seasons on netflix instant
B00DQISQX6,Kobe 519 "Genevieve Cherry-Sours",4,I'm not much of an attorney show type person but I am in love with this show. It's not predictable.
B00DQISQX6,K. Thomas,5,Great Show. It is a struggle to keep the momentum going. Not sure all the new people (Scotty) is the way to go. But I will keep watching.
B00DQISQX6,Lane,4,Love the interaction between characters--didn't like when they were acting apart.  The Harvard cover-up is getting a bit old--Mike needs to get legit!  Gabriel needs a true love interest.
B00DQISQX6,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",4,The only problem with Season 3 is there weren't enough sequences.  I would have liked to have seen several more.  I am looking forward to Season 4.  I hope the writing is a little better.
B00DQISQX6,Lauren,4,I like the play between characters in this show.  Lots of interesting story lines etc.  A great show to watch!
B00DQISQX6,L. Carson "L Carson",5,This season proved to have more complications and sit on the edge of your seat action.  Really got into it this season!
B00DQISQX6,Linda K. Holman,5,My Mom and I watch this together.  We both like it.  Good for all ages.
B00DQISQX6,Lizs Home Made,5,I have enjoyed this season. It was full of surprises. I can not wait to see what happens next season.
B00DQISQX6,loyce "Media Maven",5,Writing is great; actors are appealing and charismatic and the characters are interesting and colorful; and I enjoy how the characters play off one another especially Louisl.
B00DQISQX6,Maekar,5,They really did a good job with this show.  If you didn't know who made it you would think it was a premium channel series.
B00DQISQX6,MargyL "MargyL",5,I highly recommend this one.  Not at all a &#34;typical&#34; lawyer show. The writing keeps you intrigued and the acting is great!
B00DQISQX6,MaryAnn,5,This is the type of show I enjoy watching.  You never knowwhat is going to happen next.  The clothes designer knewhow to show all of the actors to their best advantage.Romance and lots of problems.  All of the actors wereterrific.  Can't pick a favorite but I have to say that&#34;Louis&#34; played it to the hilt.  So many little&#34;quirks&#34; that only he could do.  Wish there was more.
B00DQISQX6,MaryBee,4,Smart writing and good acting = a great series. Suits Season 3 keeps rolling along with the same winning combination!
B00DQISQX6,Melanie,5,Love this show.  It's been a real addiction.  We can hardly wait for the next episode.  The buildup of the plots and characters is superb and the cinematography is unparalleled.
B00DQISQX6,Mumstheword,4,It's not as good as Season 1 or 2. But it's still well written and acted. The story line just isn't as smart as before. But still you can count on quality TV programming.
B00DQISQX6,Patois,3,I enjoyed the previous seasons more.  The continuing saga of the Hesington Oil trial - twists and turns- trying to keep up got a little tedious.  Three episodes -beginning - middle - end would have been enough.  I was also glad Mike took another job.  It was beginning to be a little dubious - how long was he going to practice law without a license!
B00DQISQX6,Patricia Appelquist,4,Some of the repetitive story lines are just ..repetitive I guess life is really boring and yeah everyone is going to know Mike's secret in 1.2.3 seasons (sic) I only watch it now for the fashion solely because it will be this show to tell us when the peplum leapord print phase is OVER
B00DQISQX6,Patricia Doherty,5,Top two characters  have witty banter but wit is not limited to them.  Whole cast of clever characters  is well acted.
B00DQISQX6,pops95b,5,This has been a great show. I am always on the edge of my seat to see what happens next. Although Mike can act like a petulant child at times it is a great chemistry between all the characters and Donna is so kick-ass i am always dying to see what she will say and do next!
B00DQISQX6,Popular1,5,This show and episode had me on the edge of my seat. Thank You writers for doing an excellent job of making this seam soooo real and entertaining. PLZ keep up the good work. I look forward to summer.
B00DQISQX6,Prefl96,5,This is a really good show. Each season gets better and the story line holds you attention. Hope Amazon continues to offer future episodes of this show for free with Prime.
B00DQISQX6,Raymond J. Brunner,4,I love watching this show. It is very well written with a good story line. Fun  to watch with a plot.
B00DQISQX6,ReviewersEars,5,What's not to love?  Hot guys who have man-crushes on each other and have brains to match their pretty faces.
B00DQISQX6,R. H. Newmark "BobN",5,If you liked Boston Legal you will absolutely like this show. The characters are well developed and the plot from week to week is interesting however sometimes I don't get some of the slang.
B00DQISQX6,Ruth@the movies,5,One of the best Lawyer shows ever! Everyone should watch Suits! Can't wait for the next season to be available.
B00DQISQX6,S. Grady,5,Have enjoyed watching and find that the plots are much more plausible than many shows on TV today. The characters are all interesting and the various plot lines are interwoven expertly!
B00DQISQX6,Sissy Kirsteen,5,I love Suits!  Harvey Specter and Mike have such an interesting relationship and it has been fascinating to watch the characters grow &#8211; it seems that Harvey has grown as a person whilst mentoring Mike and Mike has grown in respect and loyalty towards Harvey.  They are a fabulous team.I wish the authors could work out how Mike could become legal!One can&#8217;t help but feel for Louis (he is so needy but also brilliant) but I would not like to get on the wrong side of him!  It was so sweet to see him in love &#8211; sad that it did not work out.Rachel is wonderful &#8211; a really important part of the Series.  She is absolutely unique and so likable &#8211; and funny.Jessica still needs to open up a bit; we don&#8217;t really know her but have had a glimpse here and there of a strong and kind woman.Donna is lovely and has really found her niche in the firm.  She is just right for Mike and I appreciate the strength of their relationship.All in all the humor and wit in the dialogue make this a very enjoyable piece of entertainment.
B00DQISQX6,Southern belle "southern belle",3,Cursing doesn't bother me; what bothers me is when it is done so gratuitously as in this show.  Say it when necessary; don't overuse it or it loses its impact.  Story is good as is the acting.
B00DQISQX6,Spencer Nassau,5,My favorite season by far. There is so much more depth to everyone and the backstory for each character is incredible.
B00DQISQX6,Stray Matter Inc.,5,Liked the series - Well done series with creative characters and interesting story line - Believable and entertaining - worth watching
B00DQISQX6,Sue Boyle "blue9244",5,I can hardly wait until next season!  I love the premise and the actors are doing a wonderful job with their characters.  I especially like Rachel and Donna!  Keep these fine dramas coming!
B00DQISQX6,Susan Crow,5,This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite shows.  It holds my attention from beginning to end and always leaves me wanting more.  I am not so patiently waiting for Season 4 to start.
B00DQISQX6,Tammie Hurst,5,As I have said about other series I love this series I only began watching this season so I bought one and two also and love it even more.  Hopefully it will be around for many years to come.
B00DQISQX6,Tanya Opoulos,5,Cannot wait for the next season to begin. Another 'must watch'. I watched this also on Netflix-- Episode after episode. Love Harvey and Mike and the gang!
B00DQISQX6,taylor,5,A brilliant young man with a fake law degree in the world of hot litigation is a new twist on courtroom programs. I look forward to season 4.
B00DQISQX6,techie mike,5,I love this show so much that I would watch it every night if it were possible. truly brilliant plots.
B00DQISQX6,TKD Fan,5,This is a great show!  A must watch for everyone.  Always keeps you on the edge for the next twist!
B00DQISQX6,zzdb,5,In 3 seasons it hasnt lost its charm. I really like the character development and where they have gone with the show
B00DR98H4C,Marian Becker,1,This movie tries too hard to be smart and witty but instead is just boring.  The rambling dialog of the man's best friend is especially irritating. The actors are supposed to be wildly in love with each other but never seem to pull off the illusion.  With such a great cast I thought this movie would be a good choice.  I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or $10 like I did.
B00DR98H4C,NY rat "+",3,My favorite scenes were when they were meeting with a lawyer? to write up their wishes in the event of vegetative situation and also when he showed up for their anniversary dinner and asked for divorce. Overall may be an ok time waster if there's nothing else to watch.
B00DSXI5BW,Andrew Baker,5,Lost Girl Rocks! One of the best series ever! We love this program! 9 out of 10 stars! Yay! Yay! Yay!
B00DSXI5BW,Gerald Harris,4,I'm sure that the person who received this dvd was as impressed as I was.i really can't say for sure cause it was a gift for my daughter in maine and I haven't heard from her yet
B00DSXI5BW,Isabeau,5,Wasn't sure I would like this series but I quite enjoy.  It's off the beaten path of what a lot of supernatural series are about these days so this was a totally unexpected and pleasant spin on the supernatural.  Very steamy.
B00DSXI5BW,lremick,5,This is  another series I like and will watch again and again. I only purchase the series that I like so that I can watch them any time. Action and battles make the series a must watch.
B00DSXI5BW,rg,5,They haven't had the reason to take it off the air. Like they did with another of my favorites. I really enjoy the fantasy world this takes me to. And doesn't drop me off.
B00DSXI5BW,thecoolcard,5,season 3 was very good I like them all season 1 2 and 3 and I will get season 4 asap !!!
B00DTOYIIE,Adam Richards "that dude",4,not my favorite season of BB but stil an awesome closeout to this epic series. I guess a reason it wasn't as entertaining because the story development had more or less stopped and you witnessed the last Chapter of the Walter White story. Still it was great and the finale was far better than many show finale's....now i've got nothing left to do but start from episode again
B00DTOYIIE,Amazon Customer,5,If you haven't seen Breaking Bad and want to start a series that is definitely entertaining this is the penultimate.  Breaking Bad is your opportunity to see the best TV series ever!
B00DTOYIIE,AmazonFan,5,First of all I want to say THANK YOU to amazon.com for carrying Breaking Bad!!!!!  I don't have TV and never will...and I'm busy so I do everything on the computer on my time...and I'm sooooo happy amazon.com has the Final---or season 6 whatever it's called doesn't matter....Just a quick shout out to amazon--Thanks for making it streaming!
B00DTOYIIE,Amy M. Peterson,5,Breaking Bad is the best television I have seen since the Sopranos. It is so well acted and so well written. I absolutely loved watching this show.
B00DTOYIIE,Anthony P. Olson,5,What needs to be said?  A perfect ending to one of the greatest shows on television.  The final episode is stunningly great.
B00DTOYIIE,Arturo Del Campillo Reyes,5,Bryan Cranston delivers an ending worthy of an Oscar if this was a movie lol. The ending was just amazing well written great acted well executed a must see.
B00DTOYIIE,Bacon,5,Wow. This is the best show I have ever watched. The ending was even fantastic which is hard to find these days with series. Watch this and you will not be disappointed.
B00DTOYIIE,Barbara Watson,5,This show had my husband mesmerized and found ourselves arranging our schedule around it.  We were lost without it for awhile when it ended.  We watched the final episode 3 times.
B00DTOYIIE,Boulder Mike,4,BB is a classic by now. I kind of miss the first season..absolutely stunning back then in many ways. The rest of the season where somnewhat predictable and repetitive. Still give it 4 stars..
B00DTOYIIE,Brabass,5,This whole series was suspenseful and exciting from start to finish and will go down as one of the best television series of all time. It is a must watch!
B00DTOYIIE,C. C. Faulkner "gaelicvideo",5,One of the best ending for any show I have followed over the years. I loved the use of lasers during the last show.
B00DTOYIIE,Christine Poortenga,5,I chose this rating because there wasn't a ten star option. Is there any way to get another season?  When does the movie come out?
B00DTOYIIE,Christopher R. Williams,5,Dude dude dude dude!!!! it's freaking breaking bad. if i had to choose to wipe all other dramas from my memory and only keep one it would probably be breaking bad. seriously one of the best shows made. truly depicts the creation of evil from a white canvas. so many shows will have the bad guy that is bad just because he is bad. very few are able to show that all evil starts somewhere somehow for some reason.the path to hell is paved with good intentions and Walter White had one finely paved road.
B00DTOYIIE,CMZ Art,5,Very great series and the final season was perfect. The last episode was an especially fitting way to wrap the series!! Great job!!  Even after knowing how it ends...I'll rewatch the entire series!!
B00DTOYIIE,cpp6160,5,One of the best series I've ever watched. What do I do now that it's over? I know! I'll watch Sons. I'll miss you Walt.
B00DTOYIIE,C.S.,5,Although this was a non stop violent story I couldn't stop watching to see how it ended up.  Would recommend this series.
B00DTOYIIE,Dangerman "Dan G.",2,IMHO...Good thing this show is ending. Everything so far this season just seems cartoonish and manipulative story-wise. It's like the writers ran out of the good stuff so now there just throwing everything in there to run out the clock. Last two seasons were a lot better. This year the show's isn't grounded or compelling. I think people are watching just to see what wacky improbable plot point is going to pop out and shock us next. And really...did they have to revisit the ricin cigarette yet again? Enough with that nonsense!
B00DTOYIIE,Deacon Blue,5,It just keeps getting better and more surprising! Can't wait to see what happens next. I will miss this show when it's over.
B00DTOYIIE,Deborah J. Towns,5,my hometown Detroit I love this show!! i love that people get to see what this city looks like now and hope someone with half a brain can save her! but that's not the only reason I love this show-great actors & great plot!!
B00DTOYIIE,Dennis "barbarosa",5,One of the finest television series of all times has finally run its course. Too bad but at least it went out well. From start to finish the final season was excellent and as expected Walt did &#34;win&#34; in the end
B00DTOYIIE,Dentish,5,Great series. Lousy ending.
B00DTOYIIE,D. Light,5,Intense. Real. Thoroughly believeable acting. Strong ending for one of the great series of all time. Rest in peace Walter White.
B00DTOYIIE,D. Tinsley,5,One of my favorite series of all time. Loved the last 3 episodes. Finally a great series with a sastisfying end
B00DTOYIIE,Edward H. Bell,5,There is very little to add to the reviews of this superb award winning series. We loved all of the seasons and this is the finish and the icing on the cake.
B00DTOYIIE,Eleanor Weber,5,I loved this series  I will miss it. This is probably the greatest acting have ever seen. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal.
B00DTOYIIE,Ellie,5,This series is the best I've seen in a long time and would highly recommend it to my family and friends.  Great acting a good story.
B00DTOYIIE,Eman,5,Now that the last episode is out we can hardly wait to see thee the fate of old Walter White. I hope Jesse gets him if anybody does.
B00DTOYIIE,Hanamaru "Hana",5,One of the best series of all time if not the best.  Storyline  and acting superb and ended when it should have.  There was nothing more to add but it leaves a gaping hole in entertainment.
B00DTOYIIE,HannahLynn,5,Best show ever. Can't imagine another series that will ever touch this show. We watched all the seasons streaming then purchased the last season because we didn't want to miss it!! Amazing!!!
B00DTOYIIE,Happy Guy,5,This show is probably the most unpredictable series I have ever watched. Totally worth all of the hype surrounding Breaking Bad
B00DTOYIIE,Helen E. Dowd "HD",5,As usual AMC does not disappoint! Off to a great start toward the ending of this show. I look forward to it every weekend.
B00DTOYIIE,Jannieknows "Jannie",5,I could go on and on about the story lines and the acting and the writing.....and everything else that was so fabulous about this show.  But I will not.  What I will do is simply challenge you to just take a look and see it for yourself.  You will be writing the same 5 star rating I am.  If there were 6 stars....I would give it a 6!
B00DTOYIIE,Jared,5,Two pills in pupils.....well maybe its not pills but Walt's back and badder than ever.  The first episodes are a little slow but I think it is a ramp up to a huge season with twists and roller coaster action.  Heisenburgs run isn't over yet.  But it won't boad well for him I think in the end.  If you get a chance to watch do IT!
B00DTOYIIE,Jeepin' rocks!,5,WOW!! It will be hard to ever find such a well written and acted series. So sad this series is over . The final episode was epic. Highly recommend this series.
B00DTOYIIE,Jeff,5,Best action/drama series of all time. This show belongs in the same catogory as the Sopranos. Anyone who waste time watching tv needs to watch this show from beginning to end. The ending is epic and everything in between.
B00DTOYIIE,JH,5,The best series I think I have ever seen. The writing and acting and story was addictive. I miss it.
B00DTOYIIE,John H. Macdonald,5,***No Spoilers Here***The last half of Season 5 Breaking Bad is almost Shakespearean in its sense of inevitable disaster as all that has gone before comes to a series of almost inevitable conclusions. Don't think you can guess the resolution of these long threads of life choices that lead to...the final conclusion.
B00DTOYIIE,Jorge,5,Now I will have to go back to just hating politicians.  &#60;sigh&#62; So limiting.  Hands down this has brought some of the best actors and  writers to TV.  For those of you who think 'The Wire' is better...all I can say is you are out of your ever-lovin' minds.  I have never enjoyed disliking so many people in all my years of watching TV.  It has been to TV drama what Seinfeld was to TV comedy.
B00DTOYIIE,Judith A. Chandler,5,What can you say this series was fabulous. Don't need to tell anyone that.  Loved it. Loved getting the download version.
B00DTOYIIE,Kathy,5,Breaking Bad is simply one of the 10 best TV series ever. It should be required &#34;reading&#34; alongside Shakespeare and the other great tragic plays.
B00DTOYIIE,kwolgast,5,I watched all of these episodes in one sitting and I couldn't stop.  I knew it had to come to an end and this show delivers a great ending.  Best show I've seen.
B00DTOYIIE,Looking for a Blockbuster,3,The show is taking off to a slow start. I expected more from the last season. Hopefully it warms up in the next few episodes.  I've seen better from this show.
B00DTOYIIE,luvsminis "mini horse lover",5,this is one of the best series i have seen in a long time. the actors were ALL very good in this series. i would reccomend it to any adult to watch. it is spell binding.
B00DTOYIIE,Lynn McBee,5,We could not quite watching!! Sometimes we wish we were irresponsible enough to have blown off work to watch without interruption. The acting was spot on. The writing was so wonderful. Not one misstep in the whole season. Another show to keep away from the kids (so many situations that would be hard to explain). Also violence and drugs.
B00DTOYIIE,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",5,This is only the best show ever! Byran Cranston and Aaron Paul are  amazing actor. I love watching together. And Walts transformation from chem teacher to meth dealer. WOW! If you're not watching this show you must live under a rock!
B00DTOYIIE,mocha teddy,5,Heisenberg rules! Bryan Cranston is a great actor. Im sad to see this series end but I cant wait to see how it does end.
B00DTOYIIE,Nick,5,there is a reason this show developed into what it has. the depth to this drama never gets stale and the story is always gripping
B00DTOYIIE,passionatereader,5,These last eight episodes were so engrossing that I wanted to own them and did.  Wasn't able to catch up with the whole showon Netflix but can go back sometime now that it is over.  I wanted to be part of the last episodes viewing public and be ableto discuss with my kids who told me I had to watch this (for years actually)because it was the best thing they'd ever seen.Read everything online after each episode and now look forward to seeing what everyone thought of this finale.I thought it was heartbreaking.  That's how it broke bad for me.
B00DTOYIIE,Reta Kerr,5,I love the way the final season has started.  So glad Walt's wife is now supporting him. Also love  the brother in laws revalation at end of last episode.
B00DTOYIIE,Richard L. Depatta,5,Need more
B00DTOYIIE,Ruth Grady,5,It was a great series and we enjoy it very much and will rewatch it over time so we are glad to have the entire series.
B00DTOYIIE,Ruth,3,The best thing about this season is that Walt finally admits that he didn't do it for the family. I watched this show because I deal with meth lab cleanups. One time exposure can create an addiction and there is a 90% failure in overcoming the addiction for those who try. Don't glorify meth production.
B00DTOYIIE,Sargentrock "I love stuff!  and this place ha...,5,Now that it's done this show ranks in my top ten of all time great shows to ever be on TV.  Where exactly I haven't decided yet (The Wire is still #1--other than that the rest are fair game).  If you haven't seen it watch it from start to finish--it's amazing and worth every minute.
B00DTOYIIE,T. Donoghue "Observer",3,Many crumbs are bring dropped but maybe the long  break has effected the show some what?  You know the infamous &#34; Sopranos&#34; effect? Everything is internal except for everyone's favorite side kick Jesse Pinkman.
B00DTOYIIE,The1and0nly,4,This is a good show don't get me wrong but anyone who thinks this is better than the wire is insane. The wire was on a different level with tv. This is great but the wire is the best show ever made ever. Also the ending too this was very blah. I think that Jessie was way better in the other seasons too.
B00DTOYIIE,TomG "CW Junkie",5,Our number one choice for early evening viewing (too violent for late night). Glad to see the show has won so many awards.
B00DTOYIIE,Tristan "Tristan",5,It's been a great series and I highly recommend anyone that's not watched it. I'm sure we'll watch all the seasons over again.
B00DTOYIIE,T's Amazon,5,Absolutely the best show around and very sad it is no longer but it went out on top with a bang and it was worth every minute!
B00DTOYIIE,Warren Johnson "Warren the Camera Guy",4,Final season does a good job of wrapping up loose ends and entertaining the user.  Best season in my opinion is season 4.  Something happened to the writing between season 4 and 5 that left the first half of season 5 wanting.  Even with the season 5 writing being a bit poor it is still really good compared to almost anything else on tv. I wouldn't hesitate to see this.
B00DTOYIIE,wc1001,5,I got into this show after the 2nd season and never looked back! It was very intense and exciting. WOW
B00DTOYIIE,Weston Gross,5,Amazon needs two reviews. One to rate the show and the other to rate the customer service. People are giving this show a bad rating because of customer service.
B00DTOYIIE,zzdb,5,Each season this show continued to impress. There are surprises and twists with each episode. The ending does a great job wrapping up the final season. I do not think you will be disappointed; unless you are looking for a foofoo love story.
B00DU6NVU2,Christopher R. Williams,5,love top gear. there is really nothing to say but there are fast unbelievable cars being driven around recklessly. stupid ideas of children are played out in well stocked and well funded garages. and i cant get enough of it. make as many shows as you can and i will purchase them all :-) lol
B00DU6NVU2,John E. Scott,5,I don't watch these guys to get reviews of everyday models of cars. I watch these guys to see the one's I will never afford to buy.They truly delve into the esoteric but then drive piles of junk across the desert in a man against nature race. If you want true reality TV then this show is what you should watch. I am a gear head for sure having worked on cars much of my life either as a hobby or professionally as a mechanic. Its very odd though that I just cannot get interested in the US version of this show. I think the personalities make a big difference in the UK original.
B00DU6NVU2,Mal,5,I love everything about his show. The guys are too hilarious. Everything they do cracks me up. Definitely recommend for a good laugh.
B00DU6NVU2,pops95b,5,One of the best shows on tv. It hasnt been on for 21 seasons for no reason!  I love the show and reccommend it to anyone.
B00DVFR8QA,D,4,It gets your attention. You really get into the strange young female detective.  We started watching it back to back and couldnt stop.  We found it very entertaining and very interesting and different.
B00DVFR8QA,D. Light,4,Both leads are quite excellent. Plots and characters are strong. The acting is superb. I would highly recommend this show.
B00DVFR8QA,Duncan Brown,5,I was so pleased this was available streaming as the show was being broadcast ( No HBO wait for Boardwalk Empire) and was caught up into the story quickly. I really like the female detective with her asburger? syndrome. I am waiting to see Ep 4. Love the show.
B00DVFR8QA,E. Saltbush,4,Whoa. Pilot has me intrigued. An honest Mexican policeman? A cop who appears to have Asperger's syndrome? Corpses cut in half.
B00DVFR8QA,John C Woods,5,I liked the characters. I thought the story was relevant and well thought out. I think the premise is very relevant.
B00DVFR8QA,john francis leonard,5,This is based on the Swedish/Danish series with a lot of fascinating new premises. The whole story of the crime and murder in Juarez. Diane Kruger is great but not nearly as good as her predecessor. The male lead is also very good but different than the character in Denmark.
B00DVFR8QA,John T Robinson,4,Quirky characters and interesting plot lines. This is the reason that network TV is failing. Can't wait for the next season.
B00DVFR8QA,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",1,I purchased the entire first season so I could compare to the original Swedish/ Danish original.  So far Amazon's Instant service is a bust!!  I can't see anything... only audio!  What gives.
B00DVFR8QA,Julie Murphy,5,this show is fun and wicked at the same time.  The actors are pretty good even though they aren't popular.  We enjoyed it.
B00DVFR8QA,MM,5,This is an exciting and good show. Lots of turns and twists and the more you watch the more you get to know.
B00DVFR8QA,mocha teddy,3,The woman detective who plays someone with autism only succeeds in being stilted and boring. Not with getting involved in series.
B00DVFR8QA,nocnotes2day,5,Entertaining drama on many levels.  Love the politics of the border and yet there are not many boundaries on these writers.  The shock value is as good as the entertainment value.  Can't wait for each week!
B00DVFR8QA,pegeen,5,This show comes at a time that perfect fits a void.  I enjoy the attention to detail and how it is unfolding each week.
B00DVFR8QA,R. A. Macgaren,5,Absolutely one of the best shows on television.  I cannot wait until the next week for another episode.
B00DVFR8QA,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",4,Like the premise of this show.  Very different.  Deals with a serial killer who is trying to draw attention to the deaths in Mexico.  The bridge is the bridge that separates San Diago and Mexico.  The killer is placing the bodies on the line that separates the two.  Also he is taking different body parts and putting them together.  We enjoyed the one episode we did watch.
B00DVFR8QA,Roger E. Ervast,5,Cool show with quirky characters and off the wall plot but fun to watch (for me)
B00DVFR8QA,Stanley Cook,5,Outstanding show. And season 2 has started just as good.
B00DVFR8QA,Sunshine247365,5,The writing and acting is aboslutely superb.  I can't wait to watch the 2nd season.  I highly recommend this TV show to anyone that enjoys thrillers.
B00DVFR8QA,Tim O'Brien,5,This is the best series I've seen in awhile.  The at times tension and then comradeship between the two detectives is terrific to watch.  I want them to catch every monstrously evil person out there.
B00DVFR8QA,Timothy McGivney "Tim",5,The acting and writing are sensational and I can't wait for Season 2! I particularly like Annabeth Gish's ice queen portrayal of a widowed gold digger. Deserves Emmys all around.
B00DVFR8QA,WLee,5,Loved it watched it straight through with my husband who loved it as well. Annabeth and Diane really are a dynamic duo although the characters would never be viewed that way unless you watch the show and grow with them as they do.
B00DVN14XU,Mike suell,5,So funny
B00DVN14XU,Ms KAM,3,This movie is just ok. There were long stretches in this movie where I didn't laugh and there were moments where I only chuckled.
B00DVN14XU,Thea "Urbana",5,I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a movie for a popcorn and movie night.
B00DW2RAB0,bcre8tiv,4,My son is almost two and he requests Caillou every time. It teaches manners and vocabulary that is interesting to kids. We love being able to watch it through Amazon Prime instead of only being able to watch it on PBS.
B00DW2RAB0,Jeannie,5,My granddaughter loves watching Caillou.  We have done many things with her that Caillou does with his parents and grandparents.
B00DW2RAB0,J. Jordan,5,reviewed volume 6 got 7 for the same reasons my 2 year old grandson loves the shows and on the go it is perfect for keeping him contient.
B00DW2RAB0,mongiesgirl,5,My 2 yr old grandson loves Caillou. He becomes transfixed when I put it on. They have controlled the whiney behavior  of Caillou in the later seasons which has made it so much more enjoyable to watch with him. Some of the episodes teach social interactive skills and some educational and some just fun.
B00DX6Q3VI,Amazon Customer,3,They are brave people and have come a long way in the past 2 years. As long as they remain a family and remember what is truly important.
B00DX6Q3VI,kelly,5,Love this show couldn't wait for it to come on amazon!! Cant wait till next weeks episode to see what happens
B00DX6Q3VI,Nick,3,Watching sister wives is a unusual show about a man having four wives and often wonder what its like to marry with two men.
B00DXF6LMU,926 Daytripper "926daytripper",4,I love this show...this is the only show on TV that I make sure I am available to watch. Cindy Crawford's show was a little over the top but the other shows are very believable.  I would like to see more continuity in the format.
B00DXF6LMU,Amy,5,Great show to see how ones family has impacted history and to learn more about your family.  Can't wait to see more seasons.
B00DXF6LMU,Lora Hunt,5,I was so disappointed when they discontinued this show a couple of years ago. Now that it's back I no longer have cable (I'm a full time RVer!). I'm so thrilled that Amazon offers this show so I can download it to my Kindle fire HD!
B00DXF6LMU,Marta Betts "Marta Betts",5,This show inspires me to want to learn more about my own history. I just wish using Ancestry.com wasn't so expensive to use.
B00DXI1R44,Amazon Customer "LABMONKEY",4,This is a new Batman style (just like 'The Batman' was Batman but different). The characters have been tweaked. Alfred is more like an MI6 operative and Katana is new. The popular old villains you'd recognize have not surfaced yet either. A good change from the 'usual'.
B00DXI1R44,Eli "-Eli-",5,Maybe its just the giddy feeling when I see a new take on a character but this show is bound for greatness and the reasons are simple and are all in the first episode. Although they have changed the physique of two of Batman's major allies; It matters not for in the end the dynamic between the characters is correct and fun. Can't wait to see the fem-fetal Robin. Plus the one great thing about this show as a little factoid: you'll notice only a couple names still on the credits from Batman: TAS because DC purposely wanted this show to be done by completely fresh blood aka NOT BABY BOOMERS.
B00DXI1R44,G. Lett "George",5,Keeps up the tradition of the previous Batman serious that were good as well. Viewing Batman in HD is awesome!
B00DXI1R44,Mike,5,Excellent animation a lot of action lots of  suspence and mystery and good acting and always makes you wanting more
B00DXI1R44,Sr Happy Popi "Mr. Stacy J.",3,It's OK.  My best Batman fan and I watched this show.  We liked other versions better ('the Brave and the Bold' or the original 'the Animated Series').  Maybe we'll take watch another episode as the series progresses.
B00DY87WQA,Barbara Watson,5,This rather stuffy show presents information which makes all the period shows which rely on the different classes interacting much more interesting and understandable.
B00DY87WQA,GrammeK,5,I really enjoyed seeing & hearing about the history of these beautiful British palaces & the families who lived there.
B00DY87WQA,Karen L. Ball,4,It was fascinating to see the history of the first  episode of the King Henry VIII castle where his wives lived.I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about British history.
B00DY87WQA,kellej,5,It was really interesting to see the transformations of all these iconic estates!  How they have been run and managed over the years was intriguing.  I was interested to see how family was selected to be the guardian over these lovely homes
B00DY87WQA,Verna Metzger,5,I loved this because of the lovely settings and history of all the estates. Really gives me more reasons to want to go back and visit England again and see them for myself!
B00DYGTXUU,Amy,5,Love to see what each person can think up in terms of Make up. I love the creativity of each person and look forward to many more seasons of creativity
B00DYGTXUU,Basketville,4,Love all these . .I always admire anyone who is really good and talented at there jobs.  These people are really imaginative and its fun to watch them work under time restraints
B00DYGTXUU,Helen Thomas,5,Love seeing talented individuals support one another and express their gift in creative ways.  Hope to see this caliber often
B00DYGTXUU,Jennifer Lally "Jenny Lally",4,This is definitely an improvement on the previous series and the artists are of a much higher caliber. The show structure is much the same but with better artists and challenges it is back to being an engrossing show. It is so good to see this show righting its self after a wobbly season 4
B00DYGTXUU,Katherine Young,5,Much higher quality work than last season. Also it is a true fan season. Many favorites were back to prove how amazing they really are had so much more to give than many that came before.
B00DYGTXUU,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",3,Face off is a amazing show I only watch one episode but it was amazing. for the video itself there where no problems what so ever. I recommend this to people who love art and movies.
B00DYGTXUU,Timothy Black,5,Face Off is a great show. I love watching even episode. I'm learning Special Effects myself show watching helps me!
B00DYPQYZ8,Alice M. Grove "The Little Harpist",5,This is a fascinating series and it is so well done that it is even worth watching more than once.  I always learn from these shows and that is important to me.  They are factual and well done.
B00DYPQYZ8,beth holman,5,I good series of mysteries and stories we know and don't. I highly recommend for ages 15 and up. Good for history fans.  Also some make you cry.
B00DYPQYZ8,Louis J MaSCITELLO,4,Has been at the forefront of producing some of PBS' documentaries for AGES.  Every bit as well done as you've come to expect.
B00DYPQYZ8,Patrice L. Geathers "yenomden",5,Very interesting documentary. The film quality was outstanding and did not freeze not once. I truly enjoyed these series. How to see a lot more of these.
B00DYPQYZ8,TomG "CW Junkie",5,Always looking for a new episode to watch during the TV dog days of summer. Can't get enough of these history lessons.
B00DYQ2MYO,Customer,1,This tv show is just very boring and weird. Also the animation is absolutely repulsive and sore on the eyes. Its the kind of show that makes me wonder if the people at cartoon network are crackheads.
B00DYQ2MYO,Paul Aguirre,5,Great season I love it I hope they keep this show going for a long time :) one the best shows cartoon network has made in a long time
B00DYQAT8K,Amazon Customer,5,So good I had to watch it twice.  Hope there are more episodes in the series.  You will too if you watch.
B00DYQAT8K,Angie,4,Fast moving story with good plot but had to watch it more than once to catch all the language and characters named. By the third of the series we caught onto the background plot and were hooked on the mystery. Would like to see another season on Prime membership.
B00DYQAT8K,artist in residence "artist in residence",5,wanted more but I guess there is only the one season.  This could have gone for a couple more seasons.  liked the actors and story lines.
B00DYQAT8K,Cat,4,As always Masterpiece theater or anything British is excellent.I like the actors and the scripts...it's a bit harsh and I could justslap the head guy but that's just because he portrays a type thatis so typically arrogant that you do just wish they would vanish.But that is because it's such a well written part and perfectlyacted..
B00DYQAT8K,Craig S. Werner "The Grumpy Old Squid",5,This is another of the British Mystery Series of shows.Very well done on the order of the &#34;Foyle's War&#34; series.Worth watching.
B00DYQAT8K,Cynthia W. Wright,5,Masterpiece Theatre - Always ExceptionalLoved everything about it.  I recommend Amazon Primeand Masterpiece Theatre to everyone!  Always showsthat are premier and way above average.
B00DYQAT8K,Dean Collins,4,This BBC production is based on Tyburn who was a police officer in England that moved to Narobi to become the Superintendent of the police force there.  Good mystery and I wished they had made more than one season.
B00DYQAT8K,Dennis Charpentier,4,This is an interesting series that delivers exciting content and insite into colonial attitudes and lifestyle. Recommend this series to all detective buffs.
B00DYQAT8K,Diana Wise,3,It was good but I lost interest in it pretty quick. Maybe I'll try again later but right now I think it was a little stale.
B00DYQAT8K,emersontwain,5,Great storyline. Great Casting. Great Looking!  Great Great Great  Atmospheric pot boiler with mystries woven into a love story and social comentary. Costume drama at its most enjoyable.
B00DYQAT8K,E. Saltbush,4,The physical presence of the lead actor is reason enough to watch. I've never been to Africa but this seems to do a good job of expressing the them/us I've read about when Europeans went into Africa.
B00DYQAT8K,Faithful Scott,4,Heat of the Sun is a riveting film with a tight plot and an excellent cast. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B00DYQAT8K,JJMRVCLINY "JimMLINY",5,Knew nothing of this show.  Picked it on a whim from recommendations.  It turned out to be just short of riveting if you are minutely interested in the history of the era.  The ensemble interaction is just shy of perfect.  The intrigue and innuendo keeps ones interest.  Just watch it!
B00DYQAT8K,J. N. McCarthy,4,The mysteries are well presented with twists and unexpected turns.  Enjoy watching as the mysteries unwind.  Worth a look and if you like mysteries you will like Heat of the Sun.
B00DYQAT8K,J. Otoole,4,Interesting characters hero is Dirty Harry  Sherlock Holmes combo a continuing story but each episode has a conclusion. Nice  scenery of the countryside in Africa.
B00DYQAT8K,Kindle Customer,5,I was delighted to discover Heat of the Sun was available on my Kindle Fire.  I had seen it when it first was released and truly loved it.  The settings are so true to colonial Africa and the costuming and attitude toward native peoples consistent with behavior at that time.  The story line is also well developed and interesting.  I highly  recommend Heat of the Sun.
B00DYQAT8K,Knight68 "EM",4,This series was great.  The storylines  were such that they kept you guessing what would come next.  Why they did not continue with this series is a deeper mystery than the show presented.  If they ever bring it back I would be lined up to watch it.
B00DYQAT8K,Peggy H. Rose,5,This was a very enjoyable series to watch. Well done and well acted.  We wish there were more of them - or more like this one.
B00DYQAT8K,salt94,5,I liked the series. Good stories and I enjoy the era. Not too deep but moved along very well. I think you will enjoy!
B00DYQAT8K,Sam,5,I love this show it is well done and the cast is super. The story lines are engaging and well thought out clearly this series is worthy of inclusion in the PBS Masterpiece series.
B00DYQAT8K,Stephen Ingraham "lightshedder",5,I only wish there were more! Great acting. Great story lines. Excellent setting. Just well done! And I am a sucker for Africa anyway.
B00DYQAT8K,Tenderfoot,4,This was a BBC find with my Prime membership. It proved as pretty much always with BBC to be right up my alley. Great story. Handsome lead man. beautifully shot. Quality program.
B00DYQAT8K,toni gulotta,5,I love everything by Masterpiece theather/ mystery and this was no exception.  only thing disappointing was there are only five episods.
B00DYQAT8K,Verna Metzger,5,Susannah Harker was in Pride & Prejudice and it was a pleasure to see her in this. Interesting story lines and a bit of Africa.
B00DYZGII6,Amazon Customer,5,I still really love this show but I feel like they're focusing a lot on the drama between the designers these days. That being said -this season had some truly talented designers (albeit some truly weird ones as well) that had great personalities and I looked forward to seeing their creations each week. I thought the changes this season were good ones. The blind runway makes sense because surely judges start to have favorites at some point. SPOILER - I think the Tim Gunn save went to the wrong person but I think it's a good idea for him to be able to rescue a designer. The judges and Tim getting a close up of the designs was fun to watch and I'm glad they took craftsmanship very seriously this season.
B00DYZGII6,Jdances "bdancer",5,I heart this show.  This was one of the best seasons.  Heck they out do themselves every season.  The show just gets better and better.  DOM RULES!!! Great choice judges!
B00DYZGII6,Julius Weber,3,Project runway is an advertising reality TV show about fashion. The episodes are scripted as are the judges' comments and indeed all of the dialogue and drama. It exists mainly to promote fashion products with the illusion of huge prizes. It's basically a chick show abounding with fantasy.
B00DYZGII6,kelly,5,I love this show because it gives me inspiration to dress for fashionable and I love Tim and Heidi together
B00DYZGII6,S. mcpherson "McSarah",5,If I could give this season 100 stars I would!! The added bonus of the "Tim Gunn Save" along with some interesting challenges and some very passionate contestants make for an absolutely fantastic season!!!!!
B00DYZGII6,St Johns,5,Loved this season best among all of them---so much talent in one place!!  Loved some of the background stories and was blown away by Justin.  Dom's final Retro collection was remarkable and rather reminded me of stained glass windows.  Am hoping something in that line will make area stores where I purchase.  Loved the save by Tim G and thought that was unique. It is so much fun to watch the manufacturing process and then make my own decision on who I would choose to win each week. Really like that you took the team away from their normal atmosphere for field trips.  Nature does provide a great deal of insight to our lives so hope you continue in that area.  Thanks to all at PR and to Amazon for having this available.
B00DZJIRFI,Amanda C.,4,I've enjoyed this show since the beginning this season had some good moments but the main character wasn't as &#34;spy like&#34; as they have shown her in the past. I was slightly disappointed in her skill set but they did present her with more challenges it was just an ok series to lose some time watching
B00DZJIRFI,Amazon Customer "Glenn",5,Great season. This is one of the rare shows that just keep getting better. This season is all about bringing down Henry.
B00DZJIRFI,Amazon Customer "Grandpa Jack",4,I enjoy this program. The only draw back for me is that I am getting tired of the romance and would like a little more action or intrigue. Loved Seasons 1-3; 4 seems &#34;slower&#34;. Still would recommend it.
B00DZJIRFI,Amazon Customer,3,I wish I could leave a one word review - because all this review would say is &#34;meh&#34;. I used to really like this but somewhere along the way it got kind of weird and I stopped caring about what happened to the characters.
B00DZJIRFI,amrbilly,5,what a show this show keep on your feet and never know what will happen next it want you to catch the bad guy but couldn't...this will!
B00DZJIRFI,Ann M. Hoffman,5,This is one of the best programs I have watched in a long tome. When it started Annie had no gun but later she did and did some bed hopping I thought cheapened the program but will still watch
B00DZJIRFI,Blue Moose,3,A spy thriller that has a little different twist than most.
B00DZJIRFI,C. D. Simmons "Doug Simmons-Old Timer",5,Like the series
B00DZJIRFI,Chloe,5,Covert Affairs is an awesome series. I love the way the characters have grown through out the seasons with a lot of unexpected twist and turns.
B00DZJIRFI,cynthia,5,This is really a good series. Lots of twists and turns.
B00DZJIRFI,DAE,5,Love this show.  Its fast pace and female lead character make it a good choice.
B00DZJIRFI,D. Barabino,5,Covert Affairs has been an interesting show to watch.This season is the best where Annie is more mature and takes more risks as a spy. I do not regret purchasing it.
B00DZJIRFI,Debra Brodersen,4,I love that they have a female spy and a blind guy as a handler.  Very good bad guy as well.
B00DZJIRFI,D. Light,3,I enjoy Piper Perabo. But Auggie disappears in too many of the shows. But it is getting better this season.
B00DZJIRFI,Donald L. Ashmore,5,The stars in Covert Affairs are well chosen and believable.  The show is full of suspense and never boring or predictable.  Haven't missed a show yet.  Highly recommend to those who enjoy this type of drama.  Look forward to each and every episode.
B00DZJIRFI,Donkey,5,This is a great show and I love it because of CIA drama. It is not that hard to follow and is exciting with all kinds of action and twists and turns.
B00DZJIRFI,Doug Henning,5,Best show on USA Network with attractive actors especially the lead and good stories and locations.  Easy way to catch up before the new season started this week.
B00DZJIRFI,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,This show has evolved from a good show to a great one the last two seasons.  I can't wait to see how they are going to end this one.
B00DZJIRFI,drscot,5,Annie always pleases along with her co-stars. It is one of our favorites. She is just enough naughty to make it fun without being slutty.
B00DZJIRFI,edith banes,5,This season is excellent.  Lots of twists. Looking forward to the mid season finale.  It suggests Annie dies but we know that can't be true.  Sure hope they don't leave the mid season with that hanging in the air.
B00DZJIRFI,Ellen H. Center,5,This is a very exciting season on Covert Affairs and it is well written and certainly holds my interest.Trying to take down the vilian of this show is very interesting and exciting.  Bravo to Covert Affairs
B00DZJIRFI,Frank,5,Entertaining without being hard to follow. Good show and will watch next season. A good mix of characters and story line.
B00DZJIRFI,Genavee,5,I love the intrigue of this season and happy that Annie and Auggie is together ! I love this show!
B00DZJIRFI,George Brecht,5,Great series that did a good job of balancing various story lines well.
B00DZJIRFI,Inky,4,This is as good as other seasons. A few new twists to keep your interest. If you liked it before you will stay with it.
B00DZJIRFI,JANE EYRE,2,I don't like her rebelling against Augie. For me Augie made the show and her responses to him and when she worked with him were great.
B00DZJIRFI,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",4,Really keeps you wondering what the writers are thinking as you try to guess where the plot line is really going. There are some corny things about it but it is on par for what you might expect.
B00DZJIRFI,Lois Langston,5,This is an exciting and action packed series. Caveats go to the script writing and never ending surprises. Truly an adventure in espionage.
B00DZJIRFI,M. Anderson,5,Sometimes it's hard when I series mixes things up (changes people's roles) but the mix up that happened in this season made everything so exciting and makes me look forward to Season 5!!!
B00DZJIRFI,Mary E. Shipman "LizMoves",5,This is one of my favorite shows.  The storyline is terrific and evolving.  The female leads are strong and powerful.  The acting is great.  Can't wait for next season!
B00DZJIRFI,Michelle Gould,5,Characters are well developed and bring their life's into your home.
B00DZJIRFI,MVP,4,Very good but didn't crank up to my expectations. I had seen the cast interview before and they alleged that this was the best yet. I'm not quite certain that is the case
B00DZJIRFI,Opinionbyme,5,It was getting a little of the same ol.. same ol...  And then there's more.Season 4 is the best so far and episode 10 was a real shocker.Love this show and it's hard to wait for the next episode 10/18
B00DZJIRFI,Patricia Appelquist,3,Gee did you see that coming well they spelled it out for you in three episodes so you should have guessed by now. The bad guys win and the good guys don't but really at least in the last episode she didn't have to run in heels maybe we get to see joanhave a baby but id rather watch Auggie take his shirt off again and again
B00DZJIRFI,Patricia M. Brown,4,I really like Covert Affairs because it's decently realistic. Like all the actors and the characters they play. Love Auggie and Annie and have watched the series since the premier of season 1.
B00DZJIRFI,Randall von Schoeler "Garden Guru",5,We having been watching from the beginning on Amazon Prime.  The story lines are excellent as usual.  A must watch.
B00DZJIRFI,rbhatta "A Dinosaur you can trust!",5,The Season 4 has a tons of action and will keep you on the edge of your seat. You do tend to like the characters if you were following the previous seasons. Acting and presentation is top notch which keeps you glued to the series. Season 4 ends amicably well and I am happy to learn that USA network has renewed the series for more butt kicking action in season 5. Wonder where will Annie go? - can't wait.. Excellent series... Worthy of five stars!
B00DZJIRFI,R. L. Hearn,5,I keep thinking they will run out of ideas of places for Annie to go and things for her to do but they keep coming up with new things.
B00DZJIRFI,Ruth@the movies,5,Augie made his move and they are a couple now...still watching and interested in this years shows!  Get it and watch.
B00DZJIRFI,Shirley White,5,The story lines and the acting are great!  If you like spy stories you will really like this.All of the episodes are compelling.  Watch it.  You will see.
B00DZJIRFI,Sissy Kirsteen,5,This Series is exceptional for a TV show.  The characters have depth and the story has one sitting on the edge of one's seat. I highly recommend this whole series of Covert Affairs.
B00DZJIRFI,S. Marsh,5,The stories have grown more serious as she has become a more seasoned agent. I love all the characters. Can't wait for the new season to start.
B00DZJIRFI,smashbox24cr,4,Riveting. Some plot twists are predictable typical for the genre but it is alright beccause the acting is pretty good
B00DZJIRFI,SoCal Mom,5,this story continues to be a winner.. lots of action.. lots of fun and drama.. great sympathetic characters.. easy to give five stars!
B00DZJIRFI,Thomas Waring,5,I cannot wait until the next season begins. This is really a very good show with great plots and excellent acting.
B00DZJIRFI,TKD Fan,5,I enjoyed this series very much.  It kept you guessing what the next twist would lead too.  Don't miss it!
B00DZJIRFI,Tom,5,This show keeps getting better and better. Amazing how many foreign locations are used. Great production value. Good story lines.
B00DZJIRFI,Toni5000,4,I like the show but I thought this season went too long with out justification to get the bad guy (who seemed to have super hero powers).
B00DZJIRFI,TW,3,Well for a show that started out with great intent of keeping it somewhat tame. They are getting to the point of (This is a show not intended for children to watch) Many adult situations in it. More Drama than seasons before. All I can say is if you have children under the age of 18 this is a show they shouldn't watch. That of course is my opinion. But I'm a person that has morals as many these days clearly do not.
B00E0H0R98,SR,4,This family is so hilarious. I love that they are EXACTLY who they are. They are genuine people with genuine problems and mishaps who really care about each other. There is never a dull moment with this family. You will laugh your butt off!
B00E0H0R98,Tanesha L. Barkley,4,Joy on The View always talked about something they was doing on that show. This show makes me laugh. Alana (Honey's real name) I am not sure but She is one of those little girls in the talent shows and tiaras. yet the story has some touching parts  what is really true and what is fiction.
B00E1BF0KE,A. Fast,3,I bought it because I am a Ryan Gosling fan.The storyline was okay but the movie plodded in spots. The end was interesting.I would recommend this to someone who is a Gosling fan but don't expect Gangster Squad!
B00E1BF0KE,Arish "A+",3,This is clearly a love or hate affair or like me try to see the good in it. This is a good movie by many standards but also a disappointment. The Cinematography is amazing like Drive. The characters were extremley cool looking and interesting but very underdeveloped. I loved Drive so much I really wanted to see similarities. But Nicolas clearly wanted to make that statement clear this is not a HERO. Basically Ryan was the same character but not as aggressive and extremley pathetic I hate to say. The soundtrack was good as usual but not as good as DRIVE. This soundtrack carried out more like a pulsating score.The gore aspect was interesting but seemed sort of unnessary unlike in DRIVE. This clearly could have been Drive Part II if the story was more developed. The trailer plays it out that way but this is not the case at all. This is not a revenge story it more of a story of weakness. This clearly doesn't focus around JULIAN(RYAN) but a crooked Cop that doesn't mind killing. It seems like the cop was the hero in this film and was the villian also :(. What a creative and missed opportunity for a really great film. This could have continued were the last left off. And he could have fled to Bangkok and the gangsters could have been trying to take him out there.Instead we get a movie the looks like DRIVE cosmetically . But could have actually been Drive but its muttled mess that looks like it was based off Drive but not. Nicolas Refn really needs to co-write with someone this was a missed opportunity for him. He could have really proved him self after Drive. Hopefully he will try harder on the next film which seems interesting With Cary mulligan in it also from DRIVE and SHAME. With the expectations that was set for him after the last film . I am really surprised he would have tarnished Ryan Goslings heroic character. Such a cool character that could have went so many directions even in sequels. Not to meantion the whole mute thing really worked in Drive. My theory is tough guys don't talk they do. To have someone lose over and over again what is the point? To say he his avenging his brother but losing every battle ..what is the point? Point made I guess if he set out to show that good guys finish last then he made his point. Nothing this director has done in the past has been accessable Bronson was just ok . Its obvious he know how to do cinematography and create interesting characters. What a missed opportunity for him to be the next big thing like David lynch or Quintin Tarantino .If you like this then check out :ShameGirls against boysKiss of the DamnedPassionBreaking the GirlsStokerThe lifeguardByzantiumAlbatrossNobody WalksLovelaceDisconnectThe EastAmerican MaryExcision
B00E1BF0KE,Carlos A. Hermida "Carlos",5,Great picture. A must see.
B00E1BF0KE,Cward55,1,See I really liked and got the whole point of Drive. I really did enjoy the film this though on the other hand I hated with a passion which is the directors follow up film. Literally the movie makes no sense to me except that Gosling's brother gets killed by a crazy vigilante type cop because his brother is doing some very bad things ( oh ya and to mention everyone in this movie is not likeable and I could not stand any of them. They are all psychos and what not). So gosling takes it upon himself to seek out some revenge. I mean you can watch this movie but it is complete garbage but once again that is just one persons opinion. To me a very big disappointing movie because I wanted to like it but hated it instead.
B00E1BF0KE,Lorraine M. Jessee,3,A bit heavy and brutal for me.  There are movies that offer Ryan Gosling a better avenue for this talent.  I would not watch this movie a second time.
B00E1BF0KE,Michael,3,While I like gosling and I don't mind subtitles this movie just didn't do it for me. I can't quite put my finger on why but I think it mostly how the plot developed. Eh.
B00E1BYFP0,Dstress,4,Really funny not really scary but an enjoyable filck. The setting in Ireland was perfect and added to the atmosphere of the film. The actors were very likeable and the monster was cool.
B00E1BYFP0,Janet,4,It starts out a little slow but picks up speed.  Impressive special effects-and I like the scene with the little grabbers in the pub.
B00E1BYFP0,Tetris911,5,I was not expecting much from this movie but since I am a diehard fan of horror/monsters/aliens/scifi/etc movies I just had to see this and I was glad I did! If you like a fun yet silly movie with good and likeable characters like Shaun of the Dead or Attack the Block then check out Grabbers!
B00E2OTIIK,LOUISE,5,I rally like thia  mini series. It follows the book pretty much. I have read the books. Cannot wait for second season.
B00E2OTIIK,Seth C. Howard "pops",4,this will fill the bill . educated and still almost clueless woman . that part GUYS will enjoy . Andie is as beautiful as ever .
B00E3INI7C,Charles K. Gorga,2,I was un-happy about the movie that I ended it early on. I like moore action films then this movie.
B00E3INI7C,todd,1,i did not like the grouping of the actionated flick so that is why i am giving this season flick  a bad rating in review ...
B00E3P3JG0,cg showalter,1,I couldn't get through it...too slow and too dark (content)...didn't hold my attention! Might try it again later but not sure.
B00E3P3JG0,Danny L. Abernathy,3,haven't watched yetbut anything frank langella is in is goodone og the best actors to not get any due
B00E3P3JG0,K.S. "Sunshine",3,The Time Being about Artist struggling to be successful.
B00E59AF02,Co-op Granny,3,There is little competition or excitement but it is fun to see what they create. The styles and skills also liven up the programs. I will continue to watch to the end!
B00E59CJQ0,H. J. Sage "historian-writer",2,There's no there there. The film takes a long time going nowhere. Olivia Wilde is a fine actress but she's wasted here. Seems to be the product of our current culture--mindless superficial in many ways.
B00E712NYO,Mootsie,5,I keep checking to see if there is a new one.  There were so few episodes in the first season. But it was fun to watch.
B00E712NYO,normaporter,5,I like a good scare and this shows can scare you eight. I watch it each week it is onand love it/
B00E8ANEQA,Larry Baker,5,This show is excellent.  The acting is much better than I expected.  I would recommend this show for anyone 18 and above.
B00E8ANEQA,Mark "mdgross",4,I'm sorry it was only 1 season.  Though it's supposed to be carried over into at least a mini-series called Sam Hunter.  She steals the show.  The plot pulls you in and it was hard to stop watching.
B00E8ANEQA,T. Brady "Tom",5,I bought this and was extremely surprised at how well it was put together.  Action is from start to finish making it a part of the best of the bunch.  If there is anything else out there like this one I DEFINITELY will buy it.
B00EAI9R1Q,Jack E. Levic,2,THE CANYONS is a dark film that seems to lose direction from the beginning. Acclaimed director Paul Schrader has gotten lost in a troubled project. Real-life porn actor James Deen stars as movie producer Christian and Lindsay Lohan as his girlfriend Tara. Both live on the wild sexual side as Tara reconnects with an old flame who happens to be Christian's assistant's boyfriend. Everyone seems to have some sort of connection from the past as Christian manipulates and controls all the people around him. Chaos ensures as the lies and deceptions begin to  ruin lives. Christian's dark side emerges and nothing will be the same.There is a story here that gets lost in a world of confusion. The viewer does get drawn into the chaos and the desire to know how this will all work out.The film does almost border on soft porn at times so it can be difficult to understand what is actually happening. A great deal of the film is simply scenes of people driving or walking--walking down a street or climbing stairs or walking down a hall. It is vaguely interesting and there seems to be a hint of a desire to create an art film that falls flat.
B00EC7VQX2,Carolyn Stewart "Can't get enough arty stuff",4,From an era I don't relate to but the eye candy and sets are so interesting. Keep it coming! Please.
B00EC7VQX2,Jason Nisanov,5,This was one of the best seasons for the show.  I can't wait to watch the last one and see how the show comes to a close
B00EC82O8M,starshining4ever,5,The two families move to the country. Never saw that coming! Different take on the show as now it's not  "city life."
B00ECU20HA,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,This is good!!  Sort of a flash back to some of the things I noticed as a child this age.  Is a subject more speak of in 2013 than they did back in the 60's.  Give a watch is worth the small cost to buy and add to the &#34;video library&#34;  Am glad I did.  Is the only spot I could find to watch on line.
B00ECU20HA,Mootsie,5,Little kids remembering their past lives.  Who knows?  Anythings possible with an open mind.  The children's testimony on the this show sounds pretty convincing.  It's entertaining and thought provoking.  I am enjoying it so far.
B00EDG3GQ2,Catherine T. Burnes "Catherine T.",5,Most of us need an occasional reminder of what it means to be a proud American.  This series of informative and entertaining documentaries is definitely worth the time to view it.
B00EDG3GQ2,eblebl,5,Nothing beats this type of journalism...It's a lot better than watching over-sensationalized news broadcast on your local TV channels.  This is way more entertaining and educational.
B00EDG3GQ2,john mager,5,very good .very good learning experience .I hope a lot of young people watch these super learning experience. I don't think they show  this type in schools any moor. to much sports an pc.  no reading writing and arithmetic and no apple for the teacher.?
B00EDG3GQ2,norma jean kringer,5,This is an exceptional program since the footage makes the history much clearer and all I learned from school needs add-ons.  This is the program that pretty much fills in the big blanks
B00EDG3GQ2,William J. Landon,5,The American Experience is a thoughtful and well produced documentary series. The topics are well handled and are presented in an even handed way. The depth that the series presents the topics are well suited to the length of the programs (between 1 and 1.5 hours). This is a great program to choose if you wish to know more about the issues that make up who we are as Americans and where we have come from.
B00EE2W1GG,Agentss "Dana",5,Wonderful fun and very educational series for the entire family.Something everyone should watch and you will love it for sure.
B00EE2W1GG,beth holman,5,About people from 21 century go back not time travel rent a manor and servants live like 1905 people.did. I highly recommend it.  Real life people doing this not actors.
B00EE2W1GG,C. A. Neal,2,They tried to make a reality show off of the success of Downton Abbey. It didn't work. It did not hold my attention. I did not care about the people on the show. I didn't find it one bit interesting. Skip it.
B00EE2W1GG,Cat in NoCal,4,I enjoyed this series very much.  Life was difficult enough in the times of the great manor houses without having to deal with the upstairs/downstairs division between the classes.  I thought this replication of the times was very realistic.  I loved the butler; I felt he played his role perfectly and had I worked for him I would have both respected him and felt a great deal of affection for him as well.
B00EE2W1GG,chai,5,I thought this was great to watch before the new season of Downton Abbey comes out in January. I love PBS.
B00EE2W1GG,Fran's Fanciful Folly,5,The acting and the story line was excellent.  It provides many hours of entertainment.  We highly recommend this outstanding series.
B00EE2W1GG,grands,4,We enjoyed this show & thought it was very enlightening.  Don't think most of us would survive life in service in those days.Most of the servants worked like mules & physically & emotionally extremely difficult life.
B00EE2W1GG,Joan M. Poole,4,Interesting show.  This portrays a modern day family going back in time to the early 1900's.  Not sure if I personally would be able to survive this type of living.  The servants were basically treated like dirt and there was never a nice word said to any of them as to please and thank you--that I could not stand at all--it ticks me off today when people are rude.
B00EE2W1GG,jv,5,Except it came out before Downton.  I remember watching it on PBS and enjoying it and this was in part responsible for me getting into Downton.  i started re-watching this and enjoying it just as much the second time.
B00EE2W1GG,kindlelover,5,Very interesting experiment with nonactors attempting to live as they did in a Manor House. Class destinctions all fine unless you are downstairs and not up. Lots of detail explaining how things worked and Downton Abbey fans will most likely be intrigued.
B00EE2W1GG,Lawrence Rivett Jr. "Elvis Mercury",4,This experiment of modern day people trying to recreate the conditions of an English manor house during the Edwardian period is very eye opening.  Gives a good perspective on the class differences at the time and the conditions that those in service had to endure for the life of leisure for the ruling class. Worth the watch for any history lover.
B00EE2W1GG,Marie "Marie",5,I found it very interesting on all levels of how the people were treated. The rules made no sense when it came to relations among the staff.
B00EE2W1GG,Matthew Dobeck "Matt",4,One of the better &#34;House&#34; series.  I think the upstairs family were a bit too serious and it would have been nice to see how they really acted and lived in this century.  The head butler seriously got way too into it as well.  All in all a great series.
B00EE2W1GG,Patricia A. Jones "Bookworm",4,I felt the series was excellent in that it took the &#34;romance&#34; out of the life of the rich and titled in England.  The ruling class cared little for the people who made their lives so comfortable and pampered.  The lack of time off for rest and to see their families was bordering on cruelty toward those who could not fight back.
B00EE2W1GG,Serenity Rock,5,Intriguing insights into Edwardian class system.  A must see for those interested in pre World War I society in Great Britain.
B00EE2W1GG,shirley,5,I enjoyed watching Manor House. Trying to imagine myself in the Edwardian era was very interesting to me. Every one played a great part. As the slaves were to the grand plantations in our country so were the "service help" to the Manors in England. The portrayal of the characters and what they went through in 3 months built up to great relationships. It was sad when it ended.
B00EE2W7JM,Becky M. Brooks,5,The Frontline folks never let me down. I am so happy that Amazon give us access to the series on Prime.
B00EE2W7JM,Heidi Hill "Heidi704",5,Tons of great information and topics.  Very informative and interesting.  The episode on dental care was a real eye opener.
B00EE2W7JM,Judith Church,5,I read more and stay current on the major issues of the day - some call me a news junky. Frontline consistently chooses important issues and delves deeply - and I appreciate that.
B00EE2W7JM,Laval A. Thibodeau "mr.t.",5,Straight up reporting-without ad is the way to go! The wide variety of current topics keeps one on the edge of their seats.
B00EE2W7JM,Success,3,It's okay but stops short of really giving you a 4 or 5 Star performance. I have removed from my watchlist.
B00EE6I3QO,cottageprims,2,No actual show.They are just prepping you for the next season.I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it. Go directly to season 4 and they'll give you a recap.
B00EE6I3QO,Texman,4,Always interesting to see the miners quest to hit it big. The sound and picture quality is excellent. Every episode is an adventure.
B00EEXPDTM,Amit Talpade,3,This is a movie about the actress Linda Boreman Marchiano who starred in the classic porn film of the seventies Deep Throat. Amanda Seyfried stars as Linda who as a impressionable young woman is enticed by smooth talker Chuck Traynor who she marries. But marriage is not an escape or happiness for Linda who is forced by Traynor to star in Deep Throat a low budget porno film that turns her into a celebrity overnight and Traynor into a monster and abuses her regularly both physically and by pimping her for money. The film is about her life pre- and post Deep throat and then her eventual divorce with Traynor. Her later years and activism are highlighted but somehow the film does not manage to connect even though Seyfried and Sarsgaard try very hard.
B00EEXPDTM,Cyn,4,It's a very powerful story and told without being graphic. Definitely plays a role in history and the woman's movement.
B00EEXPDTM,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",4,I am a big fan of Amanda Seyfried. This is the main reason I watched the movie. It is a well made film. It was sad and depressing to see a woman treated this way.
B00EEXPDTM,NY rat "+",4,I enjoyed it. Acting was good. Didn't expect to see so much of Amanda.....she always plays such good giiiiiiiirls!  I liked how we saw another perspective later on....that was interesting and surprising...almost when you thought you knew it all. Heartbreaking.
B00EHANS0I,Eric W. Hutcheson "guyseattle",4,This episode gives and honest and frank look at how Meth has effected the city of San Francisco and it's citizens.  Starting out with HIV+ meth addict cody who's homeless and resorts to prostitution to pay for his meth habit.  Your taken into the infamous tenderloin and learn about the asian and mexican cartels.  Worth watching.
B00EHANS0I,jonny irish,5,Johnny Irish loves a good drug documentary and baby this is one I recommend the episode about Philadelphia it was one of my all-time favorites I found it very interesting to listen to commentary from someone who claims to be a heroin addict for 40 years that's a pretty good run for a junkie. You know what Johnny Irish says about rehab it's for quitters so put on your wife beater get a 40 ounce old English 800 put in the paper bag and roll up a fat one and watch this one respectfully Johnny Irish
B00EHANS0I,Scott Newton,3,Okay... depends on your taste.
B00EHNMUJU,becca,4,Always makes me laugh!! I love Mrs Kay and Phil and of course Si and Jase. I only gave it 4 stars be because seems like they are struggling for show ideas lately.
B00EHNMUJU,Dan Hertel,5,i didnt think i would like this show untill i started watching it i mean who wants to watch a bunch of people duck hunting but other duck hunters but i started watching and it is one of the funniest shows on tv
B00EHNMUJU,Erik Therme (author of Mortom),4,What can I say? If you like Ducky Dynasty seasons 1-3 you're probably going to like season 4 as well. More fun from the boys!
B00EHNMUJU,Jackino,5,Either you love the Roberts or you don't. I happen to love this show. I never miss an episode. I love the closeness of their family. There are not many shows that I wish would go on for as long as I live (definitely no new shows except this one) but this is one family I could watch anytime. THis new season does not disappoint.
B00EHNMUJU,Jenn Weiskopff,4,This season was just as hilarious as previous seasons. Only 4 stars because it is now more obvious that the shows are scripted.
B00EHNMUJU,Jessica Balyeat,5,My husband and I are hooked on these guys!!  Don't know what it is.. HILARIOUS at times and pure entertainment.
B00EHNMUJU,Judith Pritchard,5,Okay we all have people in our families that seem odd.  Watch this entertaining series and your family will look better and saner.
B00EHNMUJU,kelly,5,This show it my favorite show ever on A&E watch it every night definitely recommend this show to every one
B00EHNMUJU,Lois,5,Was great to see the next season and looking forward to even the next one  funny and enjoyable  very good.
B00EHNMUJU,Michelle DuBose,5,Love this family.  They teach great lessons in the way that they deal with each other on a daily basis.  Great family entertainment.
B00EHNMUJU,MrsGoose "MrsGoose",5,Continues to deliver funny episodes season after season of clean and wholesome fun:)  we love watching this show every week and can't wait for more episodes
B00EHNMUJU,RPC,5,Love this tv series always funny
B00EHNMUJU,S. Clark "Friend",5,I laughed the whole way through!  I purchased and watched it on Amazon. I love that I can lay in bed when I'm not feeling well and watch this hysterical family! It brings a lightness to my soul!
B00EHNMUJU,Stinky Greg,5,This is a great set of dvds at a great prices. We love the whole Duck Dynasty family and will enjoy many great hours watching this season.
B00EHNMUJU,susan,5,my family is a addicted to this family love their strength and humor and realness of their life they dont manufacture their story
B00EHNMUJU,Tayrtot,5,Fun wholesome show the whole family can watch & glad to see the family faith & prayer at end of show ! Way to go!!
B00EHNMUJU,Triciatx,5,I enjoy Duck Dynasty!  I laugh the whole time it is on and just enjoy the whole experience while watching it!
B00EHNMUJU,Veronica V.,5,I get a kick out of this show and will be watching it until it goes off the air. Happy happy happy.
B00EILN40A,JD GAYMAN,3,Not sure if it is scripted or not. Parts were entertaing. The partner should not have left when he did.
B00EIQJH8I,Le Magicien.,5,I love this show its always so entertaining. I would def recommend it this show been watching it for the past few seasons.
B00EIQJH8I,Lynn4399,5,Love this show!!  Three very different personalities placed together into one show.  All episodes are a &#34;hoot&#34; to watch!! BTW..Josh love your shoes/slippers and Madison....what a beautiful smile!!Lynn Jones
B00EJ630FS,Kindle Customer "knitting hobby",3,My grandson loves it. I fail to see any educational value. It is just a nice non violent cartoon.  Nothing spectacular .
B00EJ630FS,marymurban,5,My grandchildren loved this movie. Action packed and good lessons to teach any age. Thank you very much for a great movie.
B00EJLRV6M,Dwight,5,this episode is free on itunes as well as Amazon which is both generous and smart because Will looks like he is right next to you - YUM.I didn't watch episodes prior the adoption(s) and then I found this couple to be so nice and ATTRACTIVE but I think that these adoption episodes will elevate this show.  I had already considered buying one or more of the China episodes with Will.  It is amazing how he blossomed in the warmth of their company.These episodes totally SELL adoption.
B00EJLRV6M,g.hilary,5,Very happy upbeat show...I learned alot of what a &#34;little person/couplecoupes with different than myself. It isn't just how high things are to reachit is ..well see for yourself ...I highly recommend getting hooked as I haveon this series.
B00EJLRV6M,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",5,I really want the next series to start as I love watching the little couple. They are just the sweetest and most caring of couples. Loved it when the little son Bill comes into the picture.
B00EJLRV6M,the Commish!!!,5,my wife loved it !!! wishes more of the shows were free on prime so she could watch them and save
B00EM6MGHI,alllie,3,I finally stopped watching about halfway through the fifth episode because the music was so annoying. A little of it would have been okay but it was behind almost everything.
B00EM6MGHI,Alvin Campbell,4,This is an excellent overview of the the Celtic movement through history. As well as developing a curiosity (in me any way) to do more research.
B00EM6MGHI,Christine Poortenga,5,WOW! This is a well done and informative series. I didn't realize that I was learning so much. A must see for any European history buff
B00EM6MGHI,Eileen "mcdoogie",5,I have not finished watching this documentary but have seen enough to want to complete the series.  There is an historian that stated the celts never arrived in Britain or Ireland.  It is hard to know where he was going with this since he did not present any facts to prove his hypothesis.  Back to the drawing board fella!
B00EM6MGHI,E. Yeager,4,Finding out about one's ancestry seems to be the thing these days; and this series helps those of us who are Anglo-Saxon and Celtic in ancestry understand a little of our heritage.
B00EM6MGHI,Rene L. Hogan "R.L.Hogan",4,Show is interesting if you are curious about your Irish ancestry. Can be a bit dry at times otherwise a good program.
B00EM6MGHI,S. Hewitt,5,Since much of my family comes from Scotland and Ireland this series interests me a lot. Combine the rich and very interesting Celt history with music by Enya and it's a fantastic program.
B00EM76GQY,Cristina Hiatt,5,I love Zack bagans and crew.  Aaron is really gutsy.  The intelligent responses they get out of their machines gives one pause
B00EM76GQY,Gary R. Jordan,4,Most of the episodes are interesting.The way the GA guys go through investigating the past and using it for the present is what keep me watching.
B00EM76GQY,meg,1,This show was ok at one time. It was entertaining and the science is what sparked my attention. But there wasn't too much scientific evidence. I purchased more shows than I really should of but hey I was hoping for more proof of ghosts. Sometimes curiosity wins :)
B00ENYLR8I,AdrianaM,2,It was so boring I have to pass it forward. Although probably it is a market for this kind of movie.
B00ENYLR8I,DivineGrandma,4,I always look for unusual movies to watch and this ranked right up there.  The premise was very interesting and the execution of the story was also quite amusing.  Both actors were pretty good.
B00ENYLR8I,Don Montgomery,5,Love really does conquer all and these two actors won the battle that kept us engaged and wondering right to the very end. The story brought new meaning to friendship and acceptance and what it really means to make your best effort. Watch this surprising story for your self and some one who needs a boost.
B00ENYLR8I,htmcs,1,Way to weird  fit me. I have a difficult time with this type of film. I would not watch again.
B00ENYLR8I,Joyce Gilliland,1,i saw the &#34;f&#34; word was used liberally and i don't need any filthy words for entertainment. too bad hollywood hasn't grown up and cleaned up their vocabulary.
B00ENYLR8I,lorrie lennon,2,This was another one of those movies with lot's of dialogue that gets muddled by the sound team! There entire conversations between the two main characters that I could not understand! It's unfortunate because otherwise it was a good movie.
B00ENYLR8I,mouliin,4,Watched this movie because I have the same type of behavior struggles as the main character.  The movie was very sensitive; really charming.  I sincerely enjoyed the story and the approach to the subject.  A fun romance as well.  Recommend
B00ENYR02A,Charles J. Mcpeak "mcpeak2",5,Loved it! Purchased this for my mom and was drawn into the film. Great!
B00ENYR02A,Dan Hawks,3,I started watching this movie expecting a really good film. But was disappointed with some of the actors and the story line.It starts by this poor guy wanting to hunt down some meat for food. He accidentally shoots a woman thinking she was a deer. But she turns out to have some money on her .He is frowned upon for no other reason other than that he is poor and is caught poaching a couple of times. He comes upon some money taken from the woman he accidentally killed. She is about to flee with her drug dealing boyfriend before she is killed.That's when the tables start to turn the wrong way for the hunter.
B00ENYR02A,Robert S Zoller,1,What a complete farce. A very dark cinema of murder and mayhem. It stops there!!I wasted my money and paid a premium to see it 'before it is in the theatres'I do not give this even a star. As  a matter of fact it rates a minus 5 for me
B00EPCKUDG,Teddy and Me "JLEE",4,Love Judy Dench. This short film is really upbeat and entertaining. So refreshing to see the &#34;older set&#34; pursuing love in their lives. Very inspiring.
B00EPCKUDG,Who Am I? "Me!",5,This is a really great short.  It's only 12 minutes long so you can watch it any time to lift your spirits and see some great performances.Update:  I've noticed a lot of people are rating it lower just because they didn't have the insight to check the description before purchasing.  This is a SHORT film.  It says so clearly in the description.  It is not a full feature.  It's an excellent short film and well worth 1.99  If you want to spend a longer time watching you can get the collection of shorts this is from.  This is one of several films in the DVD "Stars in Shorts" which is a series of short flicks like this with different well known actors.  That one is also available on Amazon Instant Video.
B00ERVIDNO,Diva,4,I am still drinking milk and it I did not learn anything that I did not already know but it was interesting and had some funny elements to it as well.
B00ERVIDNO,Sandra E. Chatelain,4,I would watch this one again....and probably will.  The pros and cons of drinking milk and the milk production industry left me further convinced that limiting dairy surely will not kill me but that swilling lots of milk could.
B00ESB130I,Agentss "Dana",3,Great premise however at times the editing/poor audio editing makes it nearly non view able.  Some episodes they talk about an items and do not even show you the price it sold for Etc.
B00ESB130I,Darlene Walker,1,A show which can put you to sleep if you can.t sleep. Will keep trying but............we will see how it goes
B00ESB130I,Sherry H.,5,i had not seen this show before and was well pleased when i watched it.  the auctions are great and there is great variety.  really enjoyed.
B00ESB14V6,ddrevia,5,Love to watch Alton Brown whip up fun and yummy things. But very sad that it suddenly became a non prime viewing. &#128550;DeeDee
B00ESB14V6,Katharine S. Dupre "Writer & Book Lover",5,I always get a chuckle out of watching this cooking show and it makes me want to try out his recipes. I'm also glad that I can get this free of charge through amazon.com
B00ESB14V6,L. E. Langston "Gobbo",5,This show is so fantastic. It gives great incite to specific foods and cooling techniques and really makes you think about how to cook. The recipes are almost all worth trying too...
B00ESB14V6,Striving4Excellence,5,My daughter loves this show. She is learning so much from watching it.I just wish it was available in DVD at a price someone could afford.Until then we will keep watching it over and over again.
B00ESB15HY,Anthony J Perri,3,shows potential to improve with appealing cast of characters...sometimes it becomes a little too frenetic and wears me out...however will continue to watch it
B00ESB15HY,Barbara Hartwell "Tiarasncrwns",2,I am watching this program and with Robin Williams - he is trying so hard to be great with bad material. All the cast works well together but get some better scripts
B00ESB15HY,B. Merrill,2,Robin Williams is amazing I am not sure this show has any content left it is slowing down for me. It will make you laugh but every week seems to be the same stuff. I doubt I would watch a season 2 of this show.
B00ESB15HY,Peter Mancini,2,Episode 1 was boring. Too contrived. Its just not compelling to watch. Robin Williams is funny but that isn't enough to keep me interested for more than 5 minutes.
B00ESB15HY,Robert J. Quigley "specs",4,Where is the show on Amazon?  All there is i the sneak peek of the show.  Hasn't been on a few weeks now?
B00ESB5ET4,ali ali "ali082",5,Thank you Abby for sending jo jo home. All jo jo did was copy Asia's Choreography/  Jo Jo cannot dance with her annoying mouth and her MOM is a pain in my &#34;gluteus maximus.&#34;
B00ESB5ET4,Cadima,5,I love to watch the dancing and love Richie.  These kids are super talented and I'm amazed at the things they can do.  So inspiring!
B00ESB5ET4,Helen J Powers,5,Abbys ultimate dance is about the dancers. It is clearly a good time for the kids. It is just too bad that you need cable to access.
B00ESB5ET4,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,This show is hilarious.  Abbey is so out there.  She makes me laugh.  I also love to see the kids out there dancing and having fun.
B00ESB6CV8,Amazon Customer "Computer DOC",3,Didn't watch it past first 20 minutes. Not interested in the story. Watched it at all because it was free on Amazon Prime.
B00ESB6CV8,BM3,5,This show is so very funny. The cast of characters is new and fresh.  I hope it makes it a couple more seasons.
B00ESB6CV8,B. Merrill,5,I honestly like the show but I cant see it being around another season it honestly is a little too stupid to watch.
B00ESB6CV8,Glen Pridgen,5,If you are in the mood to laugh...then this is the show for you. It's good clean fun without the dirt of other comedies. My favorite new show of the season.
B00ESB6CV8,Just Another Page,5,Every single episode makes me laugh. I love Andy Samberg. I hope this show gets the attention it deserves and has a long life.
B00ESB6CV8,M. Kennedy,1,You just reminded me to cancel my instant video of this ridiculous show.  Sorry you couldn't find a better vehicle for Andre Braugher.
B00ESB6CV8,Rich Mahogany,5,Easily the best new comedy on tv and quickly becoming one of my favorite shows. It really reminds me of the first seasons of The Office but in a police station which sounds like a strange idea but it works perfect. The first season was great especially seeing Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) interact and become closer. Joe Lo Truglio is awesome as Boyle giving some truly hilarious lines throughout each episode as does Terry Crews who's basically playing himself it seems. Honestly the whole case is pretty amazing and everyone usually gets there time to shine. Definitely will be recommending this show to everyone.
B00ESB6CV8,Sproutsmom,5,This show is so funny and creative at the same time.  The diagologue is fast-paced and you will miss some zingers if you nod off.
B00ESB6GBY,Agnieszka Koszowska "MovieLOVER",5,this show is just hilarious!!! Neil Patrick is just beyond funny!! I love that show!I'm not sure if it's the last season but I'm enjoying it while I can:)
B00ESB6GBY,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I love this show but I love the decision to make the final season a run-up to Robin and Barney's wedding.
B00ESB6GBY,Anne Lee,4,How I Met Your Mother is in its 9th and probably last season but  continues to be a light-hearted fun show to watch. I don't consider it appropriate for children but a great combination of silly humor and true sentiment.
B00ESB6GBY,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",5,I enjoyed this final season and liked the way the writers completed the circle of the story of the relationships between the characters.  It has been very entertaining  mixing drama at times  with comedy and some real hilarious situational comedy.
B00ESB6GBY,B. Merrill,5,The show is a great comedy but I am very happy to see it come to a close. I think the writers should have wrapped it up in season 8. It really could have been great ending a year earlier with Ted meeting the mother much sooner. I think the long stretch irritated the viewers. The show is well worth watching to laugh but the material ended about a year ago.
B00ESB6GBY,Christopher R. Williams,5,This season is definitely feeling a little forced. but at the same time im not going to complain. it have to say i am not ready to say goodbye to the characters but hope they are able to leave the show on a good note and not just drive it into the ground.
B00ESB6GBY,Cynthia J. Sanborn "Charlie's girl",5,The actors are incredible and after 8seasons they are like friends of the family.  NealPatrick Harris is a favorite and I will watch anything he does.
B00ESB6GBY,Edgar,4,Funny show Neil Patrick herest is the king and Jason Segal are what makes this show so great boom layered!!!
B00ESB6GBY,Heather Hintz,3,Not as funny as the other seasons. Still funny and follows the theme but perhaps it's one too many seasons. I understand that it's difficult to write the shows. They did an excellent job overall.
B00ESB6GBY,Jordan Dunn,1,HIMYM should have ended their run around season 6. Once Marshall's dad died the season became too serious for it's own good and stopped being a comedy and tried to rely more heavily on the dramedy side of the show - they should have stuck to being more closely related to a sitcom than dramedy. It's a shame this show has been so disappointing because of the all-star cast at their disposal
B00ESB6GBY,K'ann Strohl,5,AWESOME END!! Enjoyed starting from season 1 and working my way to season 9. Only saw 3 from 9 due to cost. On a budget and just had to see the ending. Thanks for the free seasons I was able to view.
B00ESB6GBY,M Parker,5,This is one of my favorite TV shows and sometimes I just have to buy an episode to skip ahead a little.  It will be hard when this show ends.
B00ESB6GBY,Nicki,5,I love how the series is wrapping up this season. But I hate that the series is wrapping up. Seriously. What will I do without the HIMYM gang to make me laugh...?? Guess I'll just have to start all over again with season 1.
B00ESB6GBY,Ryan Pritchard "thor_oakenfelder",2,This last season was ridiculously bad. so disappointed that I actually paid for any of it. the last episodes were the worst.
B00ESB6GBY,smashbox24cr,5,I loooove the character of the mother and think the actor/character totally live up to the legend. Shes perfect.  The season slowed my interest slowed midseason but first and last episodes totally banging.
B00ESB6GBY,Tamara L Perez,4,It's good but sometimes I think it's a little too imoral for me.  And personally I think they dragged out this show too long.  It could have been finished in 7 or 8 seasons.  They threw in a few stupid shows like &#34;Weedend at Barney's&#34; to drag it our longer.  Get to the point!!  Thank goodness it's the last season and Tedd finally gets to meet the mother.
B00ESND9HQ,Bj,3,For some reason these guys are very likeable and their ladies are quality too.  Im very glad McGarrett's mother-character is gone:  horrible selfish person.  Likewise with Wofat whose involvement and personage was hideous.
B00ESND9HQ,B. Merrill,5,I love the show the setting is incredible Hawaii is one beautiful island and the whole show scans many beautiful places on the island. The show itself is right up there with any of the other cop detective drama's out there well worth watching. I think the interaction between Danny and Steve is more than amusing.
B00ESND9HQ,Dennis P. Blackwell,5,like it very much - better than original series although I liked it also.Hope it returns next year also.
B00ESND9HQ,JLH4,4,I own every season and I enjoy everyone one and yes just as any show it has it's good episode and bad one there was and is never really a slow period.  It is well written and the actors portray the characters very well.
B00ESND9HQ,North Texas Girl,5,This episode started out pretty normal and then ended up being a powerfully moving episode. This is a great TV show!
B00ESND9HQ,Riley Harper,5,I love this show it is great entertainment! And I love the characters maybe more than the original!! They are more &#34;human&#34; than the original show and they actually have personal lives!!!!! Love the show and can't say enough how much I look forward to watching it every week!
B00ESND9HQ,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I really like the show. I became a fan in the middle of Season 1 and am still a huge fan. I am really pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this show to anyone who is looking for something different to watch. Each episode keeps me on the edge of my seat and I find there are times I start laughing and can't stop. I would say this show has something for everyone. As I said I really like this show.
B00ESND9HQ,stoneyb,5,I love this show. The stars are great together. Love Alex O'loughlin as Steve McGarrett & Scott Caan as Danny Williams that partnership makes the show.  Like Daniel dae kim & Grace Park too. The shots of Hawaii are also the stars of the show. EXCELLENT show.
B00ESND9HQ,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",5,I IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORGINALLY HAWAII FIVE O AND I LIKED THE ORGINAL THIS IS A GREAT UPDATED ONE
B00ESNDG8I,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,Of course is GREAT as always!! So worth paying what you do here to view past and current stories!!  No hassel to view as it can be on those (free view sites).  The fee really is nominal!!  A great way to  catch up if you miss a time or two!!
B00ESNDG8I,Darlene Walker,5,I love this show it is very good and I love all of the seasons.  Actually I own every season and hope this show goes on and on!!!!
B00ESNDG8I,Marian,5,Didn't think it could get better... but Ted Danson and Elisabeth Shue... are such a great addition... They make this seem like a different show with the other same characters.. LOVE all the characters...
B00ESNDG8I,Nick,5,the tv show csi is one of my favorite shows to watch and i'm glad is now on season 14.
B00ESNDG8I,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I am a fan of CSI and I am really pleased with my purchase. I have bee watching CSI for a long time and it is one of my favorite shows. I have to say that the show has only gotten better. I love the story lines and the characters. The current season of CSI started with a shocker and it still keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.
B00ESNDHQY,ablatt123,5,Very suspenseful and would recommend this series to all my friends!!!  It keeps me chomping at the bit for more!!
B00ESNDHQY,Alera Red,5,You can never go wrong with NCIS.  If you like mystery with heartwarming and impressive characters then this is the show for you.
B00ESNDHQY,Amazon Customer,5,Loved this episode!  What a turn of events!
B00ESNDHQY,amrbilly,5,still miss Ziva but give a chance for Emily she really good what she does and I wouldn't mind have ziva and Emily together what do you think????
B00ESNDHQY,Christine Perez,5,Loving this show. It keeps getting better. It never gets old. I love the characters on the show. They all bring something to the make a success.
B00ESNDHQY,Country Girl "Country Girl",5,This show just keeps evolving and staying great!  The addition of Ellie Bishop as a cross-organizational NSA employee is brilliant.  She add the touch of goofiness and brilliance needed after the departure of Ziva.
B00ESNDHQY,Deborah Born,5,this is the best season yet. I love the new interaction and cannot wait to see how the characters develop
B00ESNDHQY,Dennis P. Blackwell,5,Excellent as always! This is a very well done series as evident by its lasting nature.  Not sure how much longer they will continue but I will watch as long as they keep putting them out.
B00ESNDHQY,gnlmiami,5,You would think that after 11 seasons this show would be stale by now. Not so. It's just as fresh as ever. I always enjoy spending an hour with this team each week. And I enjoy revisiting it by watching reruns during the summer.
B00ESNDHQY,hobbles,4,Not sure yet has been one of my favorite shows but it seems to be struggling to fill the void left by Ziva  I'm not sure if their just gonna keep filling in with guest appearances from people  we've  already seen or bring in someone new  Diane Neil would certainly be a nice permanent addition
B00ESNDHQY,Jim Morris "Jim Morris",5,NCIS is one of the greatest shows that's ever been on television. If you like cop drama this is the ultimate. I don't think any more needs to be said.
B00ESNDHQY,Joyce Gilliland,5,the only other show i ever watched as much was mash. this is a brilliant show with chemistry between all the characters that is hard to find in any other series of any kind.
B00ESNDHQY,Keith A. Hartshorn,5,Full of action.  Characters are easy to understand and plot is always outstanding.  Hope this show goes on for a long time
B00ESNDHQY,Kevin M. Utting,5,I have been a fan of NCIS since they started. I own the first 3 seasons on DVD and watch them every now and then. I keep up with each season and watch them regularly on Amazon each week. Looking forward to seeing how it goes this year with the rumors of this being the last season. Not sure if this is the last season for David or for the whole cast.
B00ESNDHQY,Laura Lezlie Rice,5,I'm a Vet and I love this show. I have watched this series since the beginning and I'm glad it is still with us.
B00ESNDHQY,pam,5,What else to say we have watched every season and really enjoy!  Don't know how much longer show will be on but has brought us a lot of good entertainment.
B00ESNDHQY,raten51,4,I love the show every episode is always exciting and full of action. I do however miss Zeva not being on the show any more.
B00ESNDHQY,Rextafier,5,This show is great the team makes it work. I hope they find another agent for Govbs and crew to make the team complete again.
B00ESNDHQY,Riley Harper,5,This show gets better and better. I hope that it stays good even with Ziva gone. I love Ziva and miss her character so much but am willing to give the new girl a chance. I had to give Ziva a chance and liked her more than I did Kate which I never thought was possible.
B00ESNDHQY,Robert W. Evans,5,I love every epasoide of NCIS  it is my favorite show
B00ESNDHQY,Ronda Pennycuff,5,NCIS is one of my favorite shows. The storylines are really good and interesting. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of shows like CSI. I really like this show. I am also looking forward to next week's episode where we get to meet the newest member of the cast and see how she works with the team.
B00ESNDHQY,Tumbleweed,5,Great as always. Didn't care about the Ziva bowing out sequence. Little bit psychobabble. But they have the best writers otherwise.
B00ESNDHQY,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",5,I LOVE ALL NCIS AND EVERY YEAR IT GETS BETTER I AM SORRY THAT ZIVA IS LEAVING BUT I LOVE THE SHOW STILL
B00ESNKDHA,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Lui and Aidan Quinn are amazing to watch. My husband is waiting for Sherlock and Watson to get together but I love how much they've grown as partners since the first season.
B00ESNKDHA,Amazon Customer,5,I absolutely love this show!  The chemisrty betwen these two main characters is amazing!  I love how Sherlock figures out the crimes.....and especially happy that Aidan Quinn is a major part of the cast!  So very happy this has been renewed for a second season because I am so addicted to the show!
B00ESNKDHA,Barbara Hartwell "Tiarasncrwns",4,I like the spin on the Holmes/Watson series - brought it up to date and made it acceptably contemporary. Yes I like it quite a bit
B00ESNKDHA,Boulder Mike,5,we have been watching the show since season 1..good acting - good storyline..one of the best crime shows currently out there...
B00ESNKDHA,Connie,5,I love watching the characters in this show develop as well as the story line which is both entertaining and fascinating.
B00ESNKDHA,David Lehmann,5,What if achieving this capability in seeing things is possible?  What if there are people who can be so good at manipulating events to suit their purpose.  Elementary makes you think about this- am I doing all I could to be good at what I do?  Maybe there are people who can see through my conclusions and help me see more.  good series.  Great actors.  Sometimes frustrating. We like that most episodes have a beginning and an end very few  &#34;to be continued&#34; soap opera stories.
B00ESNKDHA,David S. Cowan,4,Some of this season's story lines seemed a little weak but I still enjoy the characters and the character development in Holmes.  Joan Watson could actually be played by any actress other than Lucy Lu.  Her Character is by far the weakest in the show.  Johnny Lee Miller shines so bright he steals the show.  So even when the story is weak I still enjoy his portrayal of a modern Holmes...
B00ESNKDHA,David Whiting "NYCityfool",5,The first two episodes of season two were a bit weak but it seems the writers have found their footing and have bettered season 1.One of the very few viewable shows coming from the US.
B00ESNKDHA,Dennis Maloney,5,Elementary proves that you can have 2 modern day Sherlock Holmes shows on at the same time that are very different. I like the fish out of water aspect of Holmes being in New York and estranged from his family.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are an excellent double act.
B00ESNKDHA,Dennis P. Blackwell,5,well done series and the pairing is good.  I like the modern presentation and the interpretation of the original stories with the twists and turns.
B00ESNKDHA,Eileen J. Troemel "Dragonlady",5,I'm addicted to this show - I love the original books and have watched many movies based off the books.  This is a modern take on one of my favorite detectives.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.
B00ESNKDHA,Elvoyce Hooper "Elvoyce Hooper",5,Does not insult the viewer.  The incorporation of the up to date scientific information like the K2 boundary is brilliant.
B00ESNKDHA,henrietta zielinski,5,i see a lot of good chemistry here between the actors - not just the major two but the support and there is also this underlying humor that is clever and subtle.
B00ESNKDHA,JackShadow "Jack Shadow",5,In season two Elementary continues to produce interesting episodes built around the relationship between Watson and Holmes. That Watson's role could have so easily become a straight man to Holmes or a blossoming love relationship leaving the viewer waiting for the day they will get together and did not is a plus. Rather Holmes and Watson have working partnership and a respect for each other that keeps the episodes more interesting. The excellent Lucy Lu adds a real depth to Watson keeping the episodes from always revolving around Holmes exclusively. This show is on my Watch List.
B00ESNKDHA,Jane Leslie,5,I adore this show! The actor playing Sherlock is perfect and Lucy Liu is his perfect foil. I watch the BBC production as well and I am loath to say which one I like more.
B00ESNKDHA,Jean-Francois Gobin,5,Sherlock Holmes as he would have been if he were born in this century. Very good series and great stories.
B00ESNKDHA,Katmomma,5,Main characters work off each other beautifully.  Like watching a fine ballet.  Plots are well written.  Well directed.  Always looking forward to the next episode.
B00ESNKDHA,kevin m love,4,I have always been a big fan of Sherlock Holmes stories and while l don't others have reached Conan Doyle level the stories are interesting and both actors are exceptional playing Holmes and Watson.  I also enjoy the twist with Lucy Liu as Watson especially without a romance component.
B00ESNKDHA,K. Rodman "knamdor",5,I love the interaction between Sherlock and Watson.  I like the mysteries that they have every week.  I have totally missed them the last couple of weeks.
B00ESNKDHA,Leevora,5,I'm so glad this show has more positive reviews than negative ones because I love Lucy Lui.  I'm not too keen on the guys playing Sherlock but Lucy adds that sexy smart fun down to earth ora that I love seeing.  So yay for Lucy!
B00ESNKDHA,Linda A. Flora,5,The writing is great modern interpretation of the great Sherlock Holmes and Watson.  How quickly Watson is learning and how this works with her medicine training.
B00ESNKDHA,M. A. Griffin,5,This program continues to entertain and surprise.  The interaction between Holmes and Watson never gets old.  I like the introduction of the story line invo9lving Holmes brother.  What is he up to?  This is one program I look forward to watching each week..
B00ESNKDHA,Miss DIckens "Miss Dickens",5,Johnny Lee Miller excels in his interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in a modern day setting. The intelligent scripts give Lucy Liu the material to make a female version of Watson very credible.
B00ESNKDHA,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,Elementary is one of my favorite shows it is exciting and you are always gessing what is going to happen nexts. the video itself there was no problems what so ever. it played wonderful I would recommend this show to everyone.
B00ESNKDHA,M. Kennedy,5,I find myself looking up facts about topics mentioned and being fascinated with the all the things I'm learning.  Super plots and terrific actors.  Hope it lasts as long as the Closer and Burn Notice.
B00ESNKDHA,M. Skiles "r_vin",5,I really enjoy smart television and this show is smart.  It's well written and the characters are lovable.  I would definitely recommend!
B00ESNKDHA,NO CO Bear,5,My wife and I became Johnny Lee Miller fans while watching Eli Stone on Roku.  This show (Elementary) is giving him a great vehicle to showcase his acting talent.  I had not been a fan of Lucy Lieu because I had not seen her in anything where she was one of the main players but she is amazing in this series. The chemistry between them reminds me of Dave and Maddie in the old series Moonlighting (though MUCH more complex).  I HOPE they don't screw up a good thing here like those folks did.Aidan Quinn as Captain Thomas Gregson and Jon Michael Hill as Detective Marcus Bell are tremendous actors in their own right and their characters add much more to the series than just some side stories.
B00ESNKDHA,Ray L. Babcock "Brooks on Golf",5,I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan for many years but if you're expecting something that tracks with the old Holmes you won't get it.  Instead you'll get the Holmes' updated persona and cleverly twisting plots that takes deductive reasoning to new heights.  Solid mysteries with a 20th century twist.
B00ESNKDHA,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,This is another show with an original pairing of male and female detectives.  Has good character development.  Good follow through on old unsolved cases as well.  Holmes and Watson were well chosen and have just a little chemistry thrown in.  Highly Recommended!
B00ESNKDHA,Rextafier,5,This show is a great unwind-er to a day.  you can come home and relax with ease and watch elementary
B00ESNKDHA,Roy E. Oetting,5,No I really like this series. Paint it Black has a surprise ending which I didn't see coming. Sherlock's deductions in this episode were well thought out. This show has very good regular actors and the guests have been excellent too. I think Lucy Lui is an excellent actress. I would watch anything she is in. Lucy Lui did a fine job directing Paint it Black. Looking for more.
B00ESNKDHA,Saskia L. Cohick,5,Love this show! ! By far one of my favorites of the fall season.  Vastly different than other police procedural type shows mainly because of the personal relationships - and they have grown so much this season.  I can't wait for more episodes.  Only sad point is the looming holiday season means that schedules will get all discombubelated and make me angry I can't have my shows when they are supposed to be there.
B00ESNKDHA,Sheila R. Breck "Against the Grain",3,I haven't had a chance to watch all the episodes yet...but it is an interesting premise and plotline.  The stories are good and the actors do a good job.
B00ESNKDHA,S. Scarlett "Sam",4,Miller is a good Sherlock and for an hour-long show they do a good job on the intrigue.  I am on the fence about Watson&#8230;but give it a shot.
B00ESNKDHA,Susan K. Gushue "mathmom",5,Complicated characters. Weird criminals. Nicely written. I always look forward to it. I also like the way the show deals with addictions.
B00ESNKDHA,S. Warren,5,Was surprised with the first season.  A little disappointed in the arch villain.  Just down right boring and annoying.  An arch Villain should be remember not one that I want to forget about quickly.  The series itself is great.  Season 2 so far has made no exception.  Good show.  So far so good no Arch Villain.  Haven't gotten to whole season yet.
B00ESNKDHA,TGFan,5,The writing and acting of each episode gets better each time.  I am happy that the characters are not two dimensional and each is growing in their own fashion
B00ESNKDHA,The Currdog,5,Elementary just keeps on getting better and better as the series moves on and on into the shows successful future.
B00ESNKDHA,wylie maziol,5,I love this show even better now that they are exploring the back stories of the the main characters and the expanding on there friendship. Keep up the good work.
B00ESNKFXM,Anthony J Perri,5,Great stories...very appealing characters...great interplay between family dynamics and law enforcement careers...Tom Selleck holds the show together while Donnie Wahlberg always creates electricity
B00ESNKFXM,B. Merrill,5,Blue bloods is a great show. It is a show that has amazing family values despite the families issues in defending New York city from danger. A great police show but more importantly an amazing family story. The writers of this show have totally outdone themselves. I think every member of the cast in this program has made their best performance ever. I hope the writers don't ever run out of material because its a great program.
B00ESNKFXM,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,Well worth paying this small fee to stay current with story line here!!  Love the show anyway!!  Streamed very well too
B00ESNKFXM,Dave W,5,Tom Selleck keeps on going and going....and better than ever with great new additions to the cast.  More to come!
B00ESNKFXM,Dennis P. Blackwell,5,I ve liked this series from the beginning .  Timely topics and good acting make this a really good series .
B00ESNKFXM,Ellen H. Center,5,another one of my favorite shows and I love the family aspect that is used to solve these crimes.  I love the way all the actors who are family members interact with each other.  Good Job!!!
B00ESNKFXM,Evelyn M. Garner "whitehead",5,love watching bluebloods one of my favorite shows..such great story lines and great acting by the cast.hope they are on for many more seasons.
B00ESNKFXM,Judith E. Oakland,4,I really like this series and can't get enough of it.  I love the interaction of the family.  Donnie Wahlberg is absolutely fantastic; he is completely believable.
B00ESNKFXM,LOUISE,5,I love the actors especially  Tom Selleck. This show has class and always has a family moral to it.  I
B00ESNKFXM,Marian,5,Tom Selleck and the rest of the Family are Great tooo... Great entertainment... Hope this goes on tv for a long time... This is a good Irish Catholic family portrayal..
B00ESNKFXM,Mickey Rhode "Book enthusiast",5,I like the whole cast of characters but enjoyed Selleck the best. The story is wholesome and easy to follow.  They have a lot of idealized characters but with plenty of drama and a high level of morality.
B00ESNKFXM,Pamela Medina,5,This is a wonderful and addicting series.  It is worth your time & watch to see a family of law struggle to the right thing and yet be a family united.
B00ESNKFXM,Sandy J.,5,Always an interesting story line -- never boring.  All the characters are so different and so unique in their own way.  I love this show and would recommend it for anyone with similar taste.
B00ESNKFXM,Scott Newton,4,This was pretty good.
B00ESNKFXM,Southern belle "southern belle",5,May sound corny but I love the Walton-like feel of this show. It still has modern characters and plots but love the fact that all characters value integrity.
B00ESNKFXM,wanona thomas,5,From the beginning to the end of each show I truly can say tha each character is wonderful. It's a family that stays together and deal with everything that comes before them without no avail. I truly enjoy each season. Don't stop the show at all I love it.
B00ESWOCVO,Anthony J Perri,4,Very funny in the tradition of all in the family...characters need to grow for show to be great...but has potential to improve
B00ESWOCVO,B. Merrill,5,This show is hilarious. Typical everyday family issues. Great cast amazing how they all work so well in this type of show. Well worth watching it will make you laugh.
B00ESWOCVO,Carlos A. Hermida "Carlos",5,Great series. Very entertaining. A must see.
B00ESY5VR6,Donkey,1,This I thought was a dumb movie but if you like gory it is here! The quality of the movie was poor so when I reported it to Amazon they refunded my $3.99. Amazon is so good about this! The movie is about this Psychologist that invites her so called friends over to her house for dinner and she took movies of everyone to see if they really knew each other as well as they thought they did. Surprise! They didn't!But as I said before I could not follow it as it kept stopping and starting. Didn't think I would ever make it to the end because of that. Perhaps you will have a better experience.
B00ESY6CN8,chris,4,The show was okay. I have only seen one episode air on TV. Hope it was not canceled already. Lots of action and drama.
B00ETKEFQ2,Barbara A. Kephart,1,I tried to like it but this comedy is anything but funny.  I didn't even like the trailer but I happen to like everyone of the cast members.  I just don't understand why none of the cast members ever ad libbed something funny every so often.  It would have kept my interest.  I held out as long as I could but got to a point where I could no longer waste my time watching.
B00ETKEFQ2,B. Merrill,5,Seth is amazing this show will keep you in stiches. In my opinion it will last another season or two.
B00ETKEFQ2,David Asensio,3,I like it it's not as funny as i thought but it's still good it's one of those shows that will progress as it goes on and funnier episodes will follow
B00ETKEFQ2,William Hodges,5,This show keeps my wife laughing throughout the show. It is a bit crude but fun to watch. We have not missed a single episode.
B00ETKG8AI,ablatt123,5,Loved every minute of this series.  I would Highly recommend this to anyone.  I cant wait for the next one
B00ETKG8AI,anastasia,5,The chemistry between Tom Mison  (Ichabod Crane) and Nicole Beharie  (Lt. Abbie Mills) is unbeatable. Their chemistry is unmatched; it is what makes this show so great. Sleepy Hollow is a drama with some comedy sprinkled in. Anyone who watches this show will fall in love.
B00ETKG8AI,AzLou,5,Excellent new series. Love it. Great plots for every episode. Great special effect. Great acting. Keeps the viewer in suspense.
B00ETKG8AI,Boricua,1,No subtitles in spanish and english. Because of that i only give one star. But the video are in HD.
B00ETKG8AI,C. Van Blake,4,I'm from Upstate New Your and have driven through Sleep Hollow many times.  So naturally I grew up with the stories of Sleepy Hollow and Rip Van Winkle.  I found this interesting and a little creepy but I wouldn't say it is great. Fun but not addictive or riveting.
B00ETKG8AI,David Asensio,5,sleepy hollow has become one of my favorite show the story lines are well done and the new modern twist to this classic fairy tales brings it new life i would recommend this to anyone who like action/mysteries with a bit of the sifi thrown in you will be glad you did
B00ETKG8AI,D. Campbell,5,Love the direction this show takes you in. Combines history with biblical predictions. Fun to figure out where it will take you next. Great acting and I love the humor thrown in. To have our common everyday technology questioned is really funny. I hope to enjoy the twists and turns for many seasons.
B00ETKG8AI,Deborah Minyard,5,Good clean show that canmake me laugh and get involved in the suspense at the same time. Have even gone back to watch over certain shows.
B00ETKG8AI,E. Easley "EZ Truth",5,This looks to be very promising.  Looking forward to seeing more episodes.  Interesting take on the Sleepy Hollow story - very creative!
B00ETKG8AI,Gerard M. Walsh "book_rod",5,It's a new take on an old story. The acting and stories are equally fantastic. I happily recommend it to all.
B00ETKG8AI,J. Griffiths,2,My first question is how can Ichybod's police partner stand to have him in the same car with her. Ichybod (an intentional misspelling) is still wearing the same cloths that he was wearing when he crawled out of the hole he was buried in for over 200 years and he still looks just as dirty. I could go on but I think the other reviewers that gave it a low rating pretty well covers it.
B00ETKG8AI,K. Thomas,5,Love it! Great show. Great actors. Great special effects. Would recommend to a friend to watch. Wish you could buy them ahead of air time ...lol.
B00ETKG8AI,Octopusrex,2,Ichabod Crane wakes in modern day America to deal with the devil...Only once or twice does the main character question things to which he is exposed which would root an average person to the spot gazing in wonder. Does nothing to challenge the viewer to become empathetic with any the characters.Just doesn't do it for me. Piling on more bizarre villains and even less credible special effects makes this a serial video game for the less inquisitive mind. Poorly written and plotted.
B00ETKG8AI,Peggy Carey,4,Wish the series had more.  Left u wanting more.  Pretty good series though. I have watched it about 4 times.
B00ETKG8AI,Ray L. Babcock "Brooks on Golf",4,This is a program you'll want to see and I'm sure you'll enjoy.  This is a &#34;just-for-fun&#34; program that has fascinating plots that make the impossibly seem plausible.  I watch each episode at least twice.
B00ETKG8AI,TGFan,5,As it says I am waiting for the next season.  The way the actors make each line and each scene both dark and some how funny and scary makes me jump just a little.
B00ETKG8AI,Victoria R. Brown,5,This show is awesome.  I hope it is a hit with other  people.  Problem is when I like supernatural themed shows no one else seems to like them and they always get cancelled.  Tune in people -- it is great!!
B00ETKG8AI,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,5,I hope that the writers do not go off and make this series too crazy and unwatchable.  I really like the theme very much.
B00ETRANIO,Amazon Customer "Glenn",2,Loved New Girl Season 1 and 2. Season 3 really disappoints. The funny banter from the first two seasons seems forced and contrived this season. I'm having a hard time bringing myself to watch it.
B00ETRANIO,Barbara A. Kephart,4,The show started out great. It was mostly funny and loved all the characters.  This season though It seems like there is no clear direction. The comedy is not as funny as it was in previous seasons. I hope it gets better in upcoming episodes.
B00ETRANIO,G8rMom7 "Allison B.",5,I don't know why but I felt the need to purchase all these episodes because I can't stop watching them.  There is really no sitcom that I can watch over and over again like this one.  I basically have it as my background noise when I work...like it's music or something!  I love love love Nick Miller (Jake Johnson).  I'm a sucker for a good improv guy and he is just awesome.  This season has Nick and Jess together who are the best romantic couple since Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  I'm really looking forward to watching their relationship develop...even though it's obvious from way back in Season 1 that this would eventually happen.  Great show!
B00ETRANIO,Jennifer Anderson,5,I did not like this show too much when it first came out.  This has quickly changed after jumping in for Season 3.  So much that I had to go back and watch the first 2 seasons on Netflix because I couldn't settle with just 1 episode a week.
B00ETRANIO,KK,5,Best new comedy sitcom I've seen in yrs! So cute and funny and clever. I watch and rewatch every episode and still laugh out loud each time!
B00ETRANIO,Lynda Blocker,5,The writers for this show are beyond awesome.  Laugh till I hurt funny.  I try to watch this at lunch time so I can get thru the rest of the day in a good mood.
B00ETRANIO,smashbox24cr,1,Schmidt is disgusting. Jess is annoying. Nick is lame. No more new girl. Cancel it and mindy project too. Yuk.
B00ETRANIO,Sproutsmom,5,This is one of the best written and acted comedies on television.  I belly laugh at this show. Seriously - this is some funny stuff.
B00ETRANIO,zzdb,5,A new installment to a great show. Hasnt dipped in quality and laugh out loud humor since season 1 episode 1.
B00EUFOZ52,Runs with Scissors,3,This season we have once again dug up previous players only this time they threw in a family member as well.  The two worst decisions ever made by the producers of Survivor were when they brought back Jon Dalton in Survivor: Micronesia and if you watch the show you know how that went... and this season they brought back Colton Cumbie.  Really?  Well that went south quickly enough we weren't subjected to his whining for long.  So far I am not impressed with this season.
B00EUFOZ52,suzatm,4,The whole concept of the instant video is fantastic.  I don't like watching tv at night - I would rather read - but I do like some of the shows out there.  Season pass is great to be able to have the latest episode automatically sent to your account so you can watch it whenever you want to.  I originally was interested in this season because of Rupert coming back but now that he is no longer on there - I find I am hooked and look forward to the email saying the episode is ready to be downloaded.
B00EUME3DO,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",5,I love this show.  It's so amazing to see how the chefs treat the kids and how super talented they are.  Incredible.
B00EUME3DO,Cchea D. Nugent "musicgirl",5,Started watching this because my 11 year old in home economics was interested in it.  But I was so impressed with the skill level of this child chefs!!!  Amazing!!!  I'd like to see one of these kids in a Master Chef All-Stars against some adults!!!
B00EUME3DO,J Day,5,We love this show.  We would like to see the prize be college or culinary school funds.The kids are great!  It's nice to see the chefs work with the children vs. the adults.  Joe shows more of his soft side.We actually like this a bit better than the adults.
B00EUME3DO,John T Robinson,4,It was a real treat to watch these young kids create. Ramsey and his partners show a different side of themselves as they encourage these young chefs.
B00EY7L4QO,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",5,I love everything about this show.  Only wish I could be a Braverman!  Great on instant video and on tv.
B00EY7L4QO,Ellie,5,The acting is terrific and all so real.  Good and bad things happen just like in real life.  Good sense of humor thrown in and love all of the characters.  Have recommended this series to my family and friends.  I'm sure they will love it as much as I do.
B00EY7L4QO,john francis leonard,5,I usually watch this drama as it airs. But if I miss an episode I can always catch it on Amazon. It is so well written and the dialogue reads as real people speak naturally.
B00EY7L4QO,Judy Goldsmith "NYJazzgirl",5,I never want to miss an episode!Can't wait to find out where life is taking this family.The acting is good and the characters interesting.
B00EY7L4QO,RAM,5,I love this show and have watched it since season 1. It's very real to life and you can relate as a parent to each of them.
B00EY7L4QO,Ron Sowell,4,It's just that good!! They said I have to write 15 more words. Watch the whole series from season 1 to now on Amazon!
B00EY7L4QO,smashbox24cr,1,Loved the first four seasons cant stand season five. The actors seemed burned out on their roles. Not gonna watch more.
B00EY7LT9Q,ablatt123,5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SERIES!!  I cant wait for the next ones to come out.  Im chomping at the bit!
B00EY7LT9Q,Aimee,4,oh man!  love this series.  I have to admit to being a little worried that I wasn't appreciating this episode as much as I could since I haven't seen the new Thor yet.  But I found it so engaging!  I'm really getting into all the backstories.  The characters are starting to develop.  I still feel like something is missing though.  There's a depth to the show that I just don't see yet.  But the potential is there.  These actors could do a LOT more than they're given now.  I hope the writing turns up as the season progresses.  I feel like it's moving in the right direction and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.
B00EY7LT9Q,alfredofranco,5,I can't wait four the next episode.
B00EY7LT9Q,Amazon Customer,4,So far this is pretty good. I don't know how attached I am to any of the characters but I think they'll grow on me and the story lines have been interesting.
B00EY7LT9Q,Ariel Miller,4,I like to see how the alien elements are integrated into new technology and fun characters.  Each episode is always entertaining.
B00EY7LT9Q,Cathy Hinds,5,Love this show.  Can't wait for it to air.  My husband thinks its great too.  Some thing worth watching every week
B00EY7LT9Q,C. Pratt,5,Somebody really wanted this show to spell shield.  I've watched several episodes so far and it's a fun show.  I like the actors and the story thus far.  This series looks to be one follow-able for family viewing.
B00EY7LT9Q,C. Van Blake,4,I like this new series but expected more super heroes. This is more like a spy series where talented people do great stuff. The only one with real super powers so far ended up exploding. None the less it is entertaining and has pretty good story lines with unexpected turns in the plot. It will keep you coming back for more
B00EY7LT9Q,CW FISHER "stars for connie",4,This is a good TV series to follow up on the movies.  The plot and characters are good and the story line is very strong.  I do agree with one review that one of the episodes was a spoiler for the movie and I did not look at the episodes until after I saw the  movie Captain American Winter Soldier.The series is getting better with every episode and I hope it continues to get better.
B00EY7LT9Q,David Asensio,5,at first i didn't think it would be a good show but it is an awesome show i like the story lines they have done so far and the little hints here and there as they mentioned what happens in the new Captain America movie any for any Marvel fan out there and even if your not it's a good show to watch
B00EY7LT9Q,Elizabeth Bailey,5,Every episode was engaging.  The story lines were intriguing and left you wondering what would happen next.  The season was successful in that you will want to see what the next season will bring.
B00EY7LT9Q,eric,5,This is a nice sci fi dkash men in black deal I've seen highly interesting. Great hour of tv.look forward to seeing the next show
B00EY7LT9Q,GelSailing,1,this was so silly and predictable we quit watching it and are amazed anyone would like it...but we are adults
B00EY7LT9Q,gnlmiami,5,There was a slump after a few episodes but the show now seems to be on good footing. The tie-in with the Marvel movies are fun but it's best when it stands on its own.
B00EY7LT9Q,hobbles,4,I didn't think I would like this show but the story line is pretty good it stays pretty close to the movies
B00EY7LT9Q,JanR,4,A really fun show that is developing into terrific science fiction.  The actors are easy to invest in and the relationships are evolving as the plot thickens each week. Looking forward to Season 2.
B00EY7LT9Q,Jim,4,How do the non-marvels handle the Marvel Universe? Question answered! Just enough connection to the mainstream motion pictures while staying true to Kirby's and Lee's vision of human heroes and villains.
B00EY7LT9Q,jim,5,This is a good series that could have a big following and the action is good as is the storyline
B00EY7LT9Q,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",3,This is an ok series but it is missing something. It definitely does not have the same feel as the movie as far as story and direction. I think if it does not change I am afraid it will not make it past this season.
B00EY7LT9Q,Joe Groves "Joe",5,This show is da bomb! Love that they brought Colter back; just not sure HOW it was done? Cloning? Good group dynamic. Keep up the good work!
B00EY7LT9Q,Juan "Prince Moloch",4,Not too bad for its first foray into mainstream T.V although it took me sometime to warm up to it. I am looking forward to the next few seasons.
B00EY7LT9Q,JV,5,Please keep it coming love this show and looking forward to seeing more and more of it love the cast they are all great.
B00EY7LT9Q,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,This show is a great show if you like all of the other marvel movies.  Otherwise you wouldn't really get it.
B00EY7LT9Q,MARK J. LONG "Martok",5,Marvel has so much material from all there years of comic books. It's great to see these shows on TV. The series is pretty good so far!
B00EY7LT9Q,Michael "KarateMike",5,GREAT SHOW LOTS OF ACTION WITH PLENTY OF PLOT TWISTS TO KEEP YOU HOOKED ALL CONNECTED TO RECENT BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES (AVENGERS THOR ECT) CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON TWO
B00EY7LT9Q,Peter Mancini,5,Quite a bit of character development happens in the first 6 episodes and may turn some people off. However later on the show really catches fire. Well worth sticking around for the entire season.
B00EY7LT9Q,Randall von Schoeler "Garden Guru",5,The show is great.  I would like to see it more often.  Seems like they go weeks in between sometimes on the air dates.
B00EY7LT9Q,RhymeWriter,3,It's witty. It's semi interesting. But it's slow and predictable. But it's Marvel. The fanatics among us are going to like it way more than it deserves.
B00EY7LT9Q,R. McCuistian,5,This is one of the most original and well-written TV shows I've seen in years.  Hope for many more seasons!
B00EY7LT9Q,Rugby,3,Its good but not yet great. I like the premise and see lots of room for it to get great especially if they bring in Thor and weave all the marvel story lines together but right now its playing to small. Too much build up for small revelations. The plots are formulaic. The actors are all very appealing and doing a good job so i will keep watching and hope the writing gets better.
B00EY7LT9Q,Saskia L. Cohick,5,Love it.  I'm totally into the super hero movies and love the twists and turns.  There is always something going on you don't know about until the next episode.  And fully enjoy the parallel story lines to the Marvel movies.
B00EY7LT9Q,Sentinus,5,ABC and Marvel have developed a strong show capable of both standing on its own and complementing Marvel movies. Each episode has developed the characters and it is obvious the actors actually have a passion for the material.  Clark Gregg and Ming-na Wen are consistently great. You also don't need to be into superheroes to enjoy the show. It is a strong and well done action-spy drama that brings cinematic quality to the small screen and gets better each episode.
B00EY7LT9Q,Seth C. Howard "pops",5,we enjoy comics brought  to life
B00EY7LT9Q,TGFan,5,This is great I keep getting caught off guard and it forces me to pay more attention.  Just when you think you have a character figured out smack they twist and your left with how great the writers are at making the show feel so good.
B00EY7LT9Q,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",4,I LOVE  THE MOVIES  SO WHEN IT CAME OUT IN THE IN TV I WAS EXCITED TO WATCH IT. I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPPOINTED BUT STILL GREAT SHOWS
B00EY7LTJG,Amy S. Hayley,4,FINALLY a new spin on all these tiresome police shows that are completely unrealistic and just plain awful!!  This one has great potential!!
B00EY7LTJG,L. M. Keefer,5,Loved Blair Underwood in this edgy updated version of Ironside.  Wish they hadn't cancelled the season after only a few shows.  Really enjoyed his character and his team.
B00EY7LTJG,Riley Harper,5,I enjoyed this show a lot and am so very disappointed that it was canceled after 4 episodes. What about the rest of the episodes that won't air? How to we see those? Gotta say I'm sick of tv shows being canceled before they have a chance and other tv shows staying on for years that totally suck. No it wasn't the original Ironside but I think that was the point! I really liked it!
B00EY7LTJG,Robert J. Quigley "specs",4,Just wish I knew what night it was on otherwise I would be a regular watcher.  Different than Raymond Burr's take but different is good.
B00EY7LTJG,V. Durost,2,I suppose that remakes are necessary when writers have nothing better to do. They should have left this one alone!
B00EY7LTJG,wanona thomas,5,What happen to my show You only gave me a some piece and now it gone are you going to put it back on the are. I really would like to knowthis is for the network to answer
B00EY7Y8VC,Al Mellon,5,wife missed a show so we bought the season for her to re-watch.  It is nice to have this option
B00EY7Y8VC,Anthony J Perri,4,Strong stories with appealing characters...continues with great action scenes...fascinating use of modern fire technology and always interesting twists keep occurring
B00EY7Y8VC,Calley Wenzel,5,I think that Dawson and Casey are meant for each other and I like the emergency call scenes. Thank you.
B00EY7Y8VC,Deborah Jones,5,This show has made me realize what our fire dept. does for us. It has a good story line and very interesting characters.
B00EY7Y8VC,Evelyn,5,Like the parlay between various characters.  The action is very stimulating and keeps your interest.  Hope this show keeps on going.
B00EY7Y8VC,gitaday "Gitaday",5,I will watch Jesse Spencer and Taylor Kinney in anything.  I wasn't sure what their chemistry would be together but they have made &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; into a most loved new show for me.  The whole cast is wonderful and each character has their own storyline weaved beautifully into a modern day firehouse and all that happens on and off the job.  I haven't met anyone who watches weekly who doesn't love it.
B00EY7Y8VC,June,5,I love the show. It is an  excitingly mastered script. I hope it continues for a long time. The writers never let it get dull.
B00EY7Y8VC,JW-169,5,Another great television fire series I like the cast and I think acting is great. I think it's better than rescue Me. And I also like the way the show combines with Chicago PD. I hope that they get a number of seasons out of this one.
B00EY7Y8VC,k9krzy,5,Realistic situations - you start to &#34;love&#34; the quirks of each character.So happy to see a solid dramatic series on TV
B00EY7Y8VC,M. Kennedy,5,Parallel plots make this an engaging show to watch.  Gives one a great deal of respect for those who risk their own safety on the public's behalf.
B00EY7Y8VC,MM,5,Just over all great stories and characters. True to life and adventure. Looking forward to next season. Check it out.
B00EY7Y8VC,Paula Jankowski,4,Story is okwatch it every time it is onMy tv lets me tape anything and as much as I want so I do not miss my shows
B00EY7Y8VC,Penny Abernathy,5,The characters are well drawn.  Great acting.  The fire and rescue scenes are very realistic and sometimes gut wrenching.  Intense.
B00EY7Y8VC,RAM,5,This is a show I never get tired of watching. It has a great storyline with plenty of twists and turns. You fall in love with the characters and you look forward to the next episode!
B00EY7Y8VC,t2tigger,5,I fell in love with this show immediately.  I had missed several shows so it was great to have access to the entire season on Amazon.
B00EY7Y8VC,Vico96,5,Every week keeps getting better and it was already great to begin with!! Hate that the show ends each week...can't wait til the next show!!
B00EY7Y8VC,wanona thomas,5,It's getting better and better than the last season. Keep it coming. But I'm at little mad that my captain is leaving.
B00EY7YGBO,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,As always great!!  This is the perfect way to watch what I have missed for a small fee.  Just to stay current on this program.
B00EY7YGBO,Patricia Wollweber,5,Love this show.  Can't get enough of it.  I want Olivia and Nick to get together.  Still wish Stabler was on it but it still an excellent show even without him.  Love all the crime and drama.
B00EY7YGBO,Randall C. Wiggins,5,This has always been a favorite series and remains so even in it's 15th season. Lots of loves and laughs.
B00EY7YGBO,wanona thomas,5,I'm always been in love with this show from the beginning and even more now. I love the way the twist and turns that make the show more interesting to watch. I thank the writers for the vision that given to you. Keep it coming
B00EY89MWG,Dentish,3,Ron Swanson is the real star of this show. Amy Poehler is relentless in promoting her left wing agenda whenever possible. The show is getting tired.  Give Ron his own show !
B00EY89MWG,Mal,5,Who doesn't love humor? If you don't then go away and be a sourpuss alone. The rest of us will be laughing our butts off.
B00EY89MWG,Redbanks,5,Sharp doesn't describe the wit and humor.  I know actors are leaving the show but I hope this one goes on for a long time...
B00EY8MCOQ,amrbilly,5,i alway love the show and it just a great story line and it alway something new and never got bored with this show!
B00EY8MCOQ,Amy,5,Each season of Bones just gets better and better. Can't wait to see what the writers come up with in the next seasons of the show.
B00EY8MCOQ,B. Merrill,5,Bones is a great show very entertaining and a multitude of different relationships going on throughout the show. It is a very entertaining weekly drama with a nice back story to it. It shares circumstances that have happen over the prior seasons. A great show to watch. The first few minutes tend to be kind of graphic so I suggest not watching while eating.
B00EY8MCOQ,Calley Wenzel,5,It is one of the best seasons so far and I would recommend it to everyone I know. Thank you.
B00EY8MCOQ,Christine Perez,5,Started watching this season and I sm hook. What s great show. I love all the characters. They are all funny.
B00EY8MCOQ,David Lehmann,5,We like that there is a complete story in each episode versus the soap opera approach. There is continuity of the situation- relationships etc. but the crime has a beginning and a solution.  The technology may be bit in the future for some of the modeling but it is fascinating and the range of roles and situations are intriguing. the personalities keep you interested.
B00EY8MCOQ,GA girl,5,Loving this show!!!!  This show has not gotten boring or played out. I enjoy every show and season nine is just as good as season one.
B00EY8MCOQ,happy,5,I really enjoy the interaction of the characters in this show. So much I wanted to purchase this series to enjoy much later like Sunday movie day!
B00EY8MCOQ,James D. Tate "tate manor",5,The only two television shows that I watch religiously are DWTS and Bones.  The plots are always imaginatively written with attention holding drama and enough humor thrown in to keep the characters interesting.  The cast has become like an extended family.  The writers' have created the nine or so assistants to Brennan with the same depth as the other characters.  I would like to see more of Caroline Julian and my favorite assistant &#34;squint&#34; is Abernathy Finn.  Dr. Sweet's needs a love interest; someone to challenge his never ending character analysis.  I would like to see Hodgins retrieve his fortune in a unusual and challenging method with a bit of humor added and not happen in just one episode; over 3-4 episodes for the intrigue aspect.
B00EY8MCOQ,JANE EYRE,5,I LOVE BOOTH AND BRENNAN.  I love the changes Dr. Brennan has gone through in her demeanor since the first season and yet she still remains essentially herself. I mean just look at the last episode. lol
B00EY8MCOQ,jessie barkley,5,a great balancing of 'plot' solving and character relationship interactions.... i watch  bones.... major crimes.... and ncis.....  plus a couple of home shows......
B00EY8MCOQ,J. Gwin "Jules",5,Bones Season 9Fox .. Absolutely love love this show. Very happy it was renewed for a tenth season and that it's coming back to Monday Night.
B00EY8MCOQ,Keith A. Hartshorn,5,I have watched this series since it started.  I love it.  The interaction between the characters make one wish that they were working with the characters in the series every day.
B00EY8MCOQ,Kindle Customer "knitting hobby",5,Last good program on on fox. I love it when smart people use there brain to solve problems the characters all relate well to each other and there are interesting twist and turns to the plot. However it appears that Christine has disappeared from the program as well as the baby had by Angela and hodgins.
B00EY8MCOQ,Marian,5,Love AIL the Characters and watching Brennen grow... emotionally...can't wait for the Wedding... Bones and the rest make it a complete show...Again love all the characters.
B00EY8MCOQ,mary ruth,5,We have watched from the beginning and it is worth going to and starting at the beginning! Very interesting cast and you have to love Brennan and Booth are super together!
B00EY8MCOQ,MeMary77,5,This is a great series &#34;who-done-it&#34; that combines the FBI working in conjunction with forensic anthropologists to figure out how a murder happens each episode.  It also mixes in the private lives of several of the FBI and anthropologists which is very entertaining.  This is another series I am completely hooked on.  Give this series a try; you will love it!
B00EY8MCOQ,rcowgirl,5,This show has made a great transition from the leads dancing around being a couple and actually being a couple. Booth and Bones are a couple that has problems and I like that about this show. Most shows get the couple together and then they are happy and never have problems. I enjoy that they are together and are trying to navigate there relationship like a normal couple that fights and loves.
B00EY8MCOQ,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,This show is also consistently entertaining.  Each week revolves around a different murder that Bones (Temperence Brennen-the forensic antropologist) and the FBI agent Booth.  Bones has a very different & tactless personality which Booth tames.  These two were finaly married in Season 9.  So there is a strange pairing of the two at the center of the story.  Highly recommended!
B00EY8MCOQ,Robin Hood "California bookaholic",5,I love wherre this series has been going. Having them together has not diminished the fun or excitement of the episodes at all. This should be the best season yet--I am so looking forward to the next episodes! Toni and Roxie were always my favorite undercover characters and having them back for Episode 2 promises to be classic Bones and Booth repartee! And the wedding coming up should be a total delight--we've been waiting almost 9 years for this moment. I know it will be an episode I watch over and over!
B00EY8MCOQ,Roy E. Oetting,5,This was a neat first show with it's little twists and suspense. I'm also glad about the the Booth/Bones relationship and I'll say no more as it would be a spoiler. Good show and I'm looking forward to the rest of season 9. I see Pulant (sp) sticking his ugly little head up in one of the next two episodes. I sleep a lot so before I know it I'll be watching episode 2.
B00EY8MCOQ,Sally Ruse,5,I like watching bones it is a great program. I have watch every season and can not wait till the ten season .
B00EY8MCOQ,Suja,5,This is a great show; love the science behind the investigations; the whole team at the Jeffersonian and in particular the chemistry and conversations between Booth and Brennan....An intelligently written series..
B00EY8MCOQ,Susie "galaxygirl",5,They have managed to keep the story fresh and moving and the bonds between the characters have grown and developed so there is a real time line here.  I have all the seasons and current episodes and this is where I go when I need to lose myself in a story for a  little while.
B00EY8MCOQ,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",5,IF YOU LIKE MYSTERY AND MURDER AND SCIENCE THEN THIS IS FOR YOU IT IS GREAT SHOW TO WATCH BUT NOT WHEN YOUR EATING
B00EY8MCOQ,woody,5,a very good action show with out all the cussing silly sex that has nothing to do with the show
B00EYY6JHG,Robert Gammon,4,The plot had a good twist that was not revealed until the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Well executed.
B00EZJMKCI,Mitchell Malcolm,5,I've loved this show since season 1.  Now with the addition of the other out of town member introduced.  Can't wait to see what this season brings!
B00EZJUDFE,Christopher R. Williams,5,This show may just be the best show ever!!this season it does feel like the gang is running out of show ideas a bit but it is still funny as hell. i have to say i would be totally willing to watch this show way past its prime :-) lol
B00EZJUDFE,Happy Guy,5,And weirder. Yeah some stuff feels sort of acted but as a viewer since the first season it's amazing how far the characters have fallen in 9 seasons. Still worth watching.
B00EZJUDFE,Jeff,5,This show never disappoints me. My favorite episode so far is &#34;the gang tries to win an award&#34;. Best non-animated comedy series ever.
B00EZJUPWA,Amy,5,Love the show. Interesting take on Ghost Hunting. Love how they are not just investigating the Mine but how they are trying to find the initial cause of the haunting.  Love the miners personalities.
B00EZJUPWA,Candy Cane "Is it just me?",2,Season 1 was a lot more action packed and there was a great deal more evidence.  This season has become a real yawner.  Three shows were done around an EVP in Chinese.  Then they tarted looking for evidence in outlying areas...apparently nothing of real import happening in the mine?  Too bad.  It was so promising in the first season.
B00EZJUPWA,Cheryl Wilson "centmolady",5,I suppose the simplicity of it draws my attention.  I for one would never have thought to investigate in a mine shaft although I am sure many lives were lost there.Good show and genuine folks.
B00EZJUPWA,Katherine Young,5,Far better than you would think. Very fun plot twists and a fun cast to watch. Keep on digging boys!
B00EZJUPWA,RedRonin,5,Still love the second season although it appeared over produced.  You begin sensing a camera crew not represented on film.But never the less this still rocked!
B00EZJUPWA,Sheila R. Breck "Against the Grain",1,I enjoyed it till I figured out it was all faked.....the plot would be very interesting and compelling if it were true.  Money down the drain.
B00EZJUPWA,tigger,4,i would really like to go there and see the place. I think the history involved is very interesting and glad for all the research being done. This is  great story.
B00F0CLD5E,James F. MacLean,5,Freda was a pleasant surprise. I thought a knew all about the Beatles. I guess not. Most of the movie was during their early years with their manager Eppy. I also learned a lot about Liverpool and the cavern during their early years. This movie was worth watching.
B00F0CLD5E,Neal "MerlinFL",5,No idea who this woman was or is as she's still alive and well and still doing secretarial work.  Just a very interesting story of one woman who was the one and only secretary the Beatles ever had which George Harrison mentions in one of those Beatles Christmas fan appreciation recordings they used to produce back in the early days.
B00F0CLD5E,PJ,5,A new perspective on the most documented band in the world. Freda showed a lot of integrity in not capitalizing from her story all these years. A charming documentary from one of the few people who experienced Beatlemania from the inside.
B00F0CLHQO,Dwight,2,very committed to the storyline but ultimately a big disbelief - did MK ULTRA take over or something?No mother would be okay with this happening to their son.
B00F0O6YEW,Amazon Customer,4,I like it.  But I am hoping that season 3 get's us off into a new concept.  This could happen since a lot of people whose acting seemed insincere or ridiculous got snuffed.
B00F0O6YEW,AmazonFan,5,I don't have TV and with my schedule I have to watch shows at a time that is convenient for me---I am soooo happy amazon.com has Homeland Season 2 and of course the Final of BreakingBad....I wouldn't be able to see it otherwise! Thanks amazon.com!!!
B00F0O6YEW,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",5,I actually like season 2 better than season 3.  The quality seems to be decreasing as it gets further along.  This season is excellent though.  Highly recommend.
B00F0O6YEW,D. Walters "Florida Boy",5,Interesting and a decent script with good acting. I can watch it commercial free and when I feel like it.
B00F0O6YEW,Emily H. Leonard "catsmother",5,One of the best written shows on TV. Great dialogue makes for great characters whose believability makes some of the fantastic plot  lines credible.
B00F0O6YEW,Lisa,4,Very good- see this one
B00F0O6YEW,nocnotes2day,5,I thought I would enjoy this show because I am a huge Claire Danes fan.  I didn't know I would be thinking of it between shows and hardly able to wait for the next episode!  Love that it exploits the idea we have all expected about politics and our government....TRUST NO ONE!  at least in politics and gmt. lol
B00F0O6YEW,OWEN R. MILLER,5,Very well written and excellent cast. Have already recommended to all our friends. Just wish it was available without charge to members.
B00F0O6YEW,Palavering,5,This series will keep you on edge episode after episode.  It's won several awards and will win more in the coming seasons.  This is entertainment at its best!
B00F0O6YEW,Teddy and Me "JLEE",5,Season 2 just as good as Season 1.....can't wait for Season 3.Highly recommend this series.Here are 4 more words.
B00F0O6YEW,The OC,5,So many good things in Season 2 as in Season 1.  Great writing and relevant to our times.  Superb acting.  Suspenseful.  Clare Danes is perfect for the part and ably supported by the rest of the cast.  All good things come to an end so I am enjoying it while it's here.
B00F0O6YEW,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,5,This show is so addicting.  It's one of those shows that you can't wait to see what happens next and when the season ends you pray there's another.
B00F0SWPSC,D. M. She,5,This is a very fun movie.  The actors were great and there was some creative filming.  I'm beginning to think that the low budget films are WAY better than the CGI big bill features.
B00F0SWPSC,Hiram Davis "HongryHawg",2,I purchased this strictly on the reviews. I dig camp and looked forward to a few yuks. What I got was lame and stupid.
B00F0SWPSC,seetheartsoftly,5,love it funny and movie is good nicely kept like new dvd thanks gohasting for keeping your dvd well kept and your movies are great
B00F0SWPSC,Tab,5,JUST HAD TO GET THIS MOVIE. WATCHED IT IMMEDIATELY AND LOVED IT. I THINK IT WAS BETTER THAN SNAKES ON THE PLANE
B00F0XPJH6,Abigail "Abby",5,05/17/2014LOVE THIS SHOW...CANNOT WAIT TIL IT COMES BACK ON.IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER!!!  WAS HE NOT ON THEMOVIE &#34;STARGATE&#34;?  I AM WATCHING IT NOW.PLEASE DO NOT WAIT TOOOO LONG TO COME BACK ON LIKE ALLTHE OTHER SHOWS ARE DOING....WE ALL WILL WAIT...
B00F0XPJH6,Amanda,5,The Blacklist is one of the best shows I have seen in a while. James Spader is excellent. Definately recommend
B00F0XPJH6,AMason,5,Can't get enough of this tv show!!!! Hooked from the pilot and every episode since!!! Can't wait to see what happens next!!! LOVE that amazon had it available too....such a time saver!
B00F0XPJH6,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,James Spader is at the center of this interesting story about a man who comes forward with a list of names of people who need to be captured by law enforcement for various wrong doing.The one condition he has is that he requests that only one particular agent takes on his cases..As the series progresses we meet various villains who prove to be at times great challenges to reach and to capture.By the end of the first season one is left with the distinct impression that the agent requested might be the protagonists daughter. The mystery continues into season two despite some denials from the protagonist that the agent is not his daughter.  Although sometimes dark and sometimes violent there are moments of pathos and humor to balance out the series and makes for  good tv!
B00F0XPJH6,Annette Delaney,5,Friends have been talking about this show but I just started on Season One and am hooked!  James Spader is excellent as always- he plays the bad guy so well!  A must see if you like suspense and cop shows.
B00F0XPJH6,barbw,5,I don't know how the rest of the shows will play out but the pilot was excellent and intriguing.  The acting was excellent and it is the best pilot for any new TV show I have seen so far.  I will enjoy watching more but I will be willing to watch on Amazon to avoid the annoying and awful commercials of regular TV shows.
B00F0XPJH6,B. Merrill,5,I love James Spader he is hilarious and plays an incredible part in this tv series. This show so far has captured different content to capture my interest. I look forward to season 2 I think this show is going to be a hit for many years. I love James Spader's humor he is great in this drama and still very entertaining with his sense of humor.
B00F0XPJH6,Calley Wenzel,5,I love it. It has a lot of action and drama in it. I would recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks
B00F0XPJH6,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,so so  so so woweeee good wowowow wow wow good i love it but i cant say how much i love it
B00F0XPJH6,cindy gooch,5,This show is super intense! I love it. In some ways it is a typical FBI type show but it has a drama twist that makes it unique.
B00F0XPJH6,Cocorah,5,The story line is great. The series is very enjoyable.  The two leading actors are excellent at portraying their characters.
B00F0XPJH6,Dark Maiden,5,This is the best series out today. On the intelligence level of Leverage. I like shows that don't treat me like I'm some mindless drone and challenge me with plots and intrigue.  I hope it gets many years to run.
B00F0XPJH6,Denn,5,Great show great acting
B00F0XPJH6,Devora,5,OMG SPADER rocks glad he is back. This is a good show and I hope it is picked uo and the stories continue to shine.
B00F0XPJH6,Dina Blythe,4,I recommend the show. The plots and subplots are suspenseful and James Spader's caracter is loads of fun to watch.....
B00F0XPJH6,D. Smith "Global Nomad",5,This season is full of action and adventure. Loved it! Just when your thought you knew where the show was going it changed directions and went into a shocking spin. James Spader rocks his character.... Try it....
B00F0XPJH6,Eman,4,The season is great and it gets better as you continue to watch. The things that you think are obvious forshadowings are deceptive.It's worth watching.
B00F0XPJH6,Grover D Carson,5,I just love the action and just can't wait for the next series each week. I just hope the series doesn't with no clear cut ending like most series do. Never to be seen again!
B00F0XPJH6,Harry,4,This is a very good show. This is probably going to be around for quite a while. There aren't alot of shows that my wife and I both like but this is one of them.
B00F0XPJH6,hobbles,5,James Spader is good no matter what he does and so far this has been pretty interesting. It's worth giving a look
B00F0XPJH6,Jenny,5,I love this show. It is well written and the actors are great.
B00F0XPJH6,Jim,5,The story of the tv show is interesting and it makes you want to find out every detail there is. This is going to be a very good hit tv show and I am looking forward to new episodes....
B00F0XPJH6,J. Meehan "Naomi",5,This show rocks!!!!! I put it up there with my other favorite show - Scandal. Riveting! Keeps you wanting more! I hope this airs for a long time.
B00F0XPJH6,John Cayton "Karuna",3,This show has good stories but bad production in the sense that it demands one suspend to much of ones rational mind.
B00F0XPJH6,John D. Sens,1,This series so far is nothing but exhibitions of gratuitous violence coupled with the machinations of an evil genius played by James Spader who week after week knows everything.  It all lacks any credibility.
B00F0XPJH6,John Himmelein "Homesteader",5,interesting story with engaging sub plots and very good acting. fun to watch and look forward to the next episode.
B00F0XPJH6,Katmomma,5,Each episode deserves 5 stars on it's own merit.  James Spader is wickedly perfect as the lead character.  Looking forward to more.
B00F0XPJH6,Ken Humphreys,5,I wondered where 007 got his training!  This guy mades Bond look like professor Clueso.  Should run at least ten seasons.
B00F0XPJH6,K. Thomas,5,Great show...Never know quite where it is going ...you have an idea...but you don't know how he is going to twist it to his advantage or why the connection ...or who knows what.
B00F0XPJH6,Lauri Mannikko,5,I was told of this series and watched a network episode. That one got me hooked so I am better off now with the whole season. The episodes are better if watched in sequence.
B00F0XPJH6,Lawman,5,Awesome show great plot great actions. Good story hope there are many more episodes to come. Lol juju hhh July
B00F0XPJH6,Linda Saxton,5,Very good and suspenseful ... Red is so cool and calm nothing seems to bother him ... Very good show.
B00F0XPJH6,Lisa,5,I am SO hooked! James Spader is so under-rated! He is more mysterious yet convincing in every episode. The whole cast is truly my favorite and every week I am waiting anxiously for the next episode. I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!
B00F0XPJH6,mary ruth,5,After Boston Legal we missed James Spader and here he is one of the most intriguing characters in literature or the media. The entire cast is well chosen - very well done!!!
B00F0XPJH6,mgp,3,James Spader rises way above the stories and the rest of the cast. He is someone special to watch.But episodes count on violence rather than good story-telling.
B00F0XPJH6,Michael B.,5,I have found this series to be addictive to watch. I bought a TV pass which makes the episodes a lot cheaper. Because of the internet speed that we have in my area I went for the SD over the HD which shows up just as good on my HD TV.
B00F0XPJH6,Michael "KarateMike",5,GREAT CFARACTERS GREAT PLOTS GREAT SUBPLOTS THE BREAK OUT SHOW OF THE SEASON I LOVE IT ....IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER
B00F0XPJH6,michele symonette,5,I quit enjoy blacklist and look forward to every episode.  Both the acting and writing are excellent with new twists and turns constantly keeping you guessing.
B00F0XPJH6,M. Kennedy,5,Keep waiting for clues as to all the unknown factors in this show and &#34;Red&#34; is an intriguing character along with Lizzie's husband.
B00F0XPJH6,Monica A. Sloan,4,But hard to watch.  Sometimes better not to delve too deeply into such matters as terrorism.  But the drama and acting I found excellent.
B00F0XPJH6,ORURO H.S.,2,Some episodes are better than others. The acting is quite good...Spader the best... and there is suspense but not a single character really grabs me. Unlike The Shield and Justified I could stop watching it and not feel cheated.
B00F0XPJH6,Page 2,4,This can be a good story I would like to see more before I make up my mind. The actors were interesting. Story line was just good enough to want to see more.
B00F0XPJH6,Pamela,5,I love this show. I love James Spader's roll in this Tv series.. Best show right now on TV along with Person of Interest..
B00F0XPJH6,Pat Choate,5,This is an arresting concept and Spader et all are at the top of their form.  Hope this show runs for years.
B00F0XPJH6,Randy Ruhlman,5,Hope it has a long future.AlAll players are awsume.Were has James Spader been hiding?Looking forward to the next season.
B00F0XPJH6,Ray L. Babcock "Brooks on Golf",5,The acting is superb and the plots are intriguing and realistic.  This is an excellent program and I highly endorse it.
B00F0XPJH6,Rene',5,I love James Spader and The Blacklist is the perfect vehicle for him.  This show is entertaining and yes disturbing and keeps you guessing what's next for Red.
B00F0XPJH6,Ronald W. Pramshcufer,5,You are not going to be reading a book and watching Blacklist at the same time and think you are going to understand anything that's going on. Its a fairly simple core plot but it's the plot twists that make this one of the most original shows Ive seen in years. Buy the series.. don't  rent it... you are going to want to watch it more then once.
B00F0XPJH6,Southern belle "southern belle",5,James Spader delivers as always.  Lots of twists and turns and you never quite know who is good and who is bad.  Love this show
B00F0XPJH6,South Pole Cat "SP Cat",5,I came across this show by chance on Amazon.I am glad I did! It is like a mix of X-files (w/o the aliens) & Alcatraz . Highly recommended
B00F0XPJH6,S. Warren,5,The show pulls me into the story.  Especially the story of the villain.  Why does he do the things he does.  What is it he is after.  And will the FBI figure it out hehe.
B00F0XPJH6,Terrance L. Mcgowan,5,I have been a fan of James Spader since &#34;Boston Legal&#34;.  The episodes can be bizarre and bloody at times so I wouldn't recommend the series for the faint hearted.  It keeps you wondering about the relationship between the two main characters.
B00F0XPJH6,TGFan,5,I am very happy that the writers have not just caved in and wrapped up everything in a nice little box each week.  The acting is getting better as you see them switch emotions in the middle of a scene to complete the overall arc.
B00F0XPJH6,TJC,4,James Spader is having a great time so it is easy to enjoy the ride with him. Great fun to watch.
B00F0XPJH6,Tumbleweed,5,I hope they continue this. It is unique. The actors seem realistic and the plots are believable. Very good series.
B00F0XPJH6,V. Durost,5,My first encounter with James Spader was in Stargate and loved him.  What a pretentious villon he is in Blacklist.  I look forward to next season very much.
B00F0XPJH6,William J. Meegan "Never let another do for y...,5,The concept behind this series is really innovating and I am glad to see film makers coming up with new ideas rather than rehashing the same old - same old.
B00F2C1RPS,catthief,5,The Brits really know how to do it.  Please keep them coming.  The show was smart.  I get so tired of watching shows that are made for 12 year olds.  This show and all of the British TV I have watched knows we are adults.
B00F2C1RPS,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",5,I like historical drama that take place in England.  I always learn something new.  I would recommend this drama if you like that time in history.
B00F2C1RPS,djr311,4,Little slow for me but who doesn't like Benedict C.  Easy on eyes and great actor.  Loved the story line.
B00F2C1RPS,Doug Lowe,4,I have only seen two episodes. Very good so far. I'll reserve the 5th star until I am finished with the series.
B00F2C1RPS,Dr. in Pasadena,5,Tom Stoppard as the writer with this amazing cast is breathtaking and brilliant! Anyone who enjoys style pieces will fall in love with this HBO/BBC miniseries.
B00F2C1RPS,Jane Garmon,4,Any movie starring Cumberbatch is going to be good. He is a superb actor and I especially enjoy the British/European setting. I look forward to further viewing.
B00F2C1RPS,J. N. McCarthy,3,Good acting but the storyline is a bit confusing. I usually enjoy these period pieces but this one was a little off the mark. Scenery was your typical English lush countryside which is wonderful to watch. This wasn't one of my favorite BBC productions but it is still deserving of a view.
B00F2C1RPS,jo ann lovett,5,Loved the romance and drama too. Love movies from way back in 1900&#34;s.  Make more!  Put more on Prime too.
B00F2C1RPS,John T Robinson,1,Story line is slow developing and the use of period English slang makes some of the dialog difficult to follow. I gave up after the first episode.
B00F2C1RPS,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,This was a very good show I would have not have watched if not for Amazon Prime.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00F2C1RPS,Liz Hart,5,Oh I really like this. Spent most of last night watching it. There are some characters I love to hate on here. I'm an anglophile and I've almost exhausted all my avenues. I would recommend this for people who love period pieces.
B00F2C1RPS,Lucy Mcoosie "OleetaJ.Hays",5,I was left wanting more. Cumberbatch is an incredible actor. I felt he wasn't  appropriately  challenged by this roll. I can't wait to see his next project .
B00F2C1RPS,Martha S. Clark,3,Slow moving and very hard to understand what was being said.
B00F2C1RPS,Maureen A. Boehm "avid reader",3,This series is a disappointment. Painfully slow-moving and artificial. Cannot compete with Downton Abbey
B00F2C1RPS,M. Mara,5,It is wonderful to see Ford Maddox Ford's work given the respect and notice it deserves. The acting in this miniseries is amazing and heartbreaking.
B00F2CE91W,Amy English,4,I loved that all of the originals were back in Lima! I've missed them! Their voices have all improved and I'm enjoying the story lines.
B00F2CE91W,Brad Lovett Cohen "claymate26",5,This was the episode about the death of Finn and Cory. it was so well done. But sad. We will forever remember Cory. RIP.
B00F2CE91W,Calley Wenzel,5,It has a lot of teenage drama and really good songs. If anyone likes that I would recommend it too. Thanks
B00F2CE91W,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",4,Finn kind of pulled the whole series together and he is missed a lot. However the singing and song selections are still good. I am hoping that moving most of the action to New York will add the spark that is needed. So I will be watching for awhile longer...
B00F2CE91W,Lisa,5,the grief of losing corey comes across in all the episodes which are more emotional then ever. but the singing and messages are also better then ever
B00F2CE91W,Randall C. Wiggins,1,I love Glee but this was the WORST EPISODE EVER! The entire 5th season is terrible with very few exceptions.
B00F2CE91W,Tagsmom,4,This is the  season where they say goodbye to Finn (so sad) but then it picks up where season 4 left off! I like the original cast better but the show is still worth watching.
B00F2CE91W,Valerie Tucker,5,Wow!  It is like Glee got even better.  Mixing the old with the new regarding cast and songs.  Humor runs rampant and yet there are touching dear moments.  I love that they managed to keep it exciting.  You get it on your iPad immediately!  I had a glee festival!
B00F2CESXG,ablatt123,5,I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT!!  I cant wit for the next week for the next one.  Am always chomping at the bit!
B00F2CESXG,Avril Sol,5,Lovely new show! The book it's based on is now on my reading list. I hope the show gets renewed.
B00F2CESXG,beth holman,2,I fell sleep watching it. Hope for fans it turns out better other shows.its not for young people over the age of 17.
B00F2CESXG,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",3,Witches of East End is a Promising series that could take off by building suspense  for the protagonist  in discovering the life of witches.
B00F2CESXG,David Asensio,5,For those into paranormal romance this one got it all i think it's a good show to watch what not to love
B00F2CESXG,DJ,4,I didn't think this one would be too good but I decided to give it a try. Overall it's a pretty good show - has some funny stuff and a pretty good plot line. Good entertainment!
B00F2CESXG,Epiphany,4,Hello... I like this series. I wish that Amazon would notify the status of these shows if they are going to be discontinued... so I can go look for it on Vudu or Netflix.P.S. ALWAYS check on Netflix or Hulu before buying on Amazon... a lot of the shows are free and available there already.
B00F2CESXG,Heather Hintz,2,Acting not so great. Story line cheesy. The coven is awesome. Not engaging enough for me. Not my style. Sorry
B00F2CESXG,Heather Scott,5,I HOPE they bring back another season I have been waiting EAGERLY to watch more from this Tv show which is rare that I find one i enjoy that much! Please make it happen! watch and review so we can watch more!
B00F2CESXG,icewoman63,5,Better than charmed more story to it .makes you wonder.good job I hope you keep it up this would be a good drama to keep watching thanks
B00F2CESXG,jay,4,Good show kind of reminded me of the cross between charmed and Sabrina the teenage witch .They were great shows also .
B00F2CESXG,Jdances "bdancer",5,Love the special FX; story line; actors; music; and theme of the show.  Was curious if it was a Canadian crew? I highly recommend this show to those of you into Grimm; Once Upon and shows like that.  It is more adult but not too racy.
B00F2CESXG,Mike suell,5,Awesome awesome show
B00F2CESXG,pepper1031,5,I love this show. I needed to catch up before the next season started and I'm glad I had acess to it on here.
B00F2CESXG,Prefl96,5,I stumbled upon Witches of East End show by accident. Can't wait for more new episodes to come available. Hope there is a 2nd season.
B00F2CESXG,Robert J. Quigley "specs",1,A very murky and convoluted show filled with things nothing but darkness.  Uh-huh.  I am done finished with this!!!!!!!! BYE
B00F2CYVG0,Heather Hintz,4,I am not disappointed at all. I enjoyed. This season.  Especially the thanks giving episode. Omg the episode where bob is the substitute is adorable
B00F2CYVG0,Rebecca,5,We love that this show is still hilarious without pushing so many controversial topics. We always get a kick out of watching this show and relating to the characters.
B00F2CYVG0,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,I put up with the ads hoping they would go away. They did't so I'm done with Fox shows until they are gone.
B00F2PH3F8,B. Merrill,5,A typical Jewish family in the eighties hilarious show with great characters everyone in the show is hilarious. Its one of my first choices to watch it will make you laugh and if you grew up in the eighties you will appreciate the humor.
B00F2PH3F8,chris,5,This show is a knee slapper. Takes me back to yester year. I have actually worn clothes like in the show. I hope this show continues for years to come.
B00F2PHIGC,Anthony J Perri,1,I like Michael J Fox but  the show's characters don't come across as appealing...characters need to develop depth  and pace needs to slow...less slapstick
B00F2PHIGC,B. Merrill,3,The show is somewhat entertaining nothing that will make you laugh for hours. But if you need something to watch while eating its entertaining.
B00F2PHIGC,Mark E,5,This show has been refreshing to watch. Seeing Michael J. Fox back in a leading role is very good and the family cast is excellent. The pacing and comedic timing are spot-on and the laughs just keep on coming.
B00F2PHIGC,S. Wallace,5,Michael J. Fox is back and "YEA!" I say.  He's handling his medical problems with good humor and you will enjoy very much his new show.
B00F34YH5C,Aimee,5,I would really like to buy season 2 on instant video but the standard version says it isn't available.  I LOVE this show! But HATE that I can't access it. Please fix the problem!  I can't watch HD on my computer.  It isn't compatible.  Thanks amazon.
B00F34YH5C,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",4,I've loved her since she was in the office.  This is a hilarious show.  Great sitcom.  Awesome characters.  I've seen every episode and could easily watch them all over again.
B00F34YH5C,KK,5,Her character is a dr version of her Kelly Kapor role on the Office.  The other actors are hilarious and their interactions are amazing. LOVE LOVE!  If u missed the first sea in? Just buy it or don't but definitely start watching!
B00F34YH5C,LLB52,5,We had bad weather and missed this episode and I could not miss one.  I'm so glad this show was renewed.
B00F38ELNG,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,This series never fails to surprise me with how funny he can be. I completely understand why it's consistently one of the top rated shows!
B00F38ELNG,AllMyShelties "AllMyShelties",5,The only show that I constantly laugh out loud while watching. Wonderful characters and original stories. I have never watched an episode that I wasn't absolutely thrilled with.
B00F38ELNG,Ariel Miller,5,This comedy series takes the cake as far as laugh factor.  I'm pretty picky with comedy but this had me in stitches every episode.
B00F38ELNG,B. Merrill,5,I truly do not believe that I will ever get sick of or bored with this show. Nothing much changes in it from show to show but it is hilarious. This is a show where the characters are so entertaining nothing much has to happen you just laugh at all of their weird idiosyncrasies.
B00F38ELNG,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",5,I've seen every episode of the big bang theory maybe 100 times.  It's still funny.  Season 7 is a great one.
B00F38ELNG,Cami=) "Cami=)",5,I love this show! And this season has not dissapointed!!! True it is running a bit slower than other seasons but it looks like they are still deciding on a way to go......
B00F38ELNG,Christopher R. Williams,3,This show seems to be falling prey to the same fate of most shows in its position. they become an unrealistic success and then just start phoning it in.lately the show seems to focus less on intellectual based toilet humor and more on relationships and half assed jokes that they put something science sounding in.I think the writers and actors need to re watch the previous seasons and compare it to this one because i never thought i could get bored of a show i love so much so fast.
B00F38ELNG,Customer,1,I don't know why this show is getting such good reviews it isn't even the slightest bit funny. And the characters are annoying and horrible at acting. like I said this series is just extremely overrated.
B00F38ELNG,C. Westberg "chrishaddockaholic",5,Still manages to be funny and clever after all this time. I enjoy the writing and the skill of the actors in making the characters all their own.
B00F38ELNG,David Asensio,5,Is hilarious it makes me laugh out loud and is my favorite tv show on tv you can forget all your troubles for the text half hour i always look forward to the next episode
B00F38ELNG,Faye Hollidaye "Faye",5,I love this show - it's so funny! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch the newer episodes again and again whenever I want. I highly recommend if you enjoy laughing.
B00F38ELNG,G. Montour "GEM",5,Missed an episode a while back and that is not acceptable in our house. So I bought this to get caught up. Great as always.
B00F38ELNG,Howard Roberson,5,One of our favorite tv shows. But we miss it ofted and so the DVDs help us catch up on the ones we miss.
B00F38ELNG,Jeanne Lorance,5,This group has more than the average amount of issues.  Really funny issues but issues non the less.  One of the more entertaining series on TV
B00F38ELNG,Lois,5,I really enjoy big bang theory and can not wait for the season to come out. When I have a bad day I can put the Big bang Theory on and I am laughing again....
B00F38ELNG,loudyeller,5,Hey these are my guys and gals.  I have learned so much from this show.  Have laughed so hard as the tears streamed down my face.  Sheldon and Emmy's ...award after award.  It says it all.
B00F38ELNG,Lynne A. James "Lynne",5,I enjoy everything about this series. The personalities and the spot on witticisms are extremely enjoyable to me. I have come to feel like the characters are my buddies.
B00F38ELNG,M. A. Griffin,4,After a number of years the show stills draws my interest.  The addition of new characters and bigger roles for other characters has kept the show fresh enough to continue to make it a hit.
B00F38ELNG,M. Engel,5,Very funny dorky and educational.I just love it !! It has sexy and romance and science !!just fun !
B00F38ELNG,M. Kennedy,5,Still one of my favorite shows and thank goodness CBS hasn't cancelled it.  Seems like other shows I liked on CBS are gone or just gone to the dogs.
B00F38ELNG,Rebussmile,4,This show has a couple of years to go no matter what. Sheldonneeds to start becoming aware that his bullying is hurting himselfas much as those around him. Just a little growth and the showdeserves 5stars again.
B00F38ELNG,R. Hartley "Writer's Mind",5,This is one of my favorite shows. I laugh from beginning to end in almost every episode. The character interactions are just hilariou.
B00F38ELNG,Tamara L Perez,4,Season 1 to 5 would have gotten 5 STARS!Season 6 and 7 I don't know maybe the writters are running out of good ideas.  It's still good don't get me wrong I just thought it was even better in the beginning.  My favorite episode was when Penny hurt herself in the bathroom and Lenord was away and so Sheldon had to help her and how crazy Sheldon was when he took her to the hospital.  LOL
B00F38ELNG,The1and0nly,1,I hear everyone says this show is the best show ever. Sorry but that belongs too the wire which is the greatest show ever made. It had more drama than this. The whole alien thing creeped me out as well. Guess nothing can compare too the wire....
B00F38ELNG,Woody,5,My wife is a big fan of the series and was happy to add this to her library. She likes having he quality DVD's handy to watch anytime she wants. The sound and picture clarity is very nice. She also was happy to get seasons 6 too....
B00F3JT77U,B. Merrill,2,I watch it when nothing else is on. I would rate it with Michael J fox show and Crazy Ones it will make you laugh but its not amazing like The Millers or Modern Family those shows are way entertaining. The show is basically about a gay dude in his early 40's that has a daughter it shows the his relationship with his mother and co workers. Its marginally funny.
B00F3JT77U,Flannel Quilter,5,Love Sean Hayes.  His comic timing is great and he and Linda Lavin are well suited to play the overbearing Mom and son dynamic.  I have decided to buy the season pass.
B00F3JT77U,Riley Harper,4,I like this show so far. I think Linda Lavin as Sean's mother is the BEST choice for a tv mom I've seen in a long time. Sean Hayes was one of my favorites in Will & Grace and I do enjoy this show and watch it almost every week. It's a cute show and it does make me laugh.
B00F3KFFPM,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,Obsessed with this show. I didn't get into this show until the third season but now I'm obsessed with it and it's characters and the way we learn a little more about them every now and then.
B00F3KFFPM,a reader,5,The show has true character development and multiple story lines wandering through the current close focus.  The characters have a chemistry with each other hard to beat.  Must say I have truly enjoyed the first 2 seasons and find this one just as gripping.  Great show - you will love it !
B00F3KFFPM,B. Merrill,5,I love the weekly challenge to save someone new. I love how the cast gets along they are great. Nice drama with great a great cast. Nice to watch from the beginning season 1 because the show has a great story line with amazing backlash of the whole casts previous lives and who they intertwine with them to todays happenings.
B00F3KFFPM,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",5,This series reminds me of la femme nikita with a computer playing Operations.Both series used spy  assassins only la femme nikita was an international organization and person of interest isexCIA.. I think the writing in person of person of interest has slightly more interesting scripts.
B00F3KFFPM,Dave W,5,Great job making her a regular on this series...and should help with new and exciting plot twists in this innovative show.
B00F3KFFPM,D. Campbell,5,This series just keeps getting better and better. So intense with the machine's influence on the world just growing more each day. Your never quite sure if Root can be trusted even when the machine communicates with her.. Can the machine be trusted? What is going on? It just keeps you watching to find out episode after episode.
B00F3KFFPM,Dennis F. Elwell,5,I totally recommend this program to everyone. There something for everyone. It is completely entertaining. Maybe someday day they will make a movie.
B00F3KFFPM,Eileen J. Troemel "Dragonlady",5,The relationships - as odd and disfunctional as the characters are - in this show are wonderful to watch how they play out.  The plots are unique and interesting.  It keeps my interest every week
B00F3KFFPM,Keats,5,This show is amazing. Clever story. Brilliant characters. There is no better way to put this other than you must watch it. Just give it a try and you'll fall in love with it.
B00F3KFFPM,Kent C Christen,5,This is a chilling premise that is only intensified by what we are learning every day about electronic snooping going on in our society today.  The characters are real and one is drawn to them.  Both my wife and I really look forward to the next episode each week.
B00F3KFFPM,Leon J. Lee,5,I was glued to the TV until I saw every episode in the series. We'll worth the time and money
B00F3KFFPM,Marian,5,This show has me coming back for more.... All The characters are GREAT... I love the addition of Shaw too.. She adds humor even if she isn't supposed to be funny....
B00F3KFFPM,MWOO,5,I think the story line is excellent and keeps your interest with all the modern technologies thrown in.  I love the cast of characters.  I will not be happy if the kill of any of them.It's fast paced and thought provoking.
B00F3KFFPM,Page 2,5,This is the best series I have seen in a long time. Everyone I know likes it. I hope you will continue with this series. The characters are very real and I can identify with the story. Griping
B00F3KFFPM,Paula Jankowski,5,It is my favorite show list I would be very said to not see it.Would like to see more of Jim Caviezel
B00F3KFFPM,Randi Houts,5,though serious theme in serieswell developed charactersinteresting story lineslike the fact that each season they surprise me with new twists to the characters development
B00F3KFFPM,Ruffus McGee,5,This show is my fav. I can't believe they killed off who they did. Blew my mind. Hope it runs for many seasons.
B00F3KFFPM,S. Grady,5,The show continues to be amazing...even with the sudden character changes that occur it maintains the excellent status. I am looking forward to seeing the next season.
B00F3KFFPM,sharron reader "SPEED READER",5,THIS IS A GREAT SHOW AND WORTH EVERY PENNY TO WATCH! VERY EXCITING AND ENJOYABLE! SO PURCHASE WITH CONFIDENCE. GOOD PICTURE AND SOUND TRACK . NO PROBLEMS WITH THE ENTIRE SEASON I PURCHASED
B00F3KFFPM,Striker69,5,Best season yet. Everything just came together that had been set. HR and all the other organizations came into play. Person of Interest season 3 kicks it up a whole other notch with each new episode on display. Not sure where season 4 will go. But Season 3 is one heck of a ride and will never slow.
B00F3KFFPM,TDias,5,This is my favorite show. I love the characters -- especially Shaw!!!! (though Reese remains my fave and Carter is decidedly more kickass this season). Can hardly wait to see what happens with HR! Love it!
B00F3KFFPM,Tim,5,I never paid attention to this show until I caught the last episode of last season.  So I got on Amazon and watched them all.  Can't get away from it.
B00F3KFFPM,william barnes,5,This show just keeps getting better.I look forward to watching the show on Amazon for 1.99 and NO commercials.its the only way to watch my favorite shows.
B00F3KFI4U,Anthony J Perri,2,A bit of let down after a great first season....in some ways becoming too much like Lost and seems to have bogged down in Texas...if it is too survive it needs to recapture the spirit of last year
B00F3KFI4U,Anubis,5,This show was great and wish it was never cancelled although these TV networks just don't give shows a chance these days.
B00F3KFI4U,A. White,3,&#8230; but season 2 is losing it.  The show tried to mix things up by putting more emphasis on some characters and less on others this season.  The change in dynamic isn't working as well for me.  I still love the concept though.
B00F3KFI4U,Borat's Bad Brother,4,No season 3 coming! Once again America hates good sci-fi! We just can't stand to wait for a story to develop over time and take the time to learn about the characters we love. Well - some of us love them anyway. All of American tv is about to look like the "Lifetime" channel.If I were going to make a science fiction show now I would go straight to Netflix and see what kind of deal I could get because OTA tv is the place where quality sci-fi/shows goes to die.I'm still P!ssed off about SGU. Grrrrrrrrrrrr....
B00F3KFI4U,Deborah B.,4,It does really streeeeetch the limits of logic I just go with the flow and enjoy the ride.  Nice lark.
B00F3KFI4U,Deborah Minyard,5,Great show! One of those shows I look forward to finding out what will happen next. Please don't end this show!
B00F3KFI4U,gerry d lay,5,Love this show . Billy Burke is great! Love the characters and story lines. Easy to get attached to the characters. I hope they keep it going they are really getting to some interesting stuff
B00F3KFI4U,goldenbear5,4,This has been  a fun series to watch with lots of twists and turns. You'll learn to love and hate many of the characters and just when you think you hate some you begin to love them. You'll have to watch the entire series in order to see what I mean. Some aspects of this story are just the way I pictured the end of days
B00F3KFI4U,Kathy Miller,5,I work at nights so I bought the Season One and Season Two to catch up and will watch it again.
B00F3KFI4U,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",4,Season 2 has had some twists some reasonable enough but seems to be scattered in there directions from the trip to New Vegas to the issue of washington to cuba needs more direction but still worth watching
B00F3KFI4U,Paula K,5,Absolutely love this show. Be warned almost every episode ends with a cliffhanger that keeps you watching &#34;just one more episode&#34;
B00F3KFI4U,Terrianne Neill,5,I love this series and my whole family and I enjoy viewing it together! It is really good and I highly recommend it!
B00F3KFI4U,woody,5,not a lot cussing and a lot of action it is also good work on the plot and the video is clear and looks real
B00F3KL23Q,chris,5,Love this series. Always keeps you guessing as the plot thickens. Amazing how many people are involved with this great conspiracy.  Hope they have a second season.
B00F3KL23Q,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,excellent as always.  is good to ad to my video library and would totally suggest to others i would speak with
B00F3KL23Q,k9krzy,5,Great premise - great cast - lots of unanswered questions as to why he is wanting to kill the President
B00F3KL23Q,Southern belle "southern belle",4,Enjoyable show but not too believable.  I suppose it is not supposed to be.  Good plot but you gotta know that those people are tired of a terrorist living in their house.
B00F3W9NQ2,ablatt123,5,ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS SERIES!!  I would HIGHLY HIGHLEY recommend it to EVERYONE!  It keeps me wanting more and more! Love it
B00F3W9NQ2,Amazon Customer,5,I've loved this series since its inception.  Keep it coming!  Ian Somerhalter is gorgeous and Nina Dobrev is proving to be an accomplished actress!
B00F3W9NQ2,Amazon Customer,5,I was hooked in the first season.  Love the characters history and interactions.  As well as the supernatural beings and interpretations of the different worlds possible
B00F3W9NQ2,AzLou,5,Great episode! This is a magnificent series which has received a great deal of acclaim. I missed this episode and therefore had to purchase it and see it in order to keep up.
B00F3W9NQ2,Big Mama "Kathy",5,One of the best season finales ever...Can't wait for the next season to start!!!
B00F3W9NQ2,Brendan Ferraro "ferraro38",5,It is one of my favorite shows I think it's really good graphics really good outstanding I think it that it should keep going and keep all the same actors
B00F3W9NQ2,briana tarango "Briana Tarango",5,The story line was different and from the first half I was happy that it was Damon and Elena turn and Mr. Whitmore doing experiments on vampires was weird. For the mid season finale I can't believe that Damon broke up with Elena well I hope that they get back to together soon.
B00F3W9NQ2,Christie N. Daniels,5,This is a great season!  I am half way through it at this point.  The characters have changed a lot since season one and you absolutely must start at the beginning.  I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself feeling differently about a lot of characters after watching season 5.
B00F3W9NQ2,Cory,5,I love all of the Vampire Diaries! And would highly recommend it to anyone especially if they love romance and conflicts! :) It'll keep you in the front of your seat wanting more!
B00F3W9NQ2,Crystal M. "CM",5,They keep finding someone new to bring into the picture.  It keeps it interesting. I just hope it doesn't end.
B00F3W9NQ2,Customer,1,The vampire diaries is one of the worst television shows ever made. Don't waste your money on this crappy tv show.
B00F3W9NQ2,E. Best,5,Great show with twists and turns and emotional ups and downs !  Don't start watching if you don't have time because you'll be hooked.
B00F3W9NQ2,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,This show just gets better and better!! I'm so excited about Silas being in the picture this season and with all the plot twists with Katherine being human.
B00F3W9NQ2,Melody Garcia "tattoomama",5,Love this show with all my heart! It's a romance without being mushy and horror all rolled into one story! The quality of the downloads is great!
B00F3W9NQ2,Miss Amanda Marie,5,Great show
B00F3W9NQ2,Monaghan "ReMo",5,Totally addicting so far.  The characters and the plot linea so far is returning more the their &#34;glory day&#34; ways which will make any fan enjoy every single minute of it
B00F3W9NQ2,movieaddict,5,I can not get too much into this episode (major spoilers) but let's just say the ending will leave  you with your mouth opened in shock!
B00F3W9NQ2,Paula Jankowski,5,Love everyone and am sad that Nina cant love both brothersIt is alsmost impossible to chooseI would choose Stefin
B00F3W9NQ2,Scmeemaw "Scmeemaw",5,Can't believe it is in it's fifth season already. Enjoy the drama and suspense. I am glad they brought Jeremy and Bonnie back to life. The spin on the double doppelg&auml;nger was a bit much though.
B00F3W9NQ2,S. Heath,5,I really like the Vampire Diaries series (books and tv).  I can not wait for more episodes. I really like that there is more Damon in the TV series.
B00F3W9NQ2,T. Brady "Tom",4,There has  not been one episode that I have not liked about this series.  I get so in to the whole show that I wish it would go on for two hours.  This is a smash hit with me and until they take it off the air it will continue that way.
B00F3W9NQ2,Triciatx,5,I like the Vampire Diaries alot but it is an acquired taste. As the seasons have progressed the story line if kind of dragging along.
B00F3W9NQ2,Vickie Staton "Quickvick",5,Each season gets better and better; the special effects are great!  Great show; like the actors and how the show keeps fresh!
B00F3WB7FM,Barbara G. Michonski,5,This is a great show....even though I come from a  generation growing up in the sixties and seventies where bikers were not the norm. The story is really good even though there is some violence.
B00F3WB7FM,biker boy 66 "biker boy",5,This show just keeps getting better for each season. I love it. You never know what to expect. Things change so quick it keeps you interested and waiting for the next episode. Very good acting by all characters. It has to be  the most action packed TV show ever.
B00F3WB7FM,carolG,5,No Happy ending..Good job pulling storylines together. Left me wondering where the story will lead to next season looking forward to it
B00F3WB7FM,Charles Daniel Christopher,5,Jax and the MC are under greater pressure than ever as everyone's plots interfere with one another leading to what will surely be a truly cataclysmic disaster.
B00F3WB7FM,Charles Van Cleef,2,by season six this has become the silliest series that I have ever seen. Not worth the money and I regret buying it. I know that this is a personal preference and others might disagree but the writers apparently ran out of things to  get the actors to do. It just became stupid. I would skip this season and have fond memories of seasons one through five.
B00F3WB7FM,cherylannemarie,5,5 Stars what else can I say?!!  Love the show -- it is quite intense at times---but Jax makes it All worth it!!
B00F3WB7FM,Christie N. Daniels,5,This show never stops blowing my mind.  I love it but you must start at season 1!!  If you are squeamish beware!
B00F3WB7FM,Christine,2,This used to be my favorite program.  Now it's become a soap opera mostly centering around the female characters.  I actually got up and brushed my teeth during episode 9.  Borrrrring.
B00F3WB7FM,Christopher R. Williams,4,season 6 is still pretty strong. most of these high drama series just start getting stupid by season 6. and although i feel SOA may be going the same way they are definitely surprising me with fresh stuff.
B00F3WB7FM,CMZ Art,5,I accidentally bought the HD version and didn't notice any difference in quality from the standard version. Love this series and glad to be able to purchase it without having to wait for the next season to begin.
B00F3WB7FM,Deb,5,We have really enjoyed watching this TV series. I get disappointed with the spoilers on face book.  Just not right to do that.
B00F3WB7FM,Dustin Boyd,5,Love this show for years. Great content for mature audiences that really gets into your psyche a little and hits all the emotions for a well done drama.
B00F3WB7FM,Edgar,5,This show is incredible and this episode is intense it will have you hooked can't wait to see what happens next.
B00F3WB7FM,edith banes,5,This season is definitely on a roll.  Lots of twists and turns. Lots of questions to be answered.  Jax is becoming more and more like Clay.  It's going to be a very dark season.
B00F3WB7FM,Eleanor Weber,4,Good show but because of two other great shows I had to differentiate. Because breaking bad and BroadChurch so good.
B00F3WB7FM,ezrismommi,4,The title says it all. Straw. We see where each character has to make decisions because they are at the end of their rope. Some are subtle others are shocking. Cannot wait to see how this season pans out!
B00F3WB7FM,forex review,2,Watched the SOA sense the beginning and the first episode this season was like a race to be disturbing and plain sick.  No plot completely void of good writing and simple disappointing.  It was almost as bad as a porn flick.  Ironic and you'll understand if you buy it.  How did I unsubscribe to the weekly purchase?  Kill this series FX and go find something worth watching.  Sorry any real lover of SOA that is a critic of good drama has to agree this years opener went over like a turd in a punch bowl.
B00F3WB7FM,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,I'm so excited to see where Jax is taking the club and Kurt Sutter is always working to amaze the audience.
B00F3WB7FM,George D. Tomes "George Tomes D.C.",5,The guy from Beauty and Beast and the actress from Love and marriage make a great team. Jacks reminds me of a you godfather.What a great show! I cannot wait till next season. It is great to have all seasons available.Dr George Tomes
B00F3WB7FM,Hanamaru "Hana",5,the series has a complex storyline great characters good acting addictive fast moving why does amazon require such long reviews
B00F3WB7FM,icewoman63,5,One of the best shows i've ever seen. Im in love with all the acters curt Sutter your awsome OMG don't stop! !!!!
B00F3WB7FM,Janet C. Walker,4,This show is about various killers and people you don't want to know or touch with a ten foot pole.  Horrifyingly fun to watch though.  Like something from another planet. Everybody needs killing.
B00F3WB7FM,Jared,5,This show is great but it is getting old.  It is so mis mashed right over and over crisis after crisis.  It had its appeal in the first 5 seasons but it falls apart when the original Pres of the MC Club goes to jail.  It is alright but not the best.  Wait for it to be on sale or on prime.
B00F3WB7FM,Jay Kenney "James J Kenney",5,Love the SOA music. Can't get enough of it. Lover of all gene. Never knew Katy and Simm's had such beautiful voices.
B00F3WB7FM,jeff,5,Great show. People are complaining about commercials they need to shut up. There is one add for like 10 seconds before the show. Its not that bad. Great season did not see some stuff coming.
B00F3WB7FM,Jenn Weiskopff,5,This is the only television show that pushes the envelope. Every episode we say &#34;I cannot believe they went there&#34; and there are always new twists and turns. Great new season!
B00F3WB7FM,jim jones,5,Been hook from first episode was sorry to find out season 6 was going to be their last good entertainment!!!!!
B00F3WB7FM,john charles &#34; chuck&#34; "john c scharri...,5,The Sons is absolutely my favorite TV series this year. IT seems to fit the real action of a biker chapter. after all there were a couple real Hell's Angles in a few episodes . no I'm not joking.!! if you like biker movies this is the only place you need to go.try it out and you will agree.
B00F3WB7FM,Juan "Prince Moloch",5,This show lost some of its mojo in seasons 4 and 5 but its back on track. Not too thrilled with some of the story arcs but I am looking forward to its final season.
B00F3WB7FM,KK,5,By far one of the best shows on tv! Every episode of every season packs a punch and leaves u begging for more
B00F3WB7FM,K. Thomas,5,Love Sons of Anarchy ...been watching all the seasons. You never know where it is going to go. It is great. The actors/actresses are awesome.
B00F3WB7FM,Linda Saxton,5,Am so ready for season 7 wish it was not the final one
B00F3WB7FM,Liz Hart,5,I am addicted to this show. I never thought this would be the kind of show i'd like but I'm hooked. It's really worth trying. Thanks!
B00F3WB7FM,Lyle,5,Who is alive? Watch to find out. 1 of the many show unavailable for free with Amazon 90.00 a year Prime membership.Be prepared to pay a hugh price for season six available for free with other pay services.
B00F3WB7FM,Marguerite Martin,5,I don't know why I am so enamored by this violent show but I am hooked on it.  I am one of quite a few people who can't wait from one episode to the next.  Kurt Sutter must have a very dark soul to write the dialog for this show.
B00F3WB7FM,Melanie,5,Can't wait for next season.
B00F3WB7FM,mitch smith,5,This series constantly tops itself. This season blew me out of the water with some of the explosive plot twists. But logically everything ties together. Cannot wait for the final season.
B00F3WB7FM,MM,5,I can't get enough of this show. Jax is changing his character and we are really finding out who did and does what!!
B00F3WB7FM,NJ,5,The arc of the storylines build season to season.  Great characters and great internal conflicts that manifest with larger than life operatic (almost soap operatic) physical mayhem and destruction caused by those conflicts.
B00F3WB7FM,Patricia Ann,5,Season 6 has been bloody and painful as SAMCRO slides downhill to it's fate.Great performances from from all of the ensemble. It's kind of interesting thatas we see more of Jax's children the story gets darker and bleaker.
B00F3WB7FM,pepper1031,5,I bought some episodes to help us catch up since our DVR erased some on us. Love this series and it was a great season.
B00F3WB7FM,readinglarge,5,Wow folks this season will blow you away .I knew I had to have it but this was the most action filled season yet.buy buy buy I can't stress enough if you are a fan you will love it if not you will be one!
B00F3WB7FM,Rebecca Collins,5,I was lucky enough to find this series of shows &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34; ... the characters are unusual and each FIT the person exact .. the overall show is addictive to watch ... lots of events are shocking and a little hard to watch - but still a great show that I wish would continue.
B00F3WB7FM,Reta Kerr,3,This show was fun at first but now the violence has just gotten to be to much for me. It has become senseless and disgusting and plain boring.  No wonder our young people are getting more violent and having less and less care for human life. These types of show desensitizes our young minds. Started watching from the first episode so will finish it but after will try for less violent and more intellectual.
B00F3WB7FM,Richard L. Depatta,5,tada
B00F3WB7FM,R. Roeth,5,For a show in its 6th season Sons never disappointed. So many unexpected twists this show is my #1 &#34;guilty pleasure&#34;. The cast is just an amazing ensemble of talent and the writer(s) are beyond imaginative. I cannot wait for next season.
B00F3WB7FM,shaz,5,Best show besides the walking dead !  highly recommend
B00F3WB7FM,Shelly Alit,3,I could do with less raunchy sex scenes. The story line can hold its own with out them. Maybe they should try it. I know some people stopped watching due to that reason
B00F3WB7FM,Tara "Tara",5,This is by far the most intense episode yet.  The relationship between the guns jax gave out last season to one of those guns taking enter stage here makes you step back to think.  This episode has a message - a message that we need to pay a lot more attention to.  Amazing job on the acting and directing but above all amazing story telling here.  You need to get past the "Too soon" and angry reaction to think about the message here - best acting by Tate Berney.  He is a powerhouse.
B00F3WB7FM,TD,5,I am absolutely in love with Charlie Hunman so I definitely had to give season 6 5 stars. Season six was probably the most gut wrenching of all. Can't wait to see how everything unfolds in the final season!!!
B00F3WB7FM,T. Donoghue "Observer",3,This season is really lacking any emotional depth and it is just becoming just too cliche and the characters are just becoming numb and not compelling.Plus the violence is just too senseless and over the top as well.Jax and Gemma seem to be just phoning it in this season too.
B00F3WB7FM,Vnyrdstar,5,How can I watch Downton on one hand and Son's on the other. Well all I can say is a good story-teller and writer is everything and the story if it's good damn good doesn't matter. All I can say is WATCH
B00F3WOO70,alfredofranco,5,can't stop washing
B00F3WOO70,Artemis,5,awesome.  It's hard to believe they can keep this show fresh but they did!  well done writers keep it up
B00F3WOO70,Beverly A. Vokoun "justauntb",5,The 2 boys....their relationship....and the story lines. I just wish there were a few more shirtless scenes. Why hide those bodies with so much clothing?
B00F3WOO70,Chris W,5,Is it the most intense?  No.  Is it the funniest? No.The appealing thing about this show is the character development.  Over the course of the seasons you really feel like you get to know the characters.
B00F3WOO70,Colleen Weston,5,Totally excited that series 9 came out.  I was aftraid they were going to leave us hanging.  I just love watching this show!
B00F3WOO70,David Asensio,5,i have been a fan since it started i have enjoyed every episode i look forward to seeing it every night that it comes if you haven't seen it yet try it you'll like it
B00F3WOO70,Dental hygienist mom,5,Love this entire series! All characters have stayed true all the way to this final season. You have to start at the beginning to truly appreciate and you won't be disappointed!
B00F3WOO70,D. Molder "D. Molder",5,This series has gone many places in the supernatural Genre. I like where its going in this new season. They have brought some new life back into the series. I enjoy it.
B00F3WOO70,Floyd Hill "Hill",5,The series always has something different and it's good to watch! I can't wait to see what happens to the Angels!
B00F3WOO70,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,This 9th season continues the fabulous tradition of excellence expected from this show.  The Winchester boys are back with all the twists and turns.
B00F3WOO70,James Westervelt,3,some of the episodes were great others  were so so.The wizard of oz take off was too much for me.
B00F3WOO70,Jeffrey Ehlenfeld "Jeff",3,I really liked the early episodes but the story line just became to boring to continue watching. I think the angel was the best character in the entire series.
B00F3WOO70,Jenn Weiskopff,5,This season sticks to the story line for the most part and only deviates away for a case or two. If you missed season 8 you definitely want to watch that first and catch up on the story line!
B00F3WOO70,Josh L. Hansen "J Hansen",5,Oh yeah!  Season 9 does not disappoint!  Loved seasons 1-8 and they have not missed a beat going into this year's awesome season.  Great character development as always.  Love this series!
B00F3WOO70,JT,5,Great story to go along with a great cast. Definitely a show for people who like things that go bump in the night.
B00F3WOO70,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,Love this series fell in love by accident with this one years ago love sam and dean awesome in too many way and always getting better
B00F3WOO70,Melody Garcia "tattoomama",5,AWESOME! I love this show so much and don't mind paying for downloads. The quality of the downloads is very good.
B00F3WOO70,Peggy Carey,5,The best show ever!  Hubby and I make a weekly day together to watch it together. I have every season and have seen everyone at least 5 times!
B00F3WOO70,pepper1031,5,I love these guys! This show just keeps getting better and better! They are so good together and are so funny.
B00F3WOO70,Samantha English,4,Great show and of course big cliff-hanging ending of the series! I cannot wait for next season!
B00F3WOO70,The repair guy,5,How could you not like this show and the season if you are a sci fi fan than this show is the cream in your coffee. The crew and the show are top shelf the acting and the writing the best ever the only thing that worries me is can there be another show I will watch that will be good enough now.
B00F3WOO70,woody,5,great video it looks real and it has a lot of action and not a lot of cussing and I like the story
B00F406S2U,Amazon Customer,5,Hope to see Arrow for many seasons to come i love the twists and action.  Makes you want to go out and help others.
B00F406S2U,Amazon Customer,5,I love this show!  The casting is perfect and the plots are imaginative! Keep them coming for many seasons to come!
B00F406S2U,Anubis,5,Arrow season 2 was hands down incredible.  I cannot wait for the 3rd season to start!
B00F406S2U,aweewee,5,Love this show! I highly recommend it and was glad that all of the shows were there now online where the first 5 shows were missing.
B00F406S2U,btjones1983,5,Just as good as the first season! Amazing story line. Good pick up from the first season. Characters continue to develop.
B00F406S2U,carrie,5,THIS IS TV SERIES COME HELL OR HIGH WATER IT AND FLASH ME AND HUBBY 19YRS AGREE ON SO PLZ THINK ABOUT MY MARRIAGE KEEP IT
B00F406S2U,Cory,5,I absolutely cannot wait til the new one comes on because I am infatuated with all of the Arrow Seasons and they leave off on parts that keeps you wanting more!
B00F406S2U,dennis headley,5,Definitely the best &#34;super hero&#34; type show on TV and its almost like two shows in one with the flashbacks to the island and the present
B00F406S2U,Donald G. Siering,5,this show is like two shows in one...one about Ollie's captive years on the island and the present day....always suspenseful and the eye candy abounds!
B00F406S2U,Elliot Viker,5,Lots of action and follows the comic green arrow story line loosely.  An interesting change from zombies and the reality shows that are on the television most of the time.  .
B00F406S2U,Floyd Hill "Hill",5,This is a good action packed series and it's not boring! A great adaptation from the original Green Arrow story and it's getting better!
B00F406S2U,Gary R. Jordan,4,I tried the first episodes and began to enjoy it.I'm interested in what the next season as in store.
B00F406S2U,George Beltz,5,I really like this series the story line stays fresh and the acting in this series is great. Keep up the good work.
B00F406S2U,Heather Scott,5,they have great tv episodes love the story line its different from the other tv shows that are out right now
B00F406S2U,James Hall,5,Great tv series! If you like comic book series along with action pack movies than you should check this out. The acting is cheesy but if you can get past that it is a solid find.
B00F406S2U,Janet Gagej,4,Love comic book characters.  Takes me back to my childhood when all my problems were in the books I read.  Fun to revisit and the acting is better than most T V.
B00F406S2U,jay,5,This show is spin off of  green arrow from dc comics good story with good acting has good action also overall a must watch show amazing
B00F406S2U,JJ,5,This show is heavy on the dark side of human nature.  While no mistaking this for a great acting set.  The plots are good and the producer/director have turn this Marvel Book into a great series.  We love this show.  There are villains every turn and twist!  Pretty heavy on the gore!  Not recommended for the squeamish or people younger than 16!  We love the characters!
B00F406S2U,J. lavine "suzl",5,We really got hooked into this series and find it entertaining with just enough twists to keep engaging. No graphic violence.
B00F406S2U,JV,5,When is season three going to start I want more I look forward to seeing this show so keep them coming awesome cast.
B00F406S2U,K. Thomas,5,Love Arrow. Have been watching it every since it's first episode. It just keeps getting better. Definately a must see season.
B00F406S2U,Linda K. Holman,5,Arrow is a fantastic series.  I have watched it from the beginning.  I cannot wait for each new episode.
B00F406S2U,M. A. Griffin,4,Been watching this series for a while and it is still holding my interest.  I like the introduction of new characters which has expanded the plot.  So far so good.
B00F406S2U,MARK J. LONG "Martok",5,The writers or producers for this show were with Smallvile. The first season was excellent. No reason the second shouldn't be excellent either.
B00F406S2U,Melanie,4,Good show
B00F406S2U,Michael B.,5,I watched the first season of this show and became hooked. I read some of the Green Arrow comics in my youth which I found to be stupid but this show is not like the comic. The Green Arrow that was in Smallville can't compare to &#34;Arrow&#34;. This show is more grounded in the real type world. The &#34;Arrow&#34; as they refer to does do in the bad guys (That's kills them). Even in the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; Superman had to make a choice to save lives beyond the comic book image. The characters in the show draw on comic book characters in some way but with a twist. The Black Canary in &#34;Arrow&#34; is not the same as the comic book but the &#34;Huntress&#34; seems to be following the same type story line. Oliver Queen (The Arrow) has a family which adds to the plot. Also I'm learning some Russian from the show.
B00F406S2U,Michelle King,5,This show has lots of action and the drama is not to much.  The story keeps you on your toes.
B00F406S2U,MVivar,4,An exciting fantasy just short of believable. Couldn't think of anything disliked. Acting was acceptable though slightly stiff at times.
B00F406S2U,Paula Jankowski,5,Record it if I am not home please keep onEveryone in the show is greatPlease keep on tv
B00F406S2U,Penny Abernathy,5,My husband loves this series.  He has a lot of fun watching it.  He finds the characters engaging and the story line entertaining.
B00F406S2U,Perry,5,I didn't start watching this show until the start of 2nd season where I then watched all of season 1 and then caught up to what is live on tv. Great cast and enjoy the references/easter eggs. If you are a fan of comics and shows like Smallville then you should love this show. It's very addicting.
B00F406S2U,STONE A JUDLIN "cajun 2 step cut short?",5,What a gorgeous cast of characters.  Storyline is very entertaining as well.  It was fun to see one of the stars of &#34;Sparticus&#34; here!
B00F406S2U,Terrianne Neill,5,My sons love this series and never wants to miss a single episode! It is fast fun and exciting! Our whole family is now watching Arrow!
B00F406S2U,Terry Richardson,4,Really good show. Few compliants. Really just enjoy this one. Wish they had done some things different with Oliver's family.
B00F406S2U,thepoetnmotion,5,Lots of action and surprisingly good acting. I've enjoyed every episode. If you like comic book entertainment I recommend watching the series.
B00F406S2U,Tim Hitchcock,3,I love the background flasbacks but they are more interesting than the show. Im hoping the show gets better. There is not much left to flash back to for me to keep watching....
B00F406S2U,Vivian M. Shepherd "book lover",3,IT IS OKAY I WILL WATCH IT BUT IT IS NOT AT THE TOP OF MY LIST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFEERNT THEN WHAT IT IS IT IS LIKE SOAP OPREA
B00F49A3A4,Bobby L. Sheppard "Shepdog",5,Great character development and great show.  I just wish the main character would actually show some strength (aka &#34;balls&#34;) going forward.
B00F49A3A4,Bookworm2,3,This a pretty average movie about super beings and as usual they're young mainstream types. It's not unlike many of the same formulaic TV and move films you've seen before. Supernatural beings hunted by some "Big Brother" type guy who either wants to destroy the Supers or used this for his own selfish goals. Nothing new here at all.
B00F49A3A4,carrie,5,SO HATE HEARD CANCELLED WHO KNOWS HOW STUPID THESE NETWORKS ARE I SERIOUSLY SHOULD RUN MY OWN BETWEEN I HAVE INFO FOR ANY TV BS WEATHER SEEN OR NOT I AM BETTER THAN PEOPLE CHOSEN SCREW OFF TV LATELY IT REALLY HAS CRAP ON
B00F49A3A4,Chris NYC,5,Just love this show! What a wonderful re-make of the original UK version of the Tomorrow People. This show is very modern and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I hope there is a season 2 because it's like the movie Jumper but for television!
B00F49A3A4,David Asensio,5,this show has evolved so much from it's original presentations in the 60's the basic premise is the same but a modern twist anyone who into the sci-fi/action geneire will like this show i highly recommend it
B00F49A3A4,dennis headley,4,This series is off to a good start and I really like the premise and the story so far but wonder where it is all heading to make it a multi-season show.
B00F49A3A4,D. K. Peel "jstkdn",5,I enjoyed this program very much. I hope there is more soon. I like si-fi and this show is very imaginative
B00F49A3A4,Jeffrey Ehlenfeld "Jeff",4,The first season seems to hold my attention but I must admit that if the plot doesn't change I will soon lose interest. I hope the writers offer up a second season with a new and fresh plot  to pursue.
B00F49A3A4,JV,5,Love this show please keep it coming I look so forward to seeing more seasons bring it on want to see season 2 and 3 already don't keep us waiting too long. Great Actors.
B00F49A3A4,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,I personally like to love this show I think it could be one of those you either really get it or dont try a episode see if you like it if so then go for it
B00F49A3A4,Larry Baker,5,This show is very creative and kept interesting.  I am very interested to see the second season.The actors were good.  The story line excellent.
B00F49A3A4,Miss Amanda Marie,5,Great show love the characters great action and it's different from a lot of other shows on tv at this time
B00F49A3A4,Robert J. Quigley "specs",2,I never got to see it.  I don't know what night it is on.  End of the story.  I am done.
B00F49E8O6,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I love this show. I cannot get enough of it. I love the growing camaraderie between the two officers: human/synthetic and android. It's also very funny how the android comes off as more human. It's a great sci-fi show!
B00F49E8O6,Alvin Oliver,5,This is one of the most innovative new shows on in quite a while.  We are absolutely loving it and hope it returns next season.
B00F49E8O6,a reader,5,Great show and lots of fun !  very interesting premise and character development is quite good.  A very good time watching this show
B00F49E8O6,Bazajaytee "Bazajaytee",5,Was an interesting show and both my wife and I enjoyed watching it. The actors work well off each other and the story is different enough to not be repetitive.Shame it got canned :(
B00F49E8O6,books-a-bazillion "books-a-bazillion",5,I love sci-fi and this is a very enjoyable show.  The two main characters work well together.  Don't miss it.
B00F49E8O6,Carlos Sullivan,4,The only thing missing from this fantastic show (thus the 4 star rather than 5 star rating) is an overarching story line like the X-Files had with the aliens or Fringe had with the baldies/alternate realities.
B00F49E8O6,Coreguy "Dennis Mitchell",5,The premise looks interesting. I am eager to view the series when it comes out. I seems the network extended the start date out into the month.
B00F49E8O6,dennis headley,5,This is hands down the best new show of t he fall. The two leads are funny and play off each other well
B00F49E8O6,D. Smith "Global Nomad",5,This is looking to be my new favorite show. I like the shows that are set in the future. I recommend.
B00F49E8O6,gerry d lay,5,I was hesitant to watch the series at first but gave the pilot a try and am i glad i did the story is well thought out and interesting. The actors mesh well together and provide Solid entertainment a mix of humor / humanity which is rare
B00F49E8O6,johnstars,4,Acting very good . Great humor . Good character development.Plot very good Like gadgets. Keep up good work! More female characters.How bout  Hot Female android?
B00F49E8O6,JV,5,Great show waiting for season Two hurry with it can't wait to see more of it. I hope it will be real soon keep it coming I will buy the seasons.
B00F49E8O6,KBZ "writeon",2,I did not see &#34;The Complete First Season&#34; of Almost Human. I only saw a trailer-so I cannot fairly or fully assess the show. It looks &#34;okay&#34; and I'll give it a shot. Perhaps you should too.
B00F49E8O6,Kisa,3,I like the show but it didn't captivate me. The lead actor stands out from a Star Trek episode he did that I will never forget. He's a good actor but in a &#34;cheesy&#34; way. LOL! The show kept my attention but no sure if it's all that!!!
B00F49E8O6,M. A. Griffin,5,Love the characters and back story of the series. This show has soooo many ways it can go I'm excited to see which ways it does go.
B00F49E8O6,Miss Amanda Marie,5,Great show I really hope they don't cancel it
B00F49E8O6,Paula Jankowski,5,Hope it gets more seasonsKarl Urban is great but his partner is just as greatLove him would like to see him more
B00F49E8O6,P. Street,5,Reminds me somewhat of a cross between the movie &#34;Surrogates&#34; and &#34;iRobot&#34; - both of which I enjoy thoroughly. The actors are engaging; the plot was intriguing.  I hope the rest of the season is as good as the pilot.
B00F49E8O6,Rene',3,This show has potential but it's disjointed because the episodes didn't air in sequence and you can tell.  I like the characters but it needs to get better in order to get a second season.
B00F49E8O6,Rugby,4,If you like sci fy detectives the future robots hunky men this is for you! I hope they get more seasons.
B00F49E8O6,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,I am loving these!  It is about the future with a cop and his sidekick that he ended up getting that was the only one available...the old issue that was an experiment and had more human qualities and emotions.  Love It.
B00F49E8O6,TGFan,5,Excellent writing.  The writers are taken an old idea and making it worth watching.  The actors are making the characters much more real than previous attempts.
B00F49E8O6,Tony AbernathySr,4,Who could have envisioned a sidekick/partner show that has a robot teaching a human about feelings. Tense action with just the right mix of seriousness and humor.
B00F49E8O6,Valerie J. Douglas "Author and Dream Weaver",4,Karl Urban and Michael Ealy give humanity - despite one being a robot - to their roles. Lily Taylor and Mackenzie Crook are perfect as the Lt. and the geeky tech.
B00F49E8O6,William Brennan "wreckingball34",5,I love Sci-fi so this show is right up my alley. Great FX and two great lead characters make for entertaining TV. Karl Urban and Michael Ealey are very effective in their roles as Detective John Kennex and his unique android partner Dorian. Their chemistry is already evident and I hope they get  the chance to hang around and explore it further. It would be nice to get to know some of the other characters in the show as well.
B00F49E8O6,William M. Klepper "BK",5,I just bought a season pass to &#34;Almost Human&#34; and I love it. It's a nice mix of robots and police men solving crimes and these two trying to get along. I think the endearing part about the show is that the robot is more humane than his human partner. There is a nice mixture of humor and high tech to keep me interested. I highly recommend it to anyone who liked Monk or Sherlock Holmes.
B00F4PKH5E,B. Merrill,5,The show is hilarious. Great cast of dysfunctional friends and family that hits many way too close to home. I laugh but can almost feel the pain of the situations that the family goes through. Show is fun to watch I think you can put it with any of the sitcoms out there that make you laugh. definitely worth watching.
B00F4PKH5E,Carol Stalling "Crossroads",3,I did enjoy it. I have only seen one episode but will be watching more in the future. I'm a big fan of the actress who plays the mom which is why I ordered the 1st episode.
B00F4PKH5E,Just Another Page,5,This show is so funny with its dysfunctional characters. I laugh every single time I watch it. I love Anna Farris and the woman that plays her mother. I hope this show gets the attention it deserves.
B00F4PKH5E,nocnotes2day,5,There is something so human about this show. I like the mother daughter mother relationship that is finally shown for what it truly is....Complicated!  But with a great sense of humor.
B00F4PKH5E,Ponytail Pam,5,Great show!!! Love the dynamics of the cast!! Allison Janney is superb in her roll and leads the cast beautifully.
B00F55HIRI,ablatt123,5,KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!!  Cant wait for the next season!  I'm chomping at the bit for it!
B00F55HIRI,Amazon Customer,5,I love this more adult spinoff version from Vampire Diaries.  The writing is terrific!  And the casting is just right too!
B00F55HIRI,Amazon Customer,5,Normally I'm a little wary of spin off shows but this one is amazing. If you like The Vampire Diaries you will love The Originals. I suppose you could watch this without having watched The Vampire Diaries but it will make a whole lot more sense if you watch both.
B00F55HIRI,bannaner,5,The acting and storylines are exceptional. Joseph Morgan adds such depth to his character with every episode. He makes the viewers crave more. Daniel and Claire are perfect as Klaus's siblings. Their main goal is to help Klaus find his humanity. He may find it if he has a reason. Their hoping the reason will be an unborn child that will bring Klaus the unconditional love that he wants.
B00F55HIRI,Barbara A. Saunders-jones "BASJ",1,...not for adults. Boring. There's not much else one can say about this series. Why should creatures who live for hundreds of years still be trying to work out adolescent angst? I don't care enough to watch and see if this question can be answered.
B00F55HIRI,BarbaraKButler,5,I have watched many vampire movies and series but this one is good because it shows a 'human' side to the characters. They may be vampires but they are family.
B00F55HIRI,barbie "doggy mom",5,Im sure everyone knows the orinals are part of the vampire diaries series. This show is awesome and shows more of their side! My husband and I both love this series! If you love the vampire diaries then this is a must watch!
B00F55HIRI,ccc,5,i like seeing the split from the other show. gives more of a background of the originals and how they work.
B00F55HIRI,David Asensio,5,This show is excellent you don't need to see Vampire Diaries to see this show i thought i wouldn't like it but i like it alot it's all well done a show worth watching
B00F55HIRI,E. Best,5,An intellegent show with first rate acting.  Makes you believe in the early days of NO and all the spirits in that world there.  You won't be able to stop watching it.
B00F55HIRI,EVE  ADAMS,5,What  a  great  name for a great  show. I love it. It's  original  how can you not. Especially  Elijah he is really  getting  hotter  and hotter  with every new episode.
B00F55HIRI,Floyd Hill "Hill",5,This is an awesome series and it's bad ass! I think Klaus and Elijah was a great mix and now the fun begins!
B00F55HIRI,Gemma Rocks SOA,5,This show is fabulous and can't get enough of Klaus and Elijah!!! Marcel and Davina are captivating along with Haley and Rebekah.
B00F55HIRI,Glenn H. Duncan,5,Gets better every episode can not wait until the next one. Started with vampire dairies and  continued with this spinoff.
B00F55HIRI,Melody Garcia "tattoomama",5,I loved when the Originals was introduced on Vampire Diaries. I was ready for the new show when it aired. I like downloading the episodes so I can watch them as many times as I want.
B00F55HIRI,Northerngal,5,I am really enjoying this spin off from the Vampire Diaries.  Quite possibly better than the original Vampire Diaries!  I think the old &#34;Originals&#34; are very compelling and I find their story interesting.  Klaus is simply magnificant - he goes from utterly charming to absolutely menacing in a split second.....VERY fun to watch!
B00F55HIRI,S. Heath,5,I really like the Originals.  There is just something about Klaus and Elijah that just draws you in.  I can not wait for more episodes!
B00F55HIRI,T. Brady "Tom",2,This series is not as appealing to me as The Vampire Diaries.  That is the only reason why I have cancelled my series purchase.
B00F55HIRI,Triciatx,5,Love the characters and story line !! I like the idea that it is all taken place in NOLA and away from Mystic Falls.
B00F55HIRI,Vickie Staton "Quickvick",5,I watched the Vampire Diaries and when this series started; I thought I would check it out.  Great series; highly recommend!
B00F55HIRI,Victoria R. Brown,3,Would love to see this in its entirety.  Don't want to have to wait until the nightly viewing on television.
B00F55HZB2,Kisa,1,Waste of MONEY! The first episode was already shot and story was already given in the show Vampire Diaries. Why would anyone be interested in a family of egocentric characters that no one really likes? The acting is very good but the characters are 2-dimentional and uninteresting.
B00F57MNBC,Amazon Customer,5,These guys win! They are two of the funniest people on TV. It is worth watching every episode from every season.
B00F57MNBC,Duc Nguyen,5,Funny and interesting.  The comedy makes you laugh and think at the same time ... basically it hits you right in the racism.
B00F57MNBC,V. Aub,4,Funny show but its beginning to be less fresh as the first two seasons.
B00F6F2U5M,Alice,5,We really liked this show even the kids that are 8 and 9 years old. They sit with us and watch this show as they did they got an idea about remodeling a old chair that we have. So we did a family project together and it came out great. Thanks
B00F6F2U5M,George Klander,3,I enjoy flea markets...but this seems a little too contrived and over the top.  It reminds me of the PBS series set up in Britain some years ago which was much more believable and fun.
B00F6F2U5M,Ixias,3,It's fun to see what the participants make with the things that they find at the flea market. The host gives them excellent input to help them make projects more likely to sell.
B00F6F2U5M,jatnj "Janet",4,This show was fun to watch and inspiring for people who like to recycle.  I don't know why HGTV didn't make more episodes.
B00F6F2U5M,Mardee "Mardee",5,This show is fun and creative.  It's also pretty amusing to see see some of the ideas these folk come up with.  I thinks it's a fun and wholsome show.  Good for all ages.  Hope this helps!
B00F6F2U5M,Mr. Phil,3,Seems a bit contrived.  Only place it could possibly work is NYC where there is a lot of stupid money.  Dirty mMoney is a much better show about the same thing.
B00F6F2U5M,Sandra Seebers "Avid Reader",4,The pilot was a hoot. So different from what became regular for the rest of the season and season 2. I love how they turn things into great stuff! Can't wait for new seasons!!!
B00F6PKYX2,Amazon Customer "&#34;Insert snazzy catchphra...,4,It's good...it's *worth* buying...but I have to admit that the series is missing...something...that the writing of the original Avatar had. I worry for its survival...it feels like they're in danger of shark jumping.
B00F6PKYX2,Bandit,5,We really enjoyed watching this with the family. It ended too quickly and we are waiting for next seasoN! My son likes it even more than Last Airbender. I like it nearly as much.
B00F6PKYX2,Christopher R. Williams,5,The legends of Kora is definitely no match for the original series (at least yet) but that doesn't mean it isn't good. i love the complex ideas about society that these shows are able to illustrate. very quality show and writing.
B00F6PKYX2,D. Molder "D. Molder",5,This is a good sit down with your kids series. It has enough storyline and plot twists to keep even grown ups interested. Watch the first 3 seasons of the original Avatar series then watch the first season of this series. If you like season 1 of this series you will definitely like this season.
B00F6PKYX2,Jack,1,Not a story line I can follow. I wish I could have my time back after watching this the program.
B00F6PKYX2,Lydia Buitron,5,takes you on a ride with the Civil War she starts. The ending is not so great but leaving you for more definitely....
B00F6PKYX2,Rene',4,This show is getting better the longer it runs.  I had my doubts at first but not I'm sold.  I hope they keep it up.
B00F6PKYX2,victor,5,I was skeptical at first but really really enjoyed watching this show. I am still not completely sold but it did impress me enough to continue to WANT to watch it..
B00F6PL4G8,Agnieszka Koszowska "MovieLOVER",5,I started to watch the show randomly...after I finished some other season I liked...and it sucked me in! Even my husband askes all the time if there is a new episode!!!
B00F6PL4G8,Beverly A. Peeples "Gatorlaw",3,I really enjoyed this show in seasons 1-3  but this one is not as good and the same story line in every site about this guy William is getting old.  William is not a nice person and he needs to be gone.
B00F6PL4G8,Christpher D. Quye "Cidjack",4,I love Haven and have watched it since the beginning. I have thoroughly enjoyed the show. it is unique and character driven.
B00F6PL4G8,C. Van Blake,5,Another great season for Haven fans. Just when you though it was all over. New characters and the troubles are kicking up a notch!
B00F6PL4G8,Hpsweet,4,Great casting choices - some typical plot lines - a few I couldn't get past - and the ever present boy meets girl meets another boy cant decide then decides then wont follow through - but for the most part cleverly written and funny scenes to overcome the typical plots.
B00F6PL4G8,kevin m love,4,Great new challenges and I like the new character. Writers should provide more incremental resolution to sub plots periodically though.
B00F6PL4G8,Kindle Customer,4,For someone who is not a big scifi fan I really enjoy this series.  The characters are well written and the acting is excellent.
B00F6PL4G8,KMaggi3,5,I'm hooked on Haven!  Such a good show.  Love the cast.  Season 4 has a really good twist.  Can't wait to get it on DVD.
B00F6PL4G8,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,5,THE STORY LINE THIS SEASON IS MORE SURREAL. I LIKE THE WAY EVERYBODY WANTS CERTIAN PEOPLE DEAD.AND OUR GIRL WILL BE COMMING HOME.
B00F6PL4G8,michele symonette,5,This is an interesting series it keeps your interest without being cheesy or throwing in sex whenever the writers get stalled.  The caracters develope in an interesting way
B00F6PL4G8,Neil Bergman,4,Interesting twists so far this season. I still enjoy the characters as much as the previous seasons. It will be interesting to see how they tie everything together. It seems to me that this should be the last season of the show without stretching it out beyond credulity.
B00F6PL4G8,raven,5,looking forward to renewal for season 5 as season 1 through 4 were very interesting and i loved them all.
B00F6PL4G8,Sandra L. Cassidy,3,I love this show but I really didn't like this season as well. I know they have to take it in a different direction but the last few shows weren't that good to me
B00F6PL4G8,SHERRI,3,Too much going on. This sitcom is running out of story line. The first season was good. Not for now&#34;
B00F87ZUYG,Amazon Customer,4,I love my Walking Dead.This episode was good...but also seemed to meander a bit.  A little less cohesiveness than most of the episodes.Reminds me a bit of early Season 2...setting up the plots and sub-plots for the rest of the season.
B00F87ZUYG,Amazon Customer,5,I was never much of a zombie lover but I do like apocalyptic stories and this series manages to combine the two in a most interesting way. Even with the splurge of gore the show is well written and the characters are compelling.
B00F87ZUYG,AnnaC "AnnaC",5,This show has continued to improve. The characters are incredibly engaging. Ultimately a show about human relationships. Very well done.
B00F87ZUYG,Anne Deaton "Maggie - Cocker Momma",4,The acting is very good and the premise is one that has always been a favorite with sci-fi/fantasy lovers. My only real criticism and what kept me from giving it a five star rating is that the  special effects and makeup could be a bit more realistic. Other than that - it is all thumbs up.
B00F87ZUYG,A. Robinson "hotarobin",4,Walking Dead started out great then they seemed to have lost the way and the show got a bit boring.  But the season 4 mid season finale was just what the show needed.  I gave 4 stars hoping the the makers will read these reviews and know that there is still more work to be done. I love the new concept in modern day series where almost no one is untouchable...anything can happen at any time and Walking Dead embraces this well.  I cannot wait for the this mid season break to come to an end.
B00F87ZUYG,AUBREYGAMMON3,5,My Wife Love To Watch The Walking Dead Me And My Wife Just Can't Wait To See The Forth Season.
B00F87ZUYG,Bacon,4,Kind of slow the first 4 episodes... but still good. Budget cuts have reduced the amount of zombie battles. This is pretty noticeable.
B00F87ZUYG,Barbara J. Mcdermott,5,I have been watching this since Season 1. I love how they struggle to keep themselves alive and still face adversaries from within groups.
B00F87ZUYG,becca,5,This season so far has been more about who the people become after the initial shock of the walkers has set in. The new threat of illness heightens the anxiety of wondering how they will possibly make it out alive!
B00F87ZUYG,Beverly A. Vokoun "justauntb",5,The best show on TV. The characters interaction is awesome. The story lines are great. The zombies are really just a side of this program.
B00F87ZUYG,bob is dead,5,Love this show
B00F87ZUYG,Boulder Mike,5,they getting into individual characters now...character development...very interesting...every time it gets a little too cozy new bad guys show up or the inevitable zombies. If it gets too bad there is always a recovery of couse...great show..
B00F87ZUYG,Briar Lee Mitchell,5,Great show. Well written. Excellent cast and engaging story lines. We care what happens to these people and hope they survive in what might eventually be a better world.
B00F87ZUYG,Butch Holmberg,5,Always a twist in the plot with well scripted acting. Each episode is building upon the previous one not knowing what is going to happen next to a someone next. It is sad to see some of the interesting actors depart.
B00F87ZUYG,Cat Woman Returns "Kitty",5,At first I hated this show... could not seem to get past the zombies....  but I got hooked and now I don't want it to end.
B00F87ZUYG,ccc,5,can hardly wait for the new episodes to return and finish will keep watching until the series ends. great series.
B00F87ZUYG,C. Gifford "CCChris",1,I was charged for 3 zero number episodes for Season 4 of which I have only seen 8.A preview or whatever you want to call it I did not order and should not have been charged for ever.Very unhappy
B00F87ZUYG,Charles J. Mcpeak "mcpeak2",5,It always leaves you wanting more!
B00F87ZUYG,Christopher R. Williams,5,This season is definitely holding up well. it is definitely keeping fresh and exciting into the 4th season. cant wait to see more.
B00F87ZUYG,C. J. Gerhardt,4,It's one of the best shows on t.v.! The production values are top notch and the character development keeps you coming back.
B00F87ZUYG,ColinMcKie,5,I am a Walking Dead fan head so nothing that they produce is les than 5 stars for me. A bit slower than the previous seasons but that is good because it allows more depth to be created by each of the actors.
B00F87ZUYG,cottageprims,5,Just started watching but so far promises to be good. One of my favorite series and I'm not even into zombies.Great story line but not for people who can't overlook some gore.
B00F87ZUYG,Craig C. Albano,4,A drama in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.  Season 4 moves a little slower than the previous seasons but there's some really great things to see!
B00F87ZUYG,Crzyoldone,5,What can one say about a show that is so inventive and leaves you on the edge of your seat at the end of each episode.
B00F87ZUYG,C.S.,5,Love this series!  This a great show and love being able to catch up when we miss out watching a night.
B00F87ZUYG,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,This is a very good series and the fourth series is shaping up very well.  The group is all shattered and trying to find each other.  I just like to say this is a good series to watch.
B00F87ZUYG,Danny L. Abernathy,3,Not as intense/Must be getting my senses dulled/Aren't we all getting immuned?About time time to wind down.
B00F87ZUYG,Darlene,5,The entire series is captivating.  It is interesting to watch how the writers capture what people need to do to survive and the lengths they will go to.  I think the writers have it down pat.  Excellent series and an excellent season.
B00F87ZUYG,Dona L. Sears "searsgig",5,fantastic!  gripping!!
B00F87ZUYG,Doug,5,You can't go wrong with the walking dead. Each season gets better and better. Looking forward to the 3rd season 2nd episode.
B00F87ZUYG,dray83,4,The Walking Dead is always great to watch.  It'll be interesting to see where the story goes from here because a lot was setup that will affect future episodes.
B00F87ZUYG,Dr. Who?,5,The Walking Dead is back and as good as it ever was. Don't even think about watching season 4 if you haven't seen the first 3 seasons. Start from the beginning. You won't regret it.
B00F87ZUYG,E B Fricks,5,Great cast great writing! the zombies are a constant menace but what keeps me coming back for more is the great &#34;very dark and gritty&#34; story line.
B00F87ZUYG,Floyd Hill "Hill",5,Awesome! That's all that needs to be said about this series. I can't wait until the next season to begin!
B00F87ZUYG,Francisco Loaiza,5,A bit gory but a good story nonetheless.That's pretty much it I like the character development as well. Cool.
B00F87ZUYG,Frank D. Castellano "fcaste",5,I can't believe Season 4 is over. It should go on and on for the entire year.I may not even watch it again since there are shows coming out that are getting better and better all the time.The &#34;Crawling Dead&#34; may be the next series for all I know. Or even &#34;Walking on One Leg Dead.&#34; Or &#34;The Confused Dead.&#34;
B00F87ZUYG,Gary R. Jordan,5,This season rased the bar to be a great season.I can not wait until the second part of the season begins!
B00F87ZUYG,Grumpy Guy,5,The Walking Dead team has accomplished something quite difficult.  They've taken a season to deeply develop characters without sacrificing the action and suspense the show is known for.  Kudos!
B00F87ZUYG,Heather Hintz,5,I just started watching the walking Dead in November. They did a great job on the TV Show. I am reading the first Book. &#34;The Rise of the Governor&#34;. I must say I am enjoying it. It is much different from the show. I cannot wait to read the comic.
B00F87ZUYG,James A. Moore "Jim",4,I can see why they made a sociology course out of this. There's sooooo much going on and so many situations.
B00F87ZUYG,Janette M. Guyre,5,I so enjoy it and get caught holding my breath at times afraid of what will happen or I will get happy when things are positive
B00F87ZUYG,Jared,5,My wife watches this show.  If you are into zombie survival this is for you.  Never know what is around the corner.  Maybe its zombie!
B00F87ZUYG,jimmarx,5,I'm not into &#34;Zombie&#34; flics but this show has such a great storyline I can't wait until the next episode.
B00F87ZUYG,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Great season so far. Always a surprise can't wait to see what is next. Makes you feel like you should have a plan...just in case.
B00F87ZUYG,Joan,5,Who doesn't love this program?  Except maybe those Zombies out there.  You never know who is going to get eaten .............could Rick be next?
B00F87ZUYG,joe,5,I have been a fan of the show since I saw the first episode. it has its slow points and action packed moments. but what makes this show stick out is the twist and turns. watching this show is kind of like driving in a winding canyon at top speed in a corvette. some turns ya see others you try to make but you just don't know if your going to end up in the rail or down the road. only stopping to cheek your self after a sharp turn.  if you like watching Zombie movies or like seeing the human element in something other then a &#34;reality tv show&#34; you should love all of the walking dead
B00F87ZUYG,Karen,5,It's very easy to connect with the roles of the actors and feel involved in this series.I recommend this!!
B00F87ZUYG,Keats,5,I worried about this season. Could they keep the same level of interest as previous? Were they running out of ideas?Turns out no.  The show is fantastic. It's devloped new characters and given depth to old ones.
B00F87ZUYG,Kerry A. Barndt,5,My husband & I both love watching this and can't wait for the next episode.  Actors are really good and storyline is great.
B00F87ZUYG,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,Zombies never watched a show on them before this show made me see it all in a new way show has a way of drawing you in certain characters you either love or hate not even one sees or feels the same though
B00F87ZUYG,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",4,Not as good an episode as I've seen in the past.  Wonder if the writer isn't getting tired and used this as filler.
B00F87ZUYG,Lee Robinson,5,No shortage of dramatic tension when there are flesh eating zombies everywhere and no one has found enough peace and stability to farm or trade with humans.
B00F87ZUYG,L Hill,5,Excellent!! I absolutely love love love this show. Every season gets better and better. The characters are great and its brilliantly written
B00F87ZUYG,Liz Hart,5,I'm addicted to this show&#8230;don't have full cable anymore just choose the shows I like. Took awhile to get adduced to the show but now love it. Thanks!
B00F87ZUYG,Liz Lambdin,5,Didn't think I could watch episode after episode of zombies - but it turned out YES I COULD word word word word word
B00F87ZUYG,Melanie,5,Awesome!
B00F87ZUYG,Michael "beergut",1,if your farm was being over run by zombies- wouldn't you just use the dozer to dig a mote around it?better yet... wouldn't you just go to the city center and dig a huge hole- put a few cows in it and wait for all the zombies to fall into it- then just light it up? or- wouldn't you make way to the coast- jump on a 35' yacht and head to an indo-pacific island that's untouched by the virus? or just live  on a 50' yacht in the water where you'd never have to worry about a zombie sneaking up on you?the writers skip over the most sensible and logical ways to regain control of a zombie infested world.very weak story line- poor character development- silly premise after silly premise... just one big FAIL.
B00F87ZUYG,Michael D. Anderson,5,One of the reasons I think this series does so well is that you never know which characters will live and which will die--even some of the most endearing and important people may not survive--and they face new problems in a believable situation each season that lends to even greater enjoyment.
B00F87ZUYG,Michael Duffy,5,If you are a fan of Walking Dead....this is a simple MUST have item!  Creepy suspense and unexpected twists keep you riveted on the edge of your seat!
B00F87ZUYG,Michael Hayes,5,One of the best shows ever created. Well written story line with great action and realistic scenes.  This is Sons of Anarchy are the best &#128077;&#128077;&#128077;&#128540;
B00F87ZUYG,Mike suell,5,This is my favorite show
B00F87ZUYG,M. McKenzie,5,The hope string.The great acting.The horror of it all.don't break our heartsdon't break themdo not.
B00F87ZUYG,Mouve E. Freeke "Oh! Weird One!",5,One of the very best shows on television.  It has remained so for over 3 seasons.  Each year has built successfully on the previous season(s).
B00F87ZUYG,Nancy Mayton,5,Walking Dead is the best ever all thought season 4 started out kinda boring it ended up with you on your toes wanting to see the next season for sure....
B00F87ZUYG,Nicole Crew "Trauma Queen",5,Not pleased by who was killed off or abandoned. But I love this show and hope it lasts forever. Got very dark since season 1. But it's reality of what the apocalypse would be like.
B00F87ZUYG,Nicole Smith,5,Can't get enough. leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting more every time.
B00F87ZUYG,Pamela,5,Gory but I love it
B00F87ZUYG,Patricia Doherty,5,Gripping!  The chosen are turned out of Eden.  The characters are beset by a swine flu and have to forage forAntibiotics again.  A vengeful character from the past resurfaces bent on their destruction.
B00F87ZUYG,Patrick Highers,5,On the edge of your seat waiting for more and yet not really wanting to look. Never thought I would be looking forward to another season about Zombies but I am.
B00F87ZUYG,Ruth in Salt Lake City,5,Character development and acting seem to be the focus of this season. There is still plenty of gore to go around but we are beginning to get more of the back stories of characters not in the comic series.
B00F87ZUYG,Saint Louis "Chick",1,Dear Amazon Digital Services....i just got billed for this video even though I had bought the pas for this entire season of Walking Dead.  Do you LIKE double-billing people?
B00F87ZUYG,Shadhawk,5,Always entertaining and fun to watch. Fills the inner zombie cravings and is a good topic around the water cooler
B00F87ZUYG,Sharon L. Markatan "sherry",5,I've been a fan of the walking dead since the beginning.i just had to get rid of my cable service so it's good to know I can watch it on amazon prime.Day later but better then never.
B00F87ZUYG,shaz,5,Best show ever- gets better every week- love seeing the softer side of michon  would recommend this series to anyone !
B00F87ZUYG,Sherry "trying in ohio",5,Great story for the most part. always look forward to next weeks episode. Love the character interaction and more zombies this year!
B00F87ZUYG,shopalot,5,This season is very melodramatic. Lots of conversation instead of action. Lots of reminiscing and contemplating ..it's missing it's oomph!!
B00F87ZUYG,Southerns Belle,4,I am not a fan of horror movies. But you just can't help but watch. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors are amazing and their wardrobe and make up is exceptional..  thumns up.. Still shaking inmy boots though :)
B00F87ZUYG,Striker69,4,A great show most of the time. But Season 4 in parts was so slow it was like I was watching a mime. Plus they stretched out the prison crap for a whole other half season lap. Still the last episode more than makes up for the slow ones that were done. Some great zombie fun.
B00F87ZUYG,Sunny,3,So over Rick this season.  There is something thats lacking big time.  At this point I'm giving it 1 more time and if it doesn't getany better I'm giving it up.
B00F87ZUYG,susan,4,it is well liked by most of my 3 sons and one of their wives i have not got into it my self but they like it its a weekly accurance on my bill
B00F87ZUYG,S. Warren,5,For Zombie lovers everywhere.  Not really a family show unless your ages of maybe 15 and up.  Good story like and great characters and a writer who can keep the audience wonder who is next to die and where is this good characters going to do with the new situations at hand.
B00F87ZUYG,S. Yu,5,Great show!  Zombies!! Guns!! People killing zombies with guns!! Zombies killin people with Nyum Nyums!!! People killing people because they are bad people.  Sounds like real life minus the zombies!!
B00F87ZUYG,Timothy Black,5,I love The Walking Dead Season 4. I can't believe the killed off Herschel. I can't wait until the Mid-Season starts back on February 9th!
B00F87ZUYG,VeggieLover,5,Zombie shows just don't get any better than The Walking Dead! Season 4 is packed with so many surprises at every turn. This is an intense season of WD.
B00F87ZUYG,walrus,5,Absolutely...by far the BEST dead theme show/movie ever. EVER!  EVER!  EVER! Completely addicted from day one. No cable since season 2 faithfully pay to watch since.
B00F87ZUYG,wrighthinkingman,5,This is a brilliant show and it explores the many complex sides of people and personalities and how they react in catastrophic situations.This show shouldn't end this season but should go on beyond the original cast into the future.
B00F87ZUYG,w.ri,5,I loved the new direction after they left the prison.  Karl is getting more and more interesting.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00F87ZUYG,zzdb,4,The Walking Dead has started a movement. It has ushered in the era of mainstream zombies and each new season keeps you on the edge of your seat and completely engulfed in the characters. I have given this 4 stars instead of 5 because it is more of the same. They need to push the envelope just a tad further and introduce some new conflict to regain some subtle lost momentum.
B00F88GORM,Amy,5,It is a great true crime show.  Love how they try to close cold cases no matter how long they have been open.
B00F88GORM,Jorge,4,I love the fact that cold cases are always being investigated and all the power of law brought to try to bring justice to them.  This is a great team and it is fascinating to watch part of the process.  I hope in later episodes and seasons there will be follow up stories regarding any trials.
B00FBM25W8,BARBARA RICOTTA,5,EVERYBODY PLAYS THERE PART WELL. COARSE AM WAITING FOR HER AND WADE TOO HAVE A SECRET AFFAIR.. LOL THANK YOU
B00FBM25W8,Brendan Ferraro "ferraro38",5,I like to show very much it keeps you in suspense he keeps you wondering if her and Wade I'm going to get back together I think they should
B00FBM25W8,JJ,4,This show seems to be getting better!  Some how getting rid of Lemon has made it more palatable!  Now all we have to do get around Zoe's antics!  Now that Joel is in the scene  the show seems to be getting better!  Hope the shows keep improving!
B00FBM25W8,June,5,I love the show......it's got great interaction with the cast & the writers keep the script in true Southern fashion. It truly is a breath of fresh air.
B00FBM25W8,Lizs Home Made,5,This is a wonderful show. I have seen all the seasons and really enjoy this show. It leaves you with a good feeling. The characters have real life problems of love and work. I highly recommend this show.
B00FBM25W8,Mary Spangler,5,it is a show that started out slow but soon captured my heart with the quirky characters. I do feel like Zoe Hart for being a New York Doctor transplanted in the south is a bit to whiney and needy .. seems not a plausible character in the scheme of things. However the other characters  are so humorous  that you just over look it and  wait for the next show to happen.. It makes me smile every week. Keep it coming.
B00FBM25W8,MM,5,Sorry to hear that the season is in its last leg. I really enjoy this quirky little show.To bad they always take off the good clean entrainment
B00FBM25W8,M Parker,4,One of my favorite television series.  Just can't get enough of Hart of Dixie. I really enjoy watching the series over and over.
B00FBM25W8,susan,3,i loved the first 2 seasons but this new season has well not held my attention i dont care what happens to the weird new yorker boyfriend i am not impressed i watched several episodes but i just couldnt get back the desire to watch this season i might try later but really ditch the boyfriend one new yorker in dixie is enough
B00FBMQ68M,Heather Hintz,1,It is not the same without  -A and the pretty girls. I got bored with episode one. Should I give it more of a chance?
B00FBMQ68M,Kaylis,5,As a spin off from  television show Pretty Little Liars it is a tale spun well. I really enjoy watching this show with my teenager (or without). If you didn't care for it's parent show don't hold it against Ravenswood because I far as I can tell it doesn't have all that much to do with the show and certainly is written better. I don't like It's parent show (P.L.L.) much but this one has caught my attention. Worth checking out in my opinion.
B00FBMQ68M,Scmeemaw "Scmeemaw",3,I did not like how the spin off from Pretty Little Liars came about. The split between Hannah and Caleb. Hannah allowing him to stay in Ravenswood to help Miranda find her relatives. Then he returns to Rosewood and let's her believe they are over in trying to protect her from the secrets in Ravenswood. Now Miranda is dead and her spirit is roaming the earth for the other four friends to see is a little silly. Pretty Little Liars has more drama and mystery. Maybe Ravenswood will pick up the pace in the next few episodes. It is a wait and see kind of thing. It is hard for spin off shows to build momentum.
B00FBMQ68M,Stephanie Pass "tiptoefairy",5,This is a much scarier show than PLL with evilness and little girl's heads who turn completely backwards and lots of scary ghosts. Love it!!
B00FBMQ68M,Tagsmom,1,Im not at all impressed with this seris. I have watched 2 episodes and that was enough. Its just not  interesting i love Pretty Little Liars but RW is not adventerous or even interesting its almost like everything is forced and the acting is forced also bottom line Caleb needs to leave  Ravenwood!
B00FC3K3UW,AllMyShelties "AllMyShelties",5,I didn't think I would like this as much as Home Improvement... I was wrong! I actually like it more. The youngest daughter and his boss are absolutely hilarious. All the characters are great and the stories are entertaining and leave you with a smile on your face.
B00FC3K3UW,B. Merrill,5,This show is hilarious. I love Tim Allen he truly plays a great part in this show. The writers have done an amazing job creating situations to make all of its cast shine. If you want to just crack up and watch a heart warming family comedy I encourage you to watch this show.
B00FC3K3UW,Dan Hertel,5,great show love the story all I want to know is what happen to the original chrisy love back and forth banter
B00FC3K3UW,James Brittain "Jim Briton",5,I have not laughed out loud when watching a series since Seinfeld.  It is absolutely hilarious and very well written. Highly recommend.
B00FC3K3UW,raten51,5,Tim Allen is so funny on this show and so are his wife and daughters and the owner of the store is also very funny . It's a must see show.
B00FC3K3UW,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,If you enjoyed 'Tim the Toolman' you will love this show as well.  This time Tim Allen is the father of three girls and happily married to an archeologist.  Tim Allen is in fine form in this show and his usual funny self.  Entertaining and not too heavy.  Highly recommended.
B00FC3K3UW,S. Guerin,5,Tim Allen's sequel to his previous sitcom is a treat! The cast is great all for yours and my entertainment!Love 'em!
B00FD1SQY8,B. Merrill,5,This is one of the best shows ever written it is crazy funny. I have watched this series since day one. I have never been disappointed. It just makes you laugh..
B00FDMV7IY,Brenda A. Keller "dog lover",3,I've watched this show from the very beginning and liked it a lot.  This season did not hold my attention for even 2 episodes.  It's so boring.
B00FDMV7IY,James Brittain "Jim Briton",2,If a chef disagrees with the judges - the judges hold grudges and get rid of them.  It is a very biased show and based on that not very enjoyable to watch.
B00FDWGMIE,Amanda,5,I actually just started watching the mentalist a few months ago. I started at season 1 and was able to catch up to season 6 before it got to the finale. I absolutely fell in love with the show and storyline. Simon Baker is an outstanding actor and is very entertaining to watch. Season 6 is the best season by far. Can't wait for Season 7.
B00FDWGMIE,Amazon Customer,4,I'm still trying to figure out this season...is it over or are we going to see more Patrick Jane???  Please don't take him away from us:)
B00FDWGMIE,Anthony J Perri,5,The Mentalist revolves around the charm and charisma of Simon Baker..but with the end of the Red John storyline it is good to see the show take a new and lighter tone...somewhat sad to see some familiar characters leave
B00FDWGMIE,babs,5,The show has a wonderful cast.  Along with the story line it offers some subdue humor in the Simon Baker role as Patrick Jane.
B00FDWGMIE,BDI "Book reviewer",5,The Mentalist has an unusual plot twist that makes you eager to see the next episode.  The Inner personal relationships between the investigating team is a good one.
B00FDWGMIE,Brus V,5,Avid fan of the show.  We like the new turn the show has taken putting the detectives in the midst of the stodgy FBI.  Makes for great fun.
B00FDWGMIE,carrie,5,HOW NOW FINALLY KISS YAY GO JANE AND THERESA BUT ..HE REALLY SHOWS WAY ITS NOT HARD TECHNIQUES AREN'T BAD I GOT KID BETTER
B00FDWGMIE,Dave W,5,Still keeping my loyalty to this show...but I would hope the writers can come up with new variations of plot for Patrick Jane.
B00FDWGMIE,Dona L. Sears "searsgig",5,great to have this fill in the shows I missed
B00FDWGMIE,Evelyn,5,This show is just fun.  The main character's antics are interesting and funny.  I would hate to see it discontinued.
B00FDWGMIE,G8rMom7 "Allison B.",5,This season sure has been a roller coaster ride!  Sort if like 3 seasons in one. I have to hand it to the creative team though because through it all the characters have all remained consistent. It's one if the few shows where you don't yell at the screen saying "but he would never say that!" Or "she would never do that!"  In any case the ending of the Red John storyline was very satisfying. Personally I would have enjoyed seeing Patrick on the island more but that's just because I like the way he looked in that episode. But Simon Baker looks good even in the worst situations so it's all good. I've never been a shipper for Jane and Lisbon but I bought into it finally in the finale. Part of the reason I got the whole season is I wanted to watch all the episodes again leading to the finale so I could watch Jane's realization about her come to light.
B00FDWGMIE,Holly S. Porter,5,love this show and The Guardian acting is excellent and love the character he plays-miss his blue teacup! Please renew it
B00FDWGMIE,Keats,3,fell downhill quite a bit as a show. Went from my favorite to just 'meh'
B00FDWGMIE,Linda A. Flora,5,Super season
B00FDWGMIE,mary ruth,5,What other show allows us into the mind of one so touched by tragedy as the Mentalist? It is a rare show and very well done. The supporting cast is also amazing!
B00FDWGMIE,NormaJean James,5,Have watched this show since it first aired.  Very interested in finding out how Jane will &#34;fit in&#34; with the FBI.
B00FDWGMIE,North Texas Girl,3,For me the chemistry is gone.  I'm really sad about it too.  This was my very favorite show.  I hope the studio reads this and chooses better scripts. The new FBI storyline is a total snoozer and the personality of the FBI woman is like cardboard. I nearly turned Black Helicopters off before the end.  I'll buy one more episode and if it's boring then I'll stop watching.
B00FDWGMIE,Randi Houts,5,one of my favorite showsthough it deals with deathand the red john theme was a little creepyit never got as creepy as criminal mindsgood character development between lead actors
B00FDWGMIE,William E. Rice,5,They have done an excellent job transisitioning from &#34;vested&#34; Jane to not and away from the Red John tar baby to more varying plots with more depth.
B00FDZ2BEU,JH,5,I like the whole process of screening a chef and have learned so much about the restaurant business. I also like Ann in this series. She is more of a mentor and coach and seems to care about the chefs as well as the owners. She shows a tad bit of softness which I like.
B00FDZ8S2O,casanne,5,I love this show it comes from a totally new perspective of ghost hunting. They seem to be empathetic to the problem  clients face on a daily basis instead of sensstionalising and preying upon what seems to be terrible things that are happening to people.
B00FDZ8S2O,ChrisJ,5,Very entertaining and interesting show.  So glad it's available on Amazon Instant for viewing.  Love the historic places that are featured in a lot of episodes.
B00FDZ8S2O,Judith "Judith Beck",5,I liked the research they did on the places. It was interesting and done in a really unique style compared to other shows like it. It was interesting to hear about the history of the places. I found most of it believable but it is for entertainment. I would recommend watching this if you like the other ghost shows.
B00FDZ8S2O,L. Greene,5,The way this show is produced leaves me fascinated and captivated throughout.  Switching from the research to the walk through is fantastic and I really enjoy seeing how it's all going to work out.
B00FDZ8S2O,NVanPutt,2,This show was a little too bizarre for me. If this woman was actually able to speak with the spirit world then why in the world wouldn't she simply ask the people coming out of the walls how they got there or speak with the children about how they died. Her detective partner did more work by visiting the local library and the neighbors then she did by standing in the basement making guesses and explaining she doesn't feel well.
B00FDZ8S2O,Shelley Danica Black "Race it & take it!!!",5,I love the hands on investigator part of the show & the gifted psychic part of the show. They collaborate so well! Did they only do 1 season of this incredible show? I have "Dead Files Medium vs Detective Collection 1 but there are 2 DVD's for the collection! I want to find the other DVD to complete season 1. I love the dynamic!
B00FDZ8S2O,Wellred_2 "Carol",5,I loved the show when it was on TV and will continue to watch the reruns. This however was NOT 'The Dead Files Revisited' as your picture shows. A follow up on the previous shows would have been nice to fine out if the clients followed through with the advice given.
B00FDZPC46,B. E. Harkins "Billy in South Ga",5,Loved watching the old series in my youth. This is not only modern cartoon but also the characters have aged a few years to give an updated look at the episodes.
B00FDZPC46,Desiree Merrick,5,Not watered down and the characters are still true to their 1963 personalities eventhough the appearance has changed slightly.  If you were a fan if JohnnybQuext as a kid this new series is for you.
B00FDZPC46,Larry Parker,5,And this carries own the tradition nicely. For the best that HB did this makes it close to the top of my list.
B00FDZPC46,Pamala Pickard,5,I was happy to find a continuation of Jonny Quest.  I think I like this one better than the first one.
B00FEAY0FM,CornDawg,4,One of my favorite shows on HGTV. Neat to see the inside of homes ranging in prices. Pretty eye opening how house costs vary around the country.
B00FEAY0FM,Dawn Clark,5,This show is addictive!  We are able to see so many homes from different cities!  We also are able to see what was most important to the ones who are purchancing the home they chose!  Such a variety of reasons and places we are taken to is what keeps me watching the seasons!  Hop in and take a look!
B00FEAY0FM,rmkjbg6,5,Love every episode of House Hunters that I have watched!  Except this morning I clicked on my Amazon Instant Video to watch another season and now they are no longer free for Amazon Prime Members.  Makes me very sad.  I guess I wont be watching any more episodes.
B00FEAY0FM,Stephen M. Geraci "Steve-o",5,This is a great show and this was a great episode.  Even at 49 years old I still have to remind myself to never judge a book by it's cover.  When I saw the beginning I took the wife as a snobish rich wife and the husband as this rich mafia type.  I saw her walking with her little dog and bleached blonde hair and him in the cigar shop and I knew I would not like them.  Well once the show started I felt ashamed on how judgmental I was and how likable this family actually was.  The wife was very attractive and also very nice.  She was budget minded and seemed like she had a good heart.  The husband was also a very nice guy who worked hard for where he got and seemed like he appreciated all of it.  This family along with their three sons really impressed me and I'm glad I keep learning to never judge a book by its cover.  By the end I had a crush on the wife and wanted the husband as a best friend.
B00FEAY4XU,Rita Crenshaw,5,I love watching this program. I love to see what the chiefs come up out of the weird and sometimes strange ingredients.
B00FEAY4XU,Runs with Scissors,5,Incorporating lobster and a gingerbread house in a meal is unheard of yet chefs find a way to pull it off!
B00FEAYDPO,Alice,5,We chose this show to get ideas how to decorate the kitchen in our house. We really like how they put their ideas together and how they designed the kitchen. I would recommend to anyone who like to remodel their homes. Great Show
B00FEAYDPO,G.M.,5,This show is good to watch to give you ideas if you are thinking about remodeling or moving into a new house.  I just love looking at other people's kitchen.  This is like the video version of pinterest!
B00FEAYDPO,Rodger B. Terrey "jeeping rodg",5,AWESOME  SHOW!!!!! I DON'T HAVE CABLE OR SATELLITE TV.....TO GET THIS SHOW...SO WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON PRIME IT WAS A NO BRAINER!!!!!!....GOOD SHOW.....I USED BE A SUBCONTRACTOR ON KITCHEN RELATED STUFF&THIS ALMOST COVERS EVERY ASPECT OF RED IS OF IT.
B00FEAZPSS,Charity1230 "Charity",5,I love Anthony Bourdain and I love the premise of the show.  He is very funny and encourages the audience to see travel and destinations differently than the norm.
B00FEAZPSS,Happy Flamingo,5,We love our anthony the bad boy. He tell an awesome story and his perspective on the food and travel is so unique i feel like i'm right there with him
B00FEAZPSS,John P. Bradford "Angelophile",2,I used to enjoy Anthony Bourdain but now he has become like a re run of himself but in a different place.
B00FEAZPSS,Mr. Diaz,3,good but I have seen better from this show keep it coming though but you should try less fating food
B00FEB0212,Cristina Hiatt,5,Zak and nik and Aaron are such good investigators.  Their evidence is really compelling. The spirit box really seems to work.
B00FEB0212,hidden,5,This is a show that my wife and I truly enjoy.  We'll watch episode after episode until we realize there are no more to watch.  My wife will then watch them over again.
B00FEB0212,readinglarge,5,Out of all the ghost hunter shows out there this is my favorite because instead of a big build up to nothing these 3 guys actually produce evidence by the end of the show and they go places others haven't been.check them out they have fun and it's not boring.
B00FEB06WM,B. J. LARKIN "The Beej",4,Basic series..nice to see without commercials.  Have enjoyed several episodes of this fun series - if you like Chopped then take advantage of the fact that its now on Amazon Prime
B00FEB06WM,Eric J. Fridman "ejf302",5,I have always been a fan of this show.  I was so happy to see it on the Kindle.  The picture and sound quality are excellent and I thoroughly enjoy watching it.
B00FEB06WM,Jacob Crampton,5,It is very fun to see what these chefs can do with a set number of ingredients and a limited amount of time.
B00FEB06WM,Joan Richardson,5,This show is always entertaining and suspenseful.  The ingredients in the baskets are so random....I am always amazed what talented chefs can make of of them.
B00FEB06WM,John C Miller,4,Take a bunch of what are low level cooks (can not call them chefs) and put them in the high pressure world of culinary chefs and you have the makings of a good show that removes the chaff from the wheat.
B00FEB06WM,Lurch,5,Again this show gets better and better.  I am not a cook but the show always makes you think and facinates you with the skills and ideas peaple can come up with when the chips are down.  You will enjoy this if for no other reason to learn what weird foods are out there in the world and what you can do with them.
B00FEB06WM,Melinda H. Hansen "MS Warrior",5,Most entertaining cooking show!  Doesn't drag out for episodes and episodes to name the champion.  Four contestants start and winner named at end of show.  PLEASE get all the seasons and put them as PRIME eligible.
B00FEB06WM,Rita Crenshaw,5,I love watching chopped. I wish I could  get these on DVD.It makes you think just what kind of foods you can put together to make a meal.
B00FEB0FFU,Dave C. Omeara,5,Easily the best foodie show our there! Guy goes to out of the.way places that have refined their art over decades. All of food could be considered extreme comfort food. Guy gets the places to show how to make three items and then a bit about the actual restaurant and how recipes came into play.my daughter and I watch this show religously. I think families fall into a Menu rutt and this show also shows what what can be done at home.
B00FEB0FFU,K'ann Strohl,5,Guy goes to so many different places. It let's me see what is out there. The food ideas are wonderful.
B00FEB0FFU,Keith A. Hartshorn,5,Guy is a wonderful host.  He makes you want to go visit these places to taste some of their mouth watering foods.
B00FEB0FFU,KEN,5,Seeing where he is finding out of the way places with god food. Never knew when you may be there.
B00FEB0FFU,Wendy Johnson "Imcyked",5,I LOVE this show. Good variety and Guy makes you want to find and share your own special food haunts. Great interaction with all the folks at each stop. Episodes are short and sweet. I have trouble watching just one.
B00FEC4B54,Amazon Customer "DJC041003",4,Great season! Love the fact they are together and it hasn't taken away from the plots or working relationship between them.
B00FEC4B54,amrbilly,5,it was wonderful show and I love the writer created a new advanture for both of them. it was worth to watch that show!
B00FEC4B54,Athena,5,Maybe I am confused but the last episode available this season seems to be November 25th. Surely this isn't the end of the season? Anyone know what's up? Thanks!!
B00FEC4B54,Bette Self,1,I enjoyed the relationship between Castle & Beckett. I really enjoyed the show where Castle's father showed up. The show where Ryan and his wife was also very good.
B00FEC4B54,Carlos Sullivan,5,Great show if you like Nathan Fillion.  It is infused with his sense of humor and fun and some pretty interesting mysteries as well.
B00FEC4B54,C. D. Simmons "Doug Simmons-Old Timer",5,Let's see the completion of the series and cut out the continual sisasters.
B00FEC4B54,Donna Regan,5,There are two solid reasons why this show has a loyal fan base: well developed characters presented by great actors; and interesting stories with involving plot lines by exceptional writers.
B00FEC4B54,helenredhawk,5,I love this show and it keeps getting better every season. The writers have slowly built the characters to where they are now. I can't wait until the wedding!
B00FEC4B54,John,5,One of the best shows on television.  Had to have seen it from season one in order to really get into it.  Think I like the show?
B00FEC4B54,Kate "OhNo",5,This show is super...the actors are super and I like the plots involved.  Very entertaining.  A definite A plus show..
B00FEC4B54,MacGyver's "Swiss Army Knife",5,One of the best series ever.  Worth the $ and time I have invested.  Great writing and acting from every cast member.
B00FEC4B54,Otis H. McNutt "Hyrule's Savior",5,This is the season Six years in the making. After all the Will they or won't they's it is evident that yes they in fact will. #CaskettLives
B00FEC4B54,Page 2,4,I hope they continue with this series. It has great chemistry. Castle and Becket are like William powel and Merna Loy.
B00FEC4B54,Patricia M. Brown,5,I really like Castle and have since the 1st episode of the 1st season. I own all of them and this season is one of my favorites. I 've watched and waited for Castle and Beckett to get together and this season is great. Well worth the money as I love to rewatch all of the episodes from season 1 thru 6.
B00FEC4B54,Patricia Wollweber,5,Have watched every eposide since season 1.  Love that Beckett and Castle are now engaged.  They are still every bit as funny on this season as in the past even though they are engaged.  Hope this shows continues for many years.  Never get tried of Ryan and Episoto.  Just wish the mom and daughter weren't quite as involved.
B00FEC4B54,Peggy Carey,5,Best show ever on TV.  Movie &#34;Serinity&#34; ties it all up perfectly.  Watch shows 3-4 times all ready.  Perfect with movie.
B00FEC4B54,pops95b,1,THIS EPISODE WAS SO BORING I CLEANED HOUSE WITH IT ON IN THE BACKGROUND! THEY ARE RUINING MY FAVORITE SHOW WITH THIS D.C CRAP. AND WHY DO THEY THING CASTLE OR BECKETT HAVE TO BE ON DEATHS DOOR IN EVERY EPISODE NOW? WHERE ARE THE LAUGHS? AND WHERE THE HECK ARE RYAN AND ESPO!???
B00FEC4B54,Randi Houts,5,love the showfunnylove how Esposito & Ryan interactlove seeing Susan Sullivan in great clothesglad they made the Martha Roger character less aunty mamelove how castle and beckett interactgreat series
B00FEC4B54,Rene',3,I watch this show for Nathan Fillon cause I really don't care that much for Beckett.  I love the relationship Castle has with his daughter and mother.
B00FEC4B54,Saskia L. Cohick,5,Love this show.  Took a coworker talking me into watching it the first time but after a few episodes I was hooked.  But I wonder why Nathan Filion keeps putting on weight - while Stan a stays pencil thin....almost too thin.  Perhaps he needs to fear how 'ruggedly handsome' he won't be if he keeps eating those middle of the night ice cream treats.  I don't a gone there is telling a model she's too thin.
B00FEC4B54,South Pole Cat "SP Cat",3,A poor detective who changes her dress five times per episode and cow eyed writer solve crimes.... Mediocre at best.
B00FEC4B54,sybille ziegler,5,Despite the fact that the writers now have the main characters being a &#34;couple&#34; after a lot of anticipation during a few seasons if they do get together or not the writers kept it exciting as it ever was ! What I love about Castle is the good portion of humor and fun they combine with the dark side of a murder plot . Keep going ABC - this show just rocks!
B00FEC4B54,T. Bloom "Accountant 101",5,I think this show is always fun to watch. The actors obviously like each other and work well together to make this show enjoyable.
B00FEC4B54,THOMPSON,5,ALL EPISODES WERE GREAT. WAITING ON THE NEXT SEASON.
B00FEC4B54,victor,5,The writing is fun. the actors and cast are phenomenal. It is a good show that any age can enjoy.
B00FEEQVUK,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I laugh so hard when I'm watching this show that my husband tells me that wearing headphones isn't enough when I'm watching it on my Kindle Fire!
B00FEEQVUK,Becky,5,I'd rate this show a 5 star.  These 2 girls are trying to get up and out of their world into a new one.
B00FEEQVUK,David Asensio,5,Five stars it's one of the funniest sitcom on tv now it will literally have you laughing out loud it's a show worth watching enjoy
B00FEEQVUK,NO CO Bear,4,Fun (even though somewhat too naughty for my tastes) characters. It's great to see Garrett Morris getting a regular gig and he is as funny as ever. I've always liked him!
B00FFV9VAO,Amanda,5,The funniest show out right now in my opinion.  Great show to watch with the family and really depicts how different the &#34;modern family&#34; is from what it used to be.
B00FFV9VAO,Cynthia J. Sanborn "Charlie's girl",5,This is the best show on television in that addresses some serious issues like prejudices and stereotypes but with an ability to laugh at the frailties and foibles of of humanity.  The characters are real and the acting is top notch.
B00FFV9VAO,Elizabeth T. Epperson,5,Five seasons in and this show is better and better. Love that they bring the kids into the family dynamic so much and LOVE Ty Burrell.
B00FFV9VAO,Julius Weber,3,It is watchable but very contrived and brings on the yarns. The story lines are feeble and the characters weak.
B00FFV9VAO,Laer Carroll,5,Makes me laugh even the second and third times around.  We always buy the DVDs even though we watch the show when aired.
B00FFV9VAO,Traveling1,5,Funny and believable! This season has good continuing character development and I'm glad to see more realistic plots (not so many &#34;Lucy & Ethel&#34; scenarios).
B00FFV9ZBY,AllMyShelties "AllMyShelties",5,Interesting characters and storylines. I always look forward to each new episode. And the costumes and songs are great too!!
B00FFV9ZBY,Brian Jones,5,The only reason I started watching this is because I loved Friday Night Lights.  Connie Britton has the same strong and kind character in Nashville.  I like it.
B00FFV9ZBY,dana wall,5,I love every minute of this show and am bummed when it's over every week! You can't find more talented actors or writing.
B00FFV9ZBY,Dena,5,I am completely addicted to these characters and their struggles.  The characters are larger than life without being unrealistic. Great show and great music (and I am not a country music fan).
B00FFV9ZBY,Helen Thomas,5,This is one of the best quality shows on TV.  I really truly cannot wait for next season to start
B00FFV9ZBY,JJ,5,This show has progressed wonderfully!  The music is real!  The action is good.  There is not a lot of violence!  No gore what so ever!  There are at least 3 or 4 plots going on all the time!  Wow a show the whole family can watch together.
B00FFV9ZBY,Joy "JTS",5,Finally a fabulous story and great music!!! I own the CD's and enjoy them all the time.  Great cast and twists
B00FFV9ZBY,Lisa,5,who knew i would love country music so much? that's what keeps me coming back. it has gotten a little soap-opera
B00FFV9ZBY,Megan,5,I thought Season one was incredible but season two blew it out of the water! I hated waiting a week just to see what was going to happen next!
B00FFV9ZBY,M. Kennedy,5,Music is great and I find myself rooting for characters.  It can play in the background while I'm doing other things and doesn't detract from my other activities.
B00FGLYZKO,Adam,5,I started watching last season and jumped right in and understood what was going on. I'd suggested this to anyone.
B00FGLYZKO,Amazon Customer,4,This hasn't been my favorite season of Grey's but it's still totally worth watching. I'm sad to hear that Sandra Oh will be leaving after this season.
B00FGLYZKO,Bacon,4,My wife watched this and continues to watch it. Never seen it and don't care. She does complain sometimes about how they have &#34;changed&#34; to much or something. So I guess 4 stars? I dunno
B00FGLYZKO,Deborah Jones,5,Using Amazon Instant Video allowed me to catch up on the episodes in the 10th season that I missed but wanted to see before the others.
B00FGLYZKO,D. Moore "Dano",5,I love the show.. But they need to get the medical part going again....I have prime.. But I see you must pay for this also....About time to drop prime...
B00FGLYZKO,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,Awesome show. I am totally addicted to this show.  I had not ever watched it until this year.  However with amazon prime i got to catch up on all of the episodes.
B00FGLYZKO,Linda Smith "Ellis",5,This season is just as good as the previous ones. The characters are well-presented and given lots of opportunities to showcase their abilities. I love this show.
B00FGLYZKO,Lizs Home Made,5,I have seen every single episode of Grey's Anatomy! I love this show. There is always a new twist to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this show!! It gets a five star plus!
B00FGLYZKO,Neelahofnafia,5,LOVED WATCHING THIS SERIES ON MY KINDLE. SORRY IT'S OVER. SORRY TO SEE CHARACTERS LEAVE BUT LOVED PATRICK DEMPSEY AND ELLEN POMPEO AND THEIR HAPPY MARRIAGE.
B00FGLYZKO,Penny Tunnell,5,Tons of changes and surprises in this season! New characters and storylines! Great purchase! Excellent viewing quality on the kindle!
B00FGLYZKO,sharron reader "SPEED READER",1,I RENTED A FEW EPISODES AND WAS BILLED FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON WHICH I WATCHED ON HULU !  WHY IS AMAZON NOT TAKING CARE OF THERE CUSTOMERS ANYMORE?????? I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THEY STIPPED CARING!
B00FGLYZKO,Twilight Mom,5,I have watched Grey's Anatomy from season 1...and own each season downloaded on my Kindle Fire.
B00FGLYZKO,txjaywalker,5,Grey's Anatomy Season 10 was great and actually an improvement over some of the previous seasons.  The medical story line continues to present interesting cases w/ cutting edge medical treatment while containing just enough love interest to make the episodes full and worth watching!
B00FGLYZKO,William E. Rice,5,Not sure how they do it but they keep characters varied and complex while moving the story in so many directions. Can't stop watching!
B00FGN2HZW,JT,5,Need I say more? Awesomely consistent show that keeps me laughing to this day. Anyone who likes comedy can appreciate this show
B00FGN2HZW,Tara "Tara",5,I watch a lot of shows here on Amazon and found this one to be very entertaining.  I do find that I need to be in a certain mood to watch South Park though because sometimes I laugh and other times it is just blah.  The humor is adult oriented and certainly not safe for kids - which makes it all the better.
B00FGNDU3U,Sherrie McGovern "Sherrie",3,I must have but totally do mot remember it. That is really telling as a memorable movie will stock with me forever and will usually become a purchase.
B00FIZIY3M,Amazon Customer,5,LOVE...Why have we not seen Madeleine Stowe on TV before??  She is amazing...she and Gabriel Mann steal the show every week.
B00FIZIY3M,Amazon Customer,4,revenge season 3 definitely out ranks season 2 you are on the edge of your chair with every episode. wow
B00FIZIY3M,april,5,Revenge is the only show right now that I never miss!  The characters are so intriguing and different.  I love love love Nolan!!  I wish they could come up with a way to continue the show with these characters without the continuing revenge but that would be no Grayson's therefore no show..too bad!
B00FIZIY3M,Bertha Scoggins,5,I was happy to see the end of some of the Grayson's; what a twist to have Victoria is the same hospital that Amanda was placed in as a child and to see the new actors added. Hopefully ABC will continue this series and not drop it like so many times happens to great shows. I like less sexual shows and more symbolic story lines.
B00FIZIY3M,B. Merrill,5,I love this show. The cast is amazing the villains are perfect and the good guys are perfect for the characters they play. If you like to see Justice served this show is amazing. Great story line of a someone framed for a crime they didn't commit and how everyone interacts to have their own vengeance.
B00FIZIY3M,Carlos A. Hermida "Carlos",5,Excellent series. Very entertaining. A must see.
B00FIZIY3M,Carolyn Stewart "Can't get enough arty stuff",5,Emily is getting too consumed in it all and has forgotten to live!Hate can only get you so far..just sayin'.
B00FIZIY3M,ccc,4,was suprising and cant wait to find out more information and see what happens with the rest of the story.
B00FIZIY3M,Cory,5,I absolutely love all the Revenge Seasons and it keeps getting better and better! You never know what to expect! :)
B00FIZIY3M,D. M. McGrue "Lady D",5,This show has been great right from the first episode.  The actors/actresses were really well cast.  The script is well written and contains enough revenge to keep you coming back for more.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00FIZIY3M,D. P. Lance,4,Loved all the Characters and evil doers in this series but it is starting to wear thin with  one dimensional characters. But the cast is doing the best it can with the material supplied. I know it's hard to believe but they are all believable.  Sure glad that they are not my neighbors.
B00FIZIY3M,Isabeau,3,It's run it's course and needs to end.  I only gave it 3 stars because the performances are good... the storyline is just dull.
B00FIZIY3M,I. T. L. Hall,3,I love Revenge and find most episodes to be deserving of at least 3 or 4 stars.  Ready for it to be done though.
B00FIZIY3M,Jannieknows "Jannie",5,I looked forward to each and every episode on this show.  It just got better and better and I cannot wait for more.  Love the twists and turns.  You will be hooked if you watch one episode.  Trust me.  :)
B00FIZIY3M,J. Meehan "Naomi",5,I can hardly wait until the next season begins. I will be re-watching prior seasons I have on my Kindle.
B00FIZIY3M,June,5,I've loved it from the 1st episode.  They are like family to me lol. There have been some really big shockers.
B00FIZIY3M,Linda Adams,5,This is one of the best shows on TV.  Good acting and great twists and turns in the story line.
B00FIZIY3M,Marika,5,I have watched all the episodes and can't stop wondering what is going to happen to poor Emily on her mission.
B00FIZIY3M,Nancy Sutherlin,5,Revenge is about a women getting even for her /Fathers death and being put in jail for something he was not quilty of.  Constanly moving and excellent acting.
B00FIZIY3M,Norman,5,All the TV Series that are available via Amazon Prime are terrific. No commercials; excellent quality; WELL worth the reasonable price.
B00FIZIY3M,R Walsh "R .W.",4,Great show. Very suspenseful and unpredictable!! Plots and subplots keeps you guessing. Only issue is that Emily's revenge demeanor is sometimes very Obvious.
B00FIZIY3M,Sue,5,I really have enjoyed the series.  To begin with I understood her motives although with the recent episodes I am disappointed how the tale has turned.  It is still good but giving me a feeling of will it ever reach the climax when the old loves become one again or will everything be stripped away from her and those she cares about.  Hmm...only each episode will tell ; )
B00FIZIY3M,THOMPSON,5,AWAITING THE NEW SEASON OF REVENGE. THE OTHERS WERE GREAT.
B00FJ01MQC,Amazon Customer,5,This show has so much going for it.  Every fairy tale character I've ever heard of so far is incorporated into a story line!
B00FJ01MQC,Brendan Ferraro "ferraro38",5,It's a great show I really like it you should do another season two is a lot of people that I know that watch a show and like it it's a great show
B00FJ01MQC,briana tarango "Briana Tarango",4,Sunday's episode was good and very suprising.  At the end we finially know who was that boy really is he is Peter Pan after Henry.  The sea storm like wow the mermaid cast a storm and makes everyone fight each other.
B00FJ01MQC,ccc,5,can hardly wait for the new shows and will watch to the end. cant wait for the new episodes. nice.
B00FJ01MQC,C. Van Blake,5,This is a delightful new twist on all of the old fairy tails. great fun and very addictive. Highly recommended!
B00FJ01MQC,Denise Saniewski,4,I really like Season 3.  I specially enjoy the chemistry between Regina and Emma.  I think the two work really well together.  I think that the story of Emma and Hook can be really interesting.
B00FJ01MQC,G. L. Oneal,5,but where is Once upon a time in Wonderland? This is a great show for the entire family  great entertainment  great twists and turns. I love it
B00FJ01MQC,Jody Morgan "Jody A morgan",5,I think this is an interesting spin on the whole story history from Disney. It s pretty well written and if you will notice you tend to like some of the characters that are technically the antagonist of the plot.
B00FJ01MQC,Karen Robinson "Ivy",5,I love the entire series and every season just makes me want more! I can't wait to see what happens in the next season.
B00FJ01MQC,L. Carlson "lovemykindle",5,I absolutely love the series! I wait anxiously every week for the new episodes to come out. I love the twists they have created for each fairy tale and I especially like that the princesses are tough and can kick butt!
B00FJ01MQC,Michael J. Scott,5,I'm hooked on this terrific show.  It's all about fairy tales made for adults.  Highly recommended for imaginative people of all ages.
B00FJ01MQC,miss tinkerbell,5,Once Upon A Time is brilliant Emma Regina Snow (mary Margaret) David (charming) Belle Henry Mr. Gold etc all amazing I literally count the hrs til each episode cuz i'm that addicted to the show and i'm so excited its going to have season 4 cant wait
B00FJ01MQC,Nancy Jane "Lovdolls",3,This series three is taking way too much time on the island of Neverland looking for Henry. It just goes on and on wandering around that island. I'm finding myself not liking this season nearly as well as I did the first two.
B00FJ01MQC,nutriaguy,4,I began watching the series on Netflix and finally viewed each one. The premise of having the fairy tale characters from Snow White to Peter Pan transformed in real people seemed corny at first. But in the series  they are well developed and not cardboard cutouts. I look forward to watching the rest of this adventure.
B00FJ01MQC,PATRICIA COLBURN,5,excellent series -I love it -always waiting for the next episode- love it love it love it-very very good !
B00FJ01MQC,patricia,4,I liked this series. Continued watching on tv until it ended again. One thing about watching on the Kindle is that their are no commercials and you can watch as many episodes as you want at one time.
B00FJ01MQC,Regina M. Beck "Catlady2",5,Based on childhood fairy tales.  Always different and interesting.  Good casting and acting.  Centers around Snow White & Prince Charming.  They are always fighting the bad queen-Regina.  Each week is a different story based on a fairy tale.  Very entertaining.
B00FJ01MQC,Samantha English,4,Great plot and twists. I really like the character development also.
B00FJ01MQC,Vickie Staton "Quickvick",5,This show takes the Fairy Tale to a whole other level!  This season was even better; great special effects; highly recommend! Never boring!
B00FJ01MQC,Wyrdwoman,4,I can see the show starting to wind down now. I could have cut off at any time and I feel as if their starting to reach a bit with the introduction of Oz characters.  Still a good show though.
B00FJ04ZWK,Angela Anderson,5,I missed the first episode of Betrayal & was able to buy it & start watching within a minutes. I love Amazon video downloads.
B00FJN9EL4,joan,5,I have watched all 3 seasons of Awkward and can't wait for the next one.  My only complaint is the seasons are too short!
B00FJN9EL4,Kindle Customer,5,Love it..very juciy and funny :-) this season is going to be epic. So far the drama is on high and its very exciting
B00FJN9EL4,Lynne A. James "Lynne",4,Very real dramatization of issues teens face today. This demonstrates a positive way to face these issues and to be a strong woman.
B00FJN9EL4,momnson,5,Great story about high school and the crushed / loves we have.  Cute show that is pretty clean compared to most movies out there.
B00FKFGZZO,bsblurr,4,Good for a one time watch but that's about it.  Really strange movie and doesn't really make much sense.  I did enjoy the oddness of it but I definitely won't watch it again.
B00FKFGZZO,Cward55,4,I thought it was a pretty interesting flick that I enjoyed for what it was. Glad to see that someone could make something dark the revolved around Disney and showed that not everything is right in the magic kingdom. This movie is straight up psychological horror so if you don't like those kinda movies then stay away from this one. Has moments that are great but also bogs down a lot at times. Would I recommend this? Only o diehard movie fans that wanna see something different. Overall I don't think it's a great movie but I like it for what it is and that's an experiment. Check it out but be warned of its weirdness.
B00FKOYN40,Diana Wise,5,This show is a history lesson. A lesson in human nature with drama and comedy through out. It's a treasure hunt of many kinds. Worthy of more stars than five.
B00FKOYN40,D. Tinsley,5,I love this show. I like all the people featured and the view it gives of rural and small town life. It shows the small towns in a way we don't usually see. The two guys are fascinating and I love their relationship. I really like the young woman who helps them out in their Iowa store.
B00FKQRYTE,Jorge,5,Lt Joe Kenda is a good story teller with good stories to tell.  I really love true crime when they catch the bad guy and Lt Joe fills the bill.
B00FKQRYTE,Kathryn L Khanzadeh,5,I enjoyed watching Detective Kenda resolve crimes.  He is also very witty and enjoyable to listen to his story telling from his side.
B00FKQRYTE,Niki,5,LT. Kendra is no joke. He is the man!! I love this show. He tells the truth and the way he thinks is such a gift. He has solved a lot of cases that probably would not have been solved if he hadn't been the one working on them. I hope more seasons will be coming. You just have to watch to understand what I am talking about. HE IS THAT MAN!!!!
B00FKXQVI2,B. Merrill,5,I really enjoyed this show. The cast did a great job interacting. It had humor romance and action. Well worth watching.
B00FKXQVI2,Brendan Ferraro "ferraro38",5,I think it's an awesome show it is action-packed The main actors awesome. I hope they do more seasons. Great series
B00FKXQVI2,Jeannette L Bertsch,5,I didn't realize that Beauty & The Beast was a series on TV and then I saw a promo. I decided to watch it and I was hooked.  I think this is a really good show. I love the relationship that Vincent and Catherine have. They seem to be deeply in love and you can see it when they are together. They way they look at each other and the way they touch one another (it is so real). He can hear her heart beat anywhere - what an attachment. I think the story line is really a good one. Vincent/Beast with a true heart helping Catherine/Cop solve crimes. It couldn't get better then this. I think all the actors do an extremely good job. I like all the characters and their attachment to each other. I watched the first season and now I'm watching the second and boy is it worth it. I hope this show stays on for many more seasons. I look forward to it's return.
B00FKXQVI2,Kayla Lake,5,I love this show! My friend showed it to me and now I'm totally in love with it! Wonderful story too!
B00FKXQVI2,Kindle Customer "metaphor",4,It was just beginning to be than just a romantic show. Some action was just beginning!  Hope it makes it through another season!
B00FKXQVI2,K. Thomas,5,Die hard fan of beauty and the beast. This season is better than the first. I am glad the season was renewed. I hope it is extended to the full season instead of just half the shows.
B00FKXQVI2,Marlena,5,This is absolutely awesome but saddening at the same time.  Love/friendship triangle torn each and every way.  Definitely keeps your eyes glued.
B00FKXQVI2,Michael "KarateMike",5,GREAT SERIES CONTINUES TO DELIVER THE GOODS THE CHARACTERS OB THE SIDELINES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND PLOT TWIST ALWAYS KEEP YOU GUESSING
B00FKXQVI2,Miss Amanda Marie,5,Great show love the characters and the action and the love story part of it it's different from all the other vampire love story's
B00FKXQVI2,Newbee,1,Not as good as I had hoped.  Seems to have lost its appeal to me.  The only thing that I like in it is that Kat and her boss are a good fit.
B00FKXQVI2,oldladywithbcs,5,Keeps me on the edge of my chair the entire episode.  The romance certainly doesn't hurt either ! Even the nerd is lovable !
B00FKXQVI2,Paula Jankowski,5,Jay Ryan is the best looking guy I have ever seenThey make a great coupleI would love to see a season with them solving cases and making love with no one not letting them do the thing they do bestThey are better together than they are apart
B00FKXQVI2,Ray Macmeeken "Ray MacMeeken",5,I've always liked Katie Kuerk and no only do they have a great cast and guest stars the show will be on for a few more years.  It just has that chemistry that you have to watch.
B00FKXQVI2,S. Wallace,3,I like the actors and the first season and I'm watching the second season now.  So far the 2nd season dialogue is predictable.  It could pick up and I'm hoping they will find some new dialogue.
B00FL0CN4U,Jim,5,I watched it once and my friend borrowed it and he liked it also. It really tell a story great
B00FL7UCB4,Carolyn,5,I love this show. I love the era. The costumes are amazing! The story line is great so far. Don't like so much of the evil stuff though.
B00FL7UCB4,Corvin Adkins "maguscorvin",5,I normally don't go for this kind of show and yet on a whim I watched the pilot and it was all uphill from there. This show has far surpassed any expectations I could have had for it.  The performances are outstanding.  Megan Fellows alone commands you to watch every second she appears on the screen.  Now granted this is not going to be historically accurate - it is fantasy.  But week after week this show keeps me them coming - great plot points and wonderful scenery.  Yes there are moments that I wish were more fleshed out. I tend to think that is partly the editors choice and the fact there is on about 42 minutes to tell the story.  All in all I recommend this to those who enjoy drama and a little bit of fantasy all in one with great acting and wonderful sets and costumes.
B00FL7UCB4,Kady Turner,4,"How can I put this? It&#8217;s my favorite show made for the opposite gender that isn&#8217;t about ponies. Guys. I can&#8217;t really..."Read full review here:[...]
B00FL7UCB4,Magpie,4,It's a really. Good soap opera...romance....intrigue....but truth be told Queen Mary married a child...andthat is not what Reign portrays...oh well...watch it if you like soap...oh and the costumes were fun...butnot of the period.
B00FL7UCB4,M. Engel,5,I didn't want to watch this show. I accidentally watched the pilot and fell in love.  Now I buy all the episodes so that I can watch them commercial free.  I have watched them all at least 6. It never gets boring.  It romantic and exciting and who's done it all combined.  I for one love their costumes.
B00FL7UCB4,Mgriffin2312,4,I really enjoy this show :o) it's not for everyone but I love shows that are a mix between historical and fictional
B00FL7UCB4,missylyn1990 "nikki stewart",5,this show was very addictive you never new what was going to happen next and you are always wondering what is going to happen to the charctors. out of a lot of the shows that I watch this is one ofmy best ones that I watch. I would recommend it to any adult plus if you look up some of the history that happened to mary and her husband a lot of it really happened in her life.
B00FL7UCB4,pegeen,5,Best unexpected show I think I can't get enought of.  Mary is a delight.  I'm glad to see such a show without the pay per view aspect of power.
B00FL7UCB4,T. Lansburg "elecbanker",5,Great storyline about the life of Mary Queen of Scots with a great cast.  I'm not sure if this program has been cut but I hope it hasn't.
B00FMO7TSA,Crashconklin,4,good actors much in the formate of past argento's past work . was told in a manor unlike past effortes
B00FMO7TSA,Tim,3,Being a horror movie lover and a 3D lover I'm not gonna be to tough on this film.The 3D was decent with a few pop-outs.Terrible acting by the guy who played Dracula was this movies major flaw.Why Rutguer was Van Helsing and not Dracula was just plain dumb!! Anyway a ok horror movie with ok 3D and a good price so 3d lovers/horror lover might want to take a chance.
B00FMO8DXU,Amazon Customer "Nina",5,It is so much fun to watch and see where Shonda Rhimes takes this show. To outlandish places and you do have to leave your logic behind sometimes (like believing that at least 3 people in the government have committed murder).  But it is great to watch and Kerry Washington is FABULOUS
B00FMO8DXU,B. Merrill,5,I love this show and I really think it is so close to what really happens in the real world. Great show great cast and amusing new content each week although a great story line to follow through out the season and since the beginning. With that being said it is however constantly changing you really have no clue who is the good guy and who is the bad. I do have one complaint against the show and it may not bother anyone else. The writes seems to have all the characters repeat their lines to give further drama in a short they seem to repeat in an aggressive high strung manner what they are trying to say it seems all characters in this show do it to further stress their point. For instance they will say a line and change a few words repeat it to get you more riled up and it seems annoying to me. Olivia and her father do it the most but I have seen all characters do this in this show. I may be explaining it wrong but it is really annoying.
B00FMO8DXU,Bobby L. Sheppard "Shepdog",3,This was a really good show initially for the first two seasons but I think the writer is trying too hard to make it exciting and intriguing and its not. Also Olivia Pope is looking like an alcoholic. Season 2 was Emmy worthy.. this season has the viewership because of season 2 but trust me they've lost a step.
B00FMO8DXU,charismatic,5,Loving the show !! Loving the plots sub-plots etc!! Can not wait for season 4! Amazing writer Shonda Rimes!! !!!
B00FMO8DXU,Doni. Wright,5,this show is by far one of the best on TV today. I love the twist & turns and you just have to expect the unexpected. This is a great show.... love it!
B00FMO8DXU,D. P. Lance,4,OK OK that really is a recommendation. The twist and turn of plots are fun and a surprise. Looking forward to next season.
B00FMO8DXU,HistoryBuff22,5,Plot twists never end! I really like Scott Foley -- his character is developing well. I keep hoping for Huck to find his way out of his trauma and the most recent episode gives me hope that his strength and intelligence will carry him to victory. This is such a fun series -- good to watch episodes a second time to catch nuances. I have never been so hooked on a TV series.
B00FMO8DXU,Janet Gagej,5,Well written and acted.  Interesting how reality follows fiction at times.  Who writes the script for our Washington representatives?  Do they take their lines from this show?
B00FMO8DXU,Jean White,5,This new season does not disappoint! It totally remains suspenseful! All the characters are still the same and this season gives you more details about their past lives! Purchase well spent!
B00FMO8DXU,J. Meehan "Naomi",5,This show is the best on TV!!!!!! I can't hardly wait until the next episode. I hope they extend this show for another season.
B00FMO8DXU,kittie2176,5,I stumbled upon this series due to a recommendation based on my viewing history. Absolutely glued to the TV for every episode now!
B00FMO8DXU,KK,5,I was immediately hooked. Great cast and a scandalous plot make for an entertaining show! Kerry Washington is truly sensational on it
B00FMO8DXU,Lauren Michele,5,This is going to be one hell of a season.  Scandalous ROCKS!  Can hardly wait from one week to the next.
B00FMO8DXU,Linda Smith "Ellis",3,I am so tired of Olivia and her quivering lip over some man in her life letting her down again. It's getting boring.
B00FMO8DXU,Martha S. Clark,5,Cyrus and James are really funny--the supporting cast is better than the lead roles I think. All around good show.
B00FMO8DXU,M. Hays,5,This is absolutely in my top 5 favorite TV shows right now.  This is a great dramatic show with twists and turns to keep you interested.  I am always amazed at the writing and acting as it continues to keep you captivated.  I don't know who the writers are for this show but they come up with some of the best plot twists imaginable.  I gobble this up each week when it comes out and can't wait for the next episode.  Truly an addictive show.
B00FMO8DXU,mistic,5,&#34; Jake says to olivia (while holding a tight grip around her neck with his strong hand)-&#34;WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST DO?!! ........... Olivia responds &#34;I dont know what your talking about !....Jake responds &#34;YOU JUST KILLED THE PRESIDENT! OMFG WOOOOOOOOOOOO OMG OMG OMG OMG ..........and olivia's mom is craaaaaazzzzzzzyyyyyy!!!!!
B00FMO8DXU,Nancy Sutherlin,5,I give it a 5 because it is full of suspense and gives a little of the corrupt side of politics
B00FMO8DXU,Nancy Tice,5,Started watching on Netflix and got so hooked bought the 6 shows between Netflix and ABC site. Anxiously awaiting the new season premiere
B00FMO8DXU,Phyllis,5,Insane! LOVE OLIVIA POOE & ENTIRE CAST and execution.  I'm expected to write point. WATCH WATCH WATCH WHATCH WHATCH WATCH
B00FMO8DXU,Rene',4,Not sure I'm loving this season as much as the previous one but I still love Olivia and the Gladiators.
B00FMO8DXU,Southerns Belle,5,the suspense is phenominal !!!!! The writers and actors do a great job... each episode pulls you in... wonderful and original
B00FMO8DXU,southerntothecore "richard",5,I'm sure I'm not the only one that has been mesmerized by this totally over the top conspiracy laden drama. Olivia Pope and her Gladiators have broken new ground and I am enjoying the roller-coaster ride... thanks
B00FMO8DXU,Susan "Susan",5,Latest episode (Vermont is for Lovers) was high point of this season so far (exclusive of the Silence of the Lambs-like segment that was a bit over the top for effect). At last we're seeing series where the quality of story line and acting equals what we can regularly enjoy in British series. Congrats Ms. Rimes and cast.
B00FMO8DXU,Tony V,1,This show has really gone down hill fast. The storyline is getting ridiculous and convoluted. This is not the type of series that lends itself to long seasonal and mid-seasonal breaks because people forget what is going on and give up trying to follow it.  I am guessing that this will be the final season - at least it will be for me.
B00FO3XOXI,Ellen Ellis,5,Gina Gershon deserves to win many awards for her portrayal of Donatella Versace. I didn't know much about what happened after Giovani was murdered. This story was extremely interesting. All the actors did a great job!. I forgot I was watching a movie. I felt like I was watching the actual people.
B00FO3XOXI,Eric W. Hutcheson "guyseattle",1,You have to be an expert on Versace and his life to get where this movie starts and goes.  It is lame excerpt for Gina Gershon's portrayal of Donatella she does a superrb job otherwise this thing is unwatchable even for a Lifetime movie.
B00FOILB0G,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,This is worth paying for.  From what I have seen so far with this is a program directed around what most paranormal programs do not.  They go in to detail things that have taken place with unfriendly spirits.  Do hope there are many more investigations on this staffs behalf to come.  Totally watch if this area is an interest to you as it is to me.
B00FOILB0G,readinglarge,5,This show differs from the others in the fact that these are ALL nasty intruders and about as far from Casper the friendly ghost as it gets.These ghosts and entities hurt and try to kill you.if you are a fan like me of these programs by all means watch this show....lights on.
B00FOILB0G,The Working Dead,5,It's a good and entertaining program. It recounts people's stories about being menaced and attacked by ghosts. Scary stuff that's worth a watch.
B00FOILMQ4,Julie Ann,5,Season 5 is yet another winning season for Theresa. I just adore these shows as an end of day treat!
B00FOILMQ4,meg,5,I love Theresa' s enthusiasm and honesty with a dynamic love for people. I wish I had patience waiting for the new episode. I watch them all through Amazon. It would be great if they threw in 1 free one:) love your family too.  I'm still waiting for Theresa to come to Eureka California. Meg
B00FOILMQ4,tigger,5,This show is Great . Theresa has the best personality. Just wish everone could have a reading from her .
B00FOILOSU,Amazon Customer,5,I love this show!  Please keep renewing the show each season!  The characters and actors are marvelous and the story lines are great!
B00FOILOSU,Amazon Customer,5,The story lines are getting more interesting. Even though there are different story lines going on they don't seem convoluted.
B00FOILOSU,a reader,5,What a show - mythos and action !  Totally fun and you don't have to worry the bad guys lose for the most part.  Great Entertainment
B00FOILOSU,Bazajaytee "Bazajaytee",5,Been watching this show since the first series and it has only gotten more and more interesting with the development of the characters and the changes in circumstances they face. Series one started a little slow and focused more on Grimm's Fairytales link and now that link is only referenced in the opening sequence which is a shame but it also means they have more freedom to do what they want with the story.Looking forward to seeing what is coming next.
B00FOILOSU,Blue isle #3,5,My husband and I along with our son that lives with us like it very much. We enjoy the scenery where the movie is made along with each characters role. The main actor &#34;The GRIMM&#34; himself has these eyes not sure if it's enhanced  with makeup or not but just his eyes tells the story and draws you into each episode. We also especially like &#34;Monroe's&#34; character and the &#34;Captains&#34; and oh well just about everyone that is a regular along with the interesting so called bad guys/monsters.  We enjoy and look forward to each segment and cannot wait to see what happens next.
B00FOILOSU,Carl Gillberg &#34;Kamaka&#34; "Carl Gillberg",4,Not great but entertaining... You always look for the few seconds of one of the Characters to morph and reveal their true nature...
B00FOILOSU,CW FISHER "stars for connie",5,This is a very good series and I love this season you have all sorts of creatures and a lot of actions this is the Season 3 and it is living up to it previous seasons.
B00FOILOSU,David Asensio,5,love GRIMM season 3 special effects are awesome like the krumpus from episode 12 days of krumpus if you haven't already seen any episode you should storylines are well done check it out you will be glad you did
B00FOILOSU,David S. Cowan,4,Campy and fun.  Great special effects.  Nice character development.  I have enjoyed each season.  Looking forward to more seasons.  Not always kid appropriate!  Grimm is Grim.
B00FOILOSU,Dean W. Wood,5,Again another great season full if surprises. The whole cast of Grimm does a great job and the suspense is continuous.
B00FOILOSU,Debbie Dillon,5,I was never into &#34;science fiction&#34; type of shows but I love this show. Great actors and I think very well written. The characters reactions to mind boggling situations seem so real or like a person would actually respond.
B00FOILOSU,DebbieT,5,Its great to see a series that has all the elements of suspense that you love to watch in movies!!!! Its awesome!
B00FOILOSU,Denise Saniewski,4,Grimm has been one of my favored shows since its beginning.  I like Season 3 but would like to see more of Monroe instead of Julie working with Nick.  My son thinks the special effects are amazing!
B00FOILOSU,Donald G. Siering,5,this show is surprisingly awesome...always keeps me glued to the screen and Nick isnt bad eye candy either ...i want my own grimm!
B00FOILOSU,DP,5,Cool time passer. The girlfriend is annoying though :)
B00FOILOSU,Eman,5,The series is captivating and the characters are well chosen. I look forward to the seasons being made available. Watch at least two episodes before you make your descision to continue.
B00FOILOSU,Grandma Geek,5,This is one of the best programs on TV.  The scary parts are not for kids.  Finally getting some programing just for grown ups.  Great multi plot lines.  Layers of stories for people who can think excellent.
B00FOILOSU,hansbandu "hansbandu",5,This show just gets better and better.  I find the storylines fascinating and enjoy this new take on the police procedural.  I'm glad that the producers/writers aren't limiting their story possibilities to Grimm's Fairytales but are also including legends and myths from other cultures.  Keep up the good work and I hope that Grimm will be bringing us stories for many years to come.
B00FOILOSU,jay,4,Starting out better. Then last season  better story. Would. Like to know what grimm. Looks like though hopefully this season
B00FOILOSU,Jeannette L Bertsch,4,Really good and I can say I was not disappointed. I can't wait to see what happens next. Terrific series.
B00FOILOSU,jim jones,5,It has been fun to watch the show takes place in Oregon I love that because gives me chance to see parts of  my home
B00FOILOSU,Keats,5,My favorite show by far!
B00FOILOSU,Kelly Ann Talamo,5,This is a really good show if you like fantasy with a good story line.  I am totally addicted to it.
B00FOILOSU,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,This is one of my favorite supernatural shows out there new beasts not mentioned on other shows so gives it a new twist
B00FOILOSU,K.S. "Sunshine",5,It is a fantasy science fiction show which I can't miss to watch. It's really cool as there are wonderful actors and actresses in that show.
B00FOILOSU,L. Crist "tronicsjunkie",5,Unless you've watched every episode from the beginning you will not get why this show is great.  I've loved almost every episode and look forward to the next.
B00FOILOSU,M. A. Griffin,4,The season ended on a real thriller.  It left a number of situations and questions up in the air and unanswered.  Great writing and expansion of characters.  Like the local shots of Portland too.
B00FOILOSU,Melanie,5,Best show ever!
B00FOILOSU,michele symonette,5,I enjoy this series very much the characters grow and develope without becomming caritures of themselfs. my way of top rating a series is if I enjoy watching it again and this one certainly does.
B00FOILOSU,M. Surber,5,I hope to heck that this show is not canceled....this has been a fresh breeze in the normal stink of Syfy shows that is so damn refreshing....Keep coming with more episodes...this is a gem of a show.
B00FOILOSU,Northerngal,5,I have really been enjoying this series and am glad to see that it is returning for a fourth season.  I find all the characters on the show to be very interesting and look forward to watching.
B00FOILOSU,notwing,5,loiked it very much.  would go back and rerun.  then i rerun them again.  a thumbs up for grimm aT HOME
B00FOILOSU,Patricia Doherty,5,Grimmer season.  There is more determination from the characters.  The plot is developed further and the charactersInteract and grow.
B00FOILOSU,Ronda Pennycuff,5,I chose this rating because this is one of my favorite shows. I am a huge fan of Grimm. I like the stories and cast. I have been a fan of Grimm since Season one. I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of fairy tale type shows. The creators of the series has done a great job blending the fairy tales into each episode. I look forward to the rest of Grimm Season three.
B00FOILOSU,Ruben,5,Excellent!!!
B00FOILOSU,SARA,5,Hey!  What gives?...New episode is not available....Same issue with &#34;Dracula&#34;..Will someone please fix this issue?..This kind of lapse sucks when u look forward to each week...
B00FOILOSU,Scott Combs,4,We enjoy this series very much with its light comedy/horror mix.  artfully done with characters that are sensitive and yet light.  An interesting twist on life feom a monster's point of view and those tasked with getting rid of the &#34;Boogy Man.&#34;.RSC
B00FOILOSU,Stinky Greg,5,Great show with outstanding acting and story lines. Something that we will watch more than once. Better than the first two seasons if that's possible.
B00FOILOSU,Ted,5,I enjoy the long term story intertwined with the current surprise plots.The cast is very good in keeping the tempo into the third season.
B00FOILOSU,The repair guy,5,This is a fun show there is something new all the time and a great story that follows every week. Refreshing to know that new is still achievable in TV.
B00FOILOSU,Tony AbernathySr,4,The ultimate super villain program. Grimm is grim in all the right places! Lets the monsters loose! And who could have known the underbelly of evil was contained in a fairy tale book!
B00FOILOSU,victoria,5,This will throw you for a loop. See a reformed werewolf become a vegetarian. lol. all the characters are so cool and very funny. some a little scary. This is so entertaining we were so disappointed when we finished it. we wanted more. you will like this one.
B00FOILOSU,WildflowerLady,5,Plenty of action similar to other seasons but it seems like there is more of a story line for Monroe and Rosalee.  As I have mentioned in a prior season's review - enough already of introducing new wesen: explore the ones already presented!
B00FOILOSU,WirebitersDotCom,5,This is my favorite TV show. My wife also feels the same. It's a modern twist on fantasy creatures with enough side plots to keep a continuous story going.
B00FOILOSU,woody,5,the video is great and the story is great the actors fit their roll very well and not a lot of cussing
B00FOIM524,Amazon Customer,4,I like the family's story. They work and live together and help out their neighbors. This is how it is in Alaska.
B00FOIM524,ancient grandmother,5,I signed up for this series because it is one of the few tv programs (other than sports) that my husband really enjoys.  Now I can have it on hand and stream it to the tv any time he complains about 'nothing decent on tv tonight'.  This makes us both happy.
B00FOIM524,Kelly,5,My favorite episodes. This show is great. I can't wait to go to Alaska some day and go on one of the tours atz has.
B00FOIM524,Preacher Morris,5,I enjoy this show because I love watching the Kiltchers work out various problems. They love life and they love Alaska.
B00FOIM524,Richee,5,Love any show about Alaska. It's pretty cool to see how a family can live off the land. Waiting for season 4.
B00FPH4YRS,SomeoneWife,1,I could not finish watching this movie. It started out good but lost its focus. All I can say is never trust anything that claim it will grant you 3 wishes. Not my kind of movie.
B00FS6COPU,Amy English,3,I was really hoping this would be more similar to the original &#34;Once Upon a Time.&#34; I've not been impressed with the storylines or characters. Kind of a disappointment. :(
B00FS6COPU,Gwen M McDole,2,I tried to love this show but it is really awful. The acting is OK but the story line is terrible.
B00FS6COPU,Heather Scott,5,This tv show definitely reels you into the story Line does a wonderful job of portraying a mixed reality between fairy tale characters and the real world
B00FS6COPU,Lynne A. James "Lynne",4,I don't watch television as a rule. Instead I review a few episodes of something I might like and then buy the season if it is something I am sure I will like. I really enjoyed the first 2 episodes of this series and have not been disappointed. This is an interesting story with believable character development and excellent cinematics.
B00FS6COPU,miss tinkerbell,5,this series ended wayyyyyy before its time the relationship between Alice and Cyrus and friendship between her and the Knave and Rabbit were so heartwarming the Red Queen (Not to be confused with the Queen of Hearts totally different) seeing the red queen and the knave together was great to there were some twists I didn't see coming but that I loved my only complaint was that the series ended in the first place
B00FS6COPU,Nancy Mayton,4,This season started out good and then it to me just kinda got boring. Not sure what happen there. ?
B00FVS3NFA,JD GAYMAN,5,love this season as Parker looks like he is going to get more gold than Todd. The jungle is taking them to the cleaners
B00FVS3NFA,Jeffrey Ehlenfeld "Jeff",3,The best part of Season 4 is in Alaska.It seems the crew we first followed in Season 1 hasn't learned much about planning because they constantly seem to be ill-prepared and make the same mistakes time and time again.If there is a season 5 it will only be because of the interest people have in what the guys are doing in Alaska.
B00FVS3NFA,Rextafier,5,Gold rush shows people the American dream is still alive. Todd has a mind of dreaming that more people should have.
B00FVS3NFA,susan,4,he must like it cause he buys the episodes all the time i my self have not watched it but its a family fav
B00FVS3NFA,Texman,4,Good quality sound and video and always a few surprises as the quest for gold continues. Well edited and produced.
B00FVS3NFA,Vicki Butcher,5,We have watched since season 1. We will continue to watch as the seasons come out.we love the grandpa!
B00FVS44GC,Amazon Customer,5,Great series! It was suggested to me and turned out to be completely fabulous.  Jonathan rhys Meyer is excellent as dracula
B00FVS44GC,Bookworm936,2,I tried to like Dracula.  I wanted to like Dracula.  But I was unable to enjoy it.  Mr. Grayson who is suppose to be Dracula is played by Jonathan Rhys Myers seems to have to concentrate on speaking his lines.  I don't know if it is because he is having issues with the accent or if he lost interest in his role but watching him speak is rather painful.  I know they are trying to revamp and give Dracula a new image but it seems odd to have him talking about Edison and having interest in a light bulb.  Maybe I am just stuck with liking the old mass murder Dracula but he only really drank from one victim aside from licking his female friend and pleasing her at the opera.  The ending rooftop battle was cheesey and I could have done without the Matrix/Crouching Tiger/Max Payne style of fighting.  The style of fighting didn't seem to go with the rest of the movie so it felt disconnected.
B00FVS44GC,briana tarango "Briana Tarango",5,I like Jonathan Rhys Myers as Alexander Grayson I think he does a good job as Count Dracula. I think he is so cute.
B00FVS44GC,Dennis Maloney,4,I've enjoyed the show quite a lot since it started even if it is a bit slow at times.  I like the new take on the character-he poses as a rich American businessman living in London as a cover for his war against the group that cursed him and made him a vampire. I hope the show will be picked up for a second season.
B00FVS44GC,Dina Blythe,4,This version of Dracula can boast fine acting and wonderful atmosphere. A bit too violent for my tastes but I cannot seem to give it up because of the suspenseful storylines.
B00FVS44GC,E. Best,5,I can only say that I would watch anything with Jonathan Rhys Meyers in it!  This actor brought new life to a character that's been over-done so many times.  You'll love it.  Don't start watching if you can't follow thru to the end!
B00FVS44GC,E. Magno,3,This show has a very unique take on the Dracula story. I liked Jonathan Rhys Myers as Henry the VII and so I took a chance on this show. So far it has my interest I'm not sure it can hold it.
B00FVS44GC,EVE  ADAMS,5,Love it. Love  it.  Love it . Just love everything  about  this  show  and  epically  Jonathan  he is one of my favorite  actors.
B00FVS44GC,icewoman63,5,Yes yes yes most awsome wish hed bite me brahm stoker did it best but OMG this will work yes yes yes at least this vampires gorgeous
B00FVS44GC,J. B. Miller,2,The writing was bad. The acting was bad. How can you ruin a bloodsucker show ? Watch it if you like but I would save my money if I where you.
B00FVS44GC,KBZ "writeon",3,Slow pace. Not a very interesting story line. Dark and hard to see. I don't think that it's something that I will go back to or recommend.Plus I think it's a little late to the &#34;Vampire&#34; party. Feels like a dance that's dying out.
B00FVS44GC,M. Hays,5,Maybe I'm just a vampire junkie or a Jonathan Rhys-Myers junkie or both but I really enjoyed this series.  I hope it comes back for another season.  It was an exciting drama and I loved the tension and build of the romance with Mina.  They couldn't have cast a better vampire than JRM.  I loved the Tudors and now this is wonderful.  So yummy!
B00FVS44GC,Michael "KarateMike",5,GREAT SHOW I LOVE THE INTRIGUE AND SMOLDRING SEXY CHARACTERS THAT SEEM TO BE JUST WHAT THE VAMPIRE ORDERED I LOVE IT
B00FVS44GC,michele symonette,1,was not impressed by the pilot and will not be ordering any more episodes.  no new twists very ho hum.
B00FVS44GC,naeler,5,another Dracula video.  And this one is much better than most.Somewhat curious story line.  Great period reenactment.  Great scenery and props.  Great costumes.  Great cast.  Very dark and very Beautiful.
B00FVS44GC,RML,4,I hope this series is continued.  I love Jonathan Rhys Meyers and he certainly brings his intensity to the role of Dracula!
B00FVS44GC,Robert J. Quigley "specs",1,It was alright.  I was not crazy about it when I saw the pilot and never keep up with it.
B00FVS44GC,STONE A JUDLIN "cajun 2 step cut short?",5,Smart / High Production Values / Great off-take on original / Wonderful mixture of time-period & modern.Not convinced about Jonathan Rhys Myers.
B00FVS44GC,S. Warren,3,I just watch a preview of the series so its ok.  not sure even why a preview needs a review.  It seem ok.  Haven't seen the series
B00FVS44GC,Vickie Staton "Quickvick",5,Really a great show to watch...the special effects are great!  Love the story line and love how it's about an all consuming love.
B00FWPDIKW,G. Higley,5,A very fun romp with an excellent cast.  It's nearly impossible for anything with Christopher Guest at the helm to go astray.  Highly recommended.
B00FWPDIKW,LimeyLe,5,Found this show due to an amazon recommendation since I like moon boy. This show is very silly and odd but something about it works. Not sure if it got renewed but I do think it can pull off another season or two based on the plot. The talking monkey was out of left field yet somehow meshed well.
B00FWPDIKW,Matthew Anderson "Robbin505",4,I think Chris O'Dowd its one of the best comedic actors around and Christopher Guest is an amazing writer so this show has lots of apparent talent that makes it one of my favorites.
B00FWPDIKW,M. McCarty "hippy chick",3,If you like Christopher Guest and friends you'll like this one.  He guest starts along with Lenny from Laverne & Shirley..
B00FWPDIKW,ryan halbrook,5,I love love love everything Christopher Guest does. This show was funny and heartfelt. This show also made me seek out the documentary that Nina Conti did.  She is a wonderful ventriloquist.
B00FWPDIKW,Vic Graninger,5,Great British &#34;dry&#34; humor Mr. Dowd is as funny or maybe funnier than he was in &#34;The IT Crowd&#34; (another great British comedy)
B00FY2VS0A,C. conway,5,Most documentaries either talk one subject most if the time luckely there's a 3 part doc mini series from PBS that goes over the time lines of MARVEL AND DC together . This is a very interesting mini series and if you enjoy both universes then you need to see this .ENJOY
B00FY2VS0A,Jennifer D. Williams,5,This is a great informative show about the history of comic book cartoons.  It was a true eye-opener and great history lesson! It's a must-see.
B00FY2VS0A,Robert Becker,3,Wasn't that bad.  The show really explains how superheros and comic books were invented throughout their history.  Was very informative.
B00FZJY336,amrbilly,5,it never get bored and it getting better better...everyone on the show are great and i cant not miss any more show hope it will be renew!
B00FZJY336,Charles Van Cleef,3,My wife liked it for a few episodes.  That's about all I can say about it.  The theory of the show grows old after a very short time.
B00FZJY336,Cynthia,4,We continue to enjoy White Collar. The writing and character development continue to be intriguing and worthwhile viewing. We especially like Elizabeth.
B00FZJY336,Donkey,4,This was a pretty good show even though I have not been following the show. I just wanted to see if it was like Covert Affairs and it is so it would be a good series to watch.
B00FZJY336,EGOlsen,5,The characters continue to develop with more authentic and entertaining personalities.  Some of the &#34;underlying&#34; storey lines are a bit weak but the main plot is still exciting.
B00FZJY336,Eileen J. Troemel "Dragonlady",3,I've been disappointed with this season.  It seems like the writers are tired and lacking ideas.  Previous seasons I was excited for each new episode but this season the episodes just pile up and there is usually something better to watch.
B00FZJY336,Epiphany,5,Love this show because I truly appreciate the character development and depth of the relationships between them as they progress. There's a history and multidimensional aspect to everyone that makes you care about what happens in each episode.
B00FZJY336,finley,5,This show has it all. It has drama and action. The chemistry of the cast is one I have not seen in a while. The ongoing story with the main character has twists and turns that always make you go wow!
B00FZJY336,Harry,4,It's still a very good series. It may be losing a bit of the greatness that it had when it first started. But that's sometimes hard to hold onto when a series has been going this long. You start to look to a conclusion.
B00FZJY336,I. T. L. Hall,4,Couldn't wait for this show to come back on and now the wait between episodes seems painfully long.  I love everything about the show.
B00FZJY336,johnstars,4,Love this show . lots of clever stuff with not so many guns!.Mozi is the best love Rebecca So hot!
B00FZJY336,K. Thomas,5,I have to confess I like the other seasons better. I liked it more when Peter and Neal had their banter but had their backs. This new Peter I don't care for too much. I have had to put it down ...I am sure I will come back to it an it might turn around.
B00FZJY336,Lauren,4,Season 5 is not as wonderful as some past seasons but I think that is because we know the show so well.  But that is not to sy it isn't still very compelling and addictive!  I am always excited for the next episode.
B00FZJY336,L. Carson "L Carson",5,One of my favorites!  The complicity of the characters is intriguing to say the least!  Neal's gunna get found out one of these days - soon!
B00FZJY336,md,5,One of the best show that I been watching for almost 5 years. Love white collar and hope to see few more seasons.
B00FZJY336,Nancy Barrett,5,looking forward to the new episodes. hoping that neal and peter regain their friendship. like burn notice I am not ready for it to end
B00FZJY336,Sally Ruse,5,White collar is a great shows it is one of the best shows on TV. I watch white collar and I was hook.
B00FZJY336,Sandy J.,5,Each episode is intriquing and interesting.  I love all the characters and there is just enough action without being too violent.
B00FZJY336,Shannon Castleberry,5,This is a great light feel good series. I love this show. I was looking for something easy to watch and thought I would give it a try. So very happy I did. I love all the actors as they play their parts well and it is absolutely a fun show. Well worth the time and now that I am completely caught up after watching all available episodes I have to wait for current episode to air on regular tv. Well worth the wait though. A great series for drama and comedy combined. I love it.
B00FZJY336,STONE A JUDLIN "cajun 2 step cut short?",3,I don't like the change in dynamics between Peter & Neil.I HATED the introduction of a new handler ... I'm glad they killed him off.I don't like that Neil is having to do so many &#34;underneath&#34; things.This seems to be a setup for some really bad blood between he & Peter.And why did they change Elizabeth's personality.  She's sort of turned mean toward Neil.
B00FZJY336,Theresa Lepiane "Theresa",5,This is a great show.  The acting is fine and the plot line is absolutely great. Well worth the price.
B00G2TAAVM,Andre Villemaire,2,Not a big action movie...kind of a love story with a possible war breaking up...but most scenes are following 2 girls throughsome situations...lots of scenery..  music to put ya to sleep also......and its really not a movie for us guys....as even if you paid me I wouldn't watch it again.
B00G2TAAVM,R. Foss "RF",1,This movie was horrible. It was way better than sharknado but that isn't saying much. This movie was depressing. I like survival type movies but this was not really cool in that way at all. It was very slow and boring. The character development was not good at all. And it bothered me that she started sleeping with her cousin. Creepy. I don't really like seeing young kids get killed for no reason either without an explanation. It was like they were trying to create drama but with bad taste. The story focuses more on the blonde with a bad attitude and her relationship with her cousin. I am sad I wasted my money on this.
B00G32MX9U,Clearlyclaire,5,My 9-year-old son thought Kung Fu Panda was Great! Tiger and Panda have an interesting relationship that sometimes looks more like frienemies than friends- we've enjoyed talking about their differences and what each one does best. Good clean fun for kids.
B00G32MX9U,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",5,Simply great mental relief watching Po being very ordinary and extraordinary.  The subtle comments give a chuckle and always the moral of the skit comes through very well.
B00G32MX9U,K.S. "Sunshine",5,I love that TV show as that makes me relax while I enjoyed watching ... It is very short but I still love it!!
B00G4CIE88,Dan Hawks,3,These documentaries are of past crimes back in the 50' and even older. Good mysteries.
B00G5R9DZA,S. mcpherson "McSarah",5,Love this show! Milano does a darn good job filling those designer hosting shoes! All our favorite designers are back and raring to go!
B00G5R9DZA,Wes B.,3,This All Stars was the weakest season to me as it seems like they were rushed to film the season.  I love the cast and it is still Project Runway so worth the time to watch.
B00G7Z0T8K,Shelley Danica Black "Race it & take it!!!",5,This show is totally one of my favorite shows because Steve brings the investigative side & Amy brings the witchy~poo side to it. They are both incredibly accurate which at first was alarming but now it just rocks! &#128526;
B00GAGJXJW,Lawrence,1,Do not waste your money on this one! Not worth it for $8 rent! Better wait for it on Netflix.
B00GAGJXJW,Nicole Smith,2,weird...
B00GAMC90G,Dennis Maloney,5,Really enjoyable and much more believeable than some other monster hunting shows. I really hope that one day they will find something that convinces Ranae that Sasquatch does exist.
B00GAMC90G,william barnes,1,Don't waste your time or money watching this show. 3 red-necks and a woman running around in the woods looking for big-foot banging on  trees and yelling to get a response. either way its not as good as I thought it would be. The people make the show and these 4 don't make it happen. It must appeal to some because it has returned for its 5th season. and don't get me  wrong nothing wrong with red-necks. yee haw  :)
B00GBUQXSG,Dennis "barbarosa",3,More than I expected but still not much to this movie. Nothing new with about everything having been borrowed from earlier movies. I do like Liev Schrieber but his talen was wasted in this movie
B00GBUQXSG,Jacqueline Garrett "jackie g",1,I love Schrieber but I hated this movie it was long it was the worst alien ripoff I've ever seen and I couldn't wait for to be over if I hadn't purchased it I would've given up
B00GBUQXSG,Michael P. Mcintire,1,Another zombie movie. Poor lighting. Poor sound. In the dark half the time. This has food actors who are stuck with a lousy script.
B00GBUQXSG,thecoolcard,3,don't have much to say because it was just ok.  ok to watch one time if you like syfy/horror.don't send a lot to see it because you could spent the money on a much better movie but if you can get it cheepgive it a go
B00GBUQXSG,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",5,The Last Days on Mars was interesting and exciting. It had me rooting for a couple of the main characters hoping that they get away alive.
B00GCET720,Charlene Perdue,5,This has been a great season but I think Candi needs to put her mother Joyce in her place or she will never get the happiness she deserves.  Joyce and her senior citizen posse thinking they are bad lol.  I thought Ne Ne thinks she is better than the other girls and she is to arrogant this season and maybe she has just outgrown the show.  Porsche needs to go.  You have all of these intelligent women and the you have Porsche.
B00GCET720,driftwood,5,Love this show. Not surprised that this is the most watched housewives. Always many great moments. Love it. Keep throwing that shade and pouring the thick T.
B00GCET720,Fannie Tillman,5,These women are hilarious and dramatic at the same time... Is a great man show that takes your mind off of real life because it's so ridiculous...
B00GCET720,FLOWERPOWERMD,4,DONT LIKE WHEN THEY GET VIOLENT IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR GODS SAKE THEY ARE RICHAND HAVE MANY PRIVILEDGES. WHO CARES IF SOMEONES MAKES A COMMENT ON YOUR WIG OR SUCH
B00GCET720,mistic,5,porsha porsha porsha!  lmfaoooooooooooooooooooo rofl. yaaaaaasssssssssss! hahahahaha. Good season cant wait til season 7 lets goooooooo! I am ready darling .
B00GCEVU3E,Another opinion,3,Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining. The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass. Season 4 was my least favorite of all.  There was too much bitterness.
B00GCEVU3E,Cami=) "Cami=)",3,The new season is weird....its like they ran out of fairly interesting stuff so they are just inventing it now....beat that dead horse like the oc housewives.....create drama poorly.  Cant even pretend its semi real now...
B00GCEVU3E,Charlene Perdue,4,I have followed this and other seasons all the way through but Im very disappointed with the selection of new cast you have chosen this season.  Joyce is beautiful and she fits in well with the other ladies but if Carlton returns for the next season I will no longer be a viewer.
B00GCEVU3E,cherylannemarie,5,I find this show entertaining...and love to see how the rich people live.  It's just for fun--money does not buy happiness....
B00GCEVU3E,C. Hill,3,I am starting to find these type reality shows a little depressing.  A person grows up being indoctrinated on the &#34;American Dream&#34; only to see these people who have supposedly achieved it settling for the worst examples of success and what it is to have &#34;friends&#34; that I have ever witnessed.  If this is what one can expect friends who needs any?  Genre is becoming depressing.
B00GCEVU3E,Jdances "bdancer",4,These ladies are fun to watch.  Sometimes I think the fighting is fueled by alcohol.  One one note it's sad because some of these ladies are &#34;not&#34; actually friends but put together for the show.  Hopefully everyone involved will get their fame moments.  My faves: Yolanda~Carlton~Brandi~Lisa
B00GCEVU3E,R. Foss "RF",1,I have to agree with the rest of the reviews. They need to drop the SuR drama employees. Their annoying anyway. I absolutely love Lisa but her employees are making her look bad.Those waitresses are way fake wannabes.  People like that will lie and use people to get somewhere. Their dorks. I don't want to pay to watch a bunch of dorks when I can just go down to Hollywood and find them on the street there. I want to see a 100% full hour of BHHW drama. Not 80% Real Housewives and 20% dorks. It's fine if you want to do a show with just dorks but I don't want to be forced to watch dorkism.
B00GCEVU3E,Vyctorya,4,I think the show is entertaining.  Sometimes it makes me laugh.  I think it is worth the cost.  See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com.
B00GCG92J6,Carla tamari,5,This is a really great series it seems these people are as real as one can get for a reality show.  I know some situations are &#34;placed&#34; but. I want to see more and know more about them. They are interesting and show their hearts and flaws. These would be people you would want on your side.  It is the only reality series where I don't want to smack anyone there are no nasties; maybe just major misbehaving.  PS Mike is stellar handsome and his fianc&eacute; should kiss his feet.  Love it.
B00GCG92J6,Jdances "bdancer",5,Hope I spelled that correctly.  Love love love this series!!! Asa OMG you are wonderful and creative and really kind. They seem to have big Persian Fun.  OMG the food alone is fun.  Really enjoyed the trip to Turkey made me cry.  Blessed Be y'all!
B00GGC4PCA,Anne Lee,4,Mike and Molly meet an OA meeting and hit off right away. The two have to navigate misunderstandings that are the result of insecurities and being hurt in past relationships but there is a lot of fun along the way.
B00GGC4PCA,Barbara A. Kephart,5,This couple and their family members are hilarious! The season has just ended but I am already impatient for the next to start.
B00GGC4PCA,LLB52,5,We missed this episode due to a problem with our DVR.  It's such a funny show that we didn't want to miss an episode.
B00GGC4PCA,suzatm,3,I'm still going to watch the show but this season is not as good as the previous ones.  I think some of the episodes have been just so- so with very few laugh out loud moments.  If I want a laugh I am finding that I replay the episodes from previous seasons over this season.
B00GJVBRGU,Melanie,1,Zzzzzzzzzzz!
B00GJVBRGU,Taheen Lopez,3,This award-winning festival hit stars Emile Hirsch (&#34;Into the Wild&#34;) and Stephen Dorff (&#34;Somewhere&#34;) as two brothers who are forced to flee Reno after being involved in a hit-and-run accident. Based on the novel by Willy Vlautin.
B00GK51FO4,Big A "Wesley",5,Such an interesting documentary. I loved seeing the voices and skills it takes to make some of my favorite characters come to life. It is a must see for any cartoon lover or person that loves the entertainment industry.
B00GK51FO4,Ryan Pritchard "thor_oakenfelder",5,John Dimaggio put together an amazing collection of voice talent to talk about the career of voice acting. The people involved are alternately funny and informative. I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the people behind the voices of some of their favorite animated characters.
B00GK51FO4,TL in SB,4,This is a really good documentary.  See also &#34;That Guy in That Thing&#34; which is even better.
B00GK5WGBU,Cyn,4,Rob lowe has his moments of capturing Jfk but it is not consistent.  Jackie was a joke as they totally missed the mark in not only casting but simple items like her habit of nail biting. I have seen a better portrayal in previous movies.
B00GLYM3QS,Barbara Hartwell "Tiarasncrwns",2,I watched this movie waiting for the suspense and instead I got bored. The ending was expected and a let down. Gld that this was just a rental
B00GLYM3QS,Debrina Maria "Debrina",4,This movie had some turns and some surprising parts to it. At the end everything came together. Hope this never happens in real life without enough meds/cure to go around and hope everyone has their own stash.
B00GLYM3QS,Dstress,3,An interesting take on the &#34;Z&#34; genre we've been getting a lot of lately. A nice sense of confusion is established at the beginning and as the story unfolds we find people are not what they seem at all. Good acting overall and Sharlto Copley continues to create interesting characters in the few films I've seen him in so far
B00GLYM3QS,jks1980,5,Very cool movie definitely worth watching full of suspense and definitely creepy. Well acted and written Im definitely surprised it didn't get more publicity!
B00GLYM3QS,Mike suell,3,Good
B00GLYM3QS,Route66Review,2,It was not half as good as some here are rating it.  Must be family members of the cast and or crew.  It was also very boring and lacked any real gore other than a constant pit of dead corpses that look really good considering how long they've been rotting.  I also noticed there were no maggots on the corpses.  HMMMM  My final thought  - Lame-O-Rama.
B00GLYM3QS,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",4,Spooky spooky with an added weird twist at the end.  Definitely something different for thriller fans and I enjoyed it.
B00GMA9SKK,Day Fan,4,This movie was a little different than expected.  You may get just a little mad because of how things work out.  I do recommend it for this.
B00GMA9SKK,jjceo,3,A successful prosecuting attorney goes out with his friends and they get him drunk. Stupidly he drives home and has an accident. Rather than stay and wait for the police or an ambulance he does a hit and run and now he must face the consequences of his actions.  He helps to free a man falsely accused of the hit and run only to find out the true story about the man he helped free.This film had potential but it just moves to slowly at times. I won't go into any spoilers but I just wish the director has made the film more interesting.  The movie is only 91 minutes long and that counts 10 minutes of credits. The plot has several twists and turns in it that would make it interesting but the acting just drags the movie down.In addition it is not believable as the ending is just silly.  A lawyer that commits at least 10 major felonies is happily at home with his family?  For me this is a 2 to 3 star movie but my wife liked it more than me and I'll make it a 3 star.
B00GMA9SKK,Michelle,4,I enjoyed this movie. Samuel Jackson was great! If you are looking for a thrill this movie is it. :)
B00GMA9SKK,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,How can you lose with these two?  It was a movie jam packed with action and it kept me glued to my seat.
B00GMTLB5G,Mujnmom,5,My son loves this show and it is very funny.  The penguins are great / just enough action to keep my 8 year old interested and still wonderfully cute and funny.
B00GNEXHXY,Amazon Customer,5,I love Curious George and so does my kiddo. I was so pleased to see that Amazon added the seventh season to the Prime list! Access to these shows for our toddler is one of the main reasons we have Prime. Good work Amazon!
B00GNEXHXY,D. M. Garland,5,My two year old great grandson loves watching the show and I can last through several episodes without going bananas myself.
B00GNEXHXY,N. R. "Handy Mandy",5,Funny as always and informative. Good for kids to think in different ideas as George illustrate his struggle how to accomplish his way through his new life with the Yellow man. Always good for kids!
B00GNEXHXY,razrbax5280,5,My kids love Curious George and it's easy watching on Prime.  Couldn't ask for better.  The best is no commercials!
B00GNL4IY4,B. Hamlin,4,It was nice that Paul Walker was in every scene. It was a little bit like that Tom Hanks movie where he's in every scene and talking to a volleyball or basketball. Paul Walker is either talking to his daughter in the little ventilator machine or he's talking to himself about what to do net. IMA Paul Walker fan and so I wanted to see the movie because of him. I also wanted to see the movie because I had a friend from New Orleans visiting me when Hurricane Katrina hit. We were on Google Earth trying to figure out where her house was and if you don't have your house number painted on the roof everything looks alike. I thought it was a good movie and worth renting. The awful stuff Paul Walker's character ran into in the hospital with thieves shooting whomever they came in contact with was a reality in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The movie was historically accurate.
B00GNL4IY4,M. HARRIS "MAVDRAC",3,I though it was well done. it was sad to see Paul Walker in one of his last movies to be made.
B00GO8KFJS,J. Gwin "Jules",5,I LOVED THE FIRST EPISODE OF SEASON 1 SO FAR. AND I DO BELIEVE THE REST WILL EVEN GET BETTER!!!
B00GP6YH8O,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,funniest show ever...I am so glad it is back for a full season!!!! I hope It never goes way ever
B00GP6YH8O,Dan Hertel,5,great story line the kid who is raised by teen parents and has a kid with a serial killer and the grandmother who is only all there part of the time just funny stuff keep this show on thank you.
B00GP6YH8O,Penny Tunnell,5,I loved this series and am sad to see it end. This season wasn't as top notch as past seasons but still highly enjoyable! If you are a fan you definitely should follow it to the end and then sadly say goodbye:(.
B00GP74EX6,Carol J. Rader "crdvm",5,The Seasons are extremely short at 4 episodes. The stories were masterfully complex must came around at the end with attention to the little details.
B00GP74EX6,catthief,5,I love the older and tired Foyle.  I am older and tired and still hanging in there.  Foyle is smart and it is such an excellent show.  Please keep making Foyles War.
B00GP74EX6,joy,5,Foyle doesn't get old.  We liked the earlier seasons more but appreciated his obvious disgust with the spooks.  We certainly did not regret watching season 8 and would keep on watching.  Michael Kitchen is great.
B00GP74EX6,Marie Silverman "nysefox",5,Is the new series 8 worth the price of $7.99 per episode (gulp!). Yep! I'm hoping we see a series 9 in the not to distant future. Highly recommend!
B00GP74EX6,mary ruth,5,Marvelous acting and just so much to learn as this goes through the years. WWII in England was something that I had not been familiar with and I enjoyed learning all about it and the many challenges  they had to endure.
B00GP74EX6,Nancy Gambrell,5,I just love Foyles War and I can't wait until 2015 for the 9th seaon
B00GUPFO5U,Charles Van Cleef,4,I really did not want to like this series or this season because I am so incredulous at the skinny Asian woman kicks huge man's butt every time theme and the multiple love interests that I am not always in the moment while watching the show. My wife picked this series. But while I have my nuts to pick I watched every episode with her and this season was no exception.
B00GUPFO5U,dr_j,5,I have enjoyed Nikita. At times it was almost too angst-filled.They ended the series well. I will miss the characters.I look forward to re-visiting and binge watching it for years to come.
B00GUPFO5U,edna de medeiros,3,The madness never goes to the end. To much blood; the bad people always win. All the episodes always are the same stories:revenge.You feel like the happiness won't happen.
B00GUPFO5U,Popular1,5,I only allowed myself to watch this and The GOOd Wife. So sorry to see such an inspirational character go. I cant even watch until the final season is complete-i feel like I need to savor the episodes! LOL Crazy huh!
B00H294Z2Q,John E. Scott,5,I find this series both informative and controversial.  Its very interesting to learn about our ancient past and be presented withtheories about extraordinary happenings of the time. I have certainly open my mind to these theories and even if you don't care about the ancient alien aspect of the series. Its still has a lot of good information about civilizations from thousands of years ago.
B00H294Z2Q,Paul Aguirre,5,Good episodes I love this show A lot of what they talk about makes sense if you really think about I would recommend everyone watch this
B00H294Z2Q,Teresa Pietersen,5,Even if you agree or not with the Ancient Aliens Theory this series certainly opens up all sorts of questions and takes you to some of the most spectacular sites on earth. The series does become addictive for those of us with the ability to think outside the box and who are willing to just ask &#34;what if&#34; type questions. If you've been following the program from season one you'll enjoy the latest episodes.
B00H294Z2Q,THE GHOSTSTAR     ORIGINAL,5,***I LOVE THIS SERIES...THE PRODUCTION QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING ...THEIR PROOF IS SUBSTANTIAL AND CLEARLY EXPLAINED AND YEAR AFTER YEAR IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE LIKELY SOME OF US ARE FROM THE STARS...I KNOW I AM...IM THE GHOSTSTAR ORIGINAL !!!*** THEESE STUDIES OF THE ANCIENT ALIEN THERORY ARE MY RELEGION...SOME ONE SHULD START A CHURCH SO WE CAN HAVE IT FUNDED AND RUN TAX FREE !
B00H294Z2Q,The repair guy,5,The evidence is clear we are not alone and have possibly never been must see I have the entire series and it is a good one. Worth the money and the time as the exploration of space may begin and end at home on earth not in the stars.
B00H2E66H8,DoctorBob,4,It reminds me of a Bob Newhart type of show. There is one character that knows what is going on and he's surrounded by people who don't. Some interesting episodes that mix drama a d comedy.
B00H4UG71A,Charlene Perdue,5,This season was great.  Renee needs some professional help.  Alesha and Natalie brought a little something new to the table but Big Ang and Darita are the bombs and they make the show worth watching.
B00H4UG71A,Jdances "bdancer",5,They really give you the bang for you buck!  What is not to like about Italians anyway! Good food; good friends; and always a good time. RockOn wives!
B00H4UG71A,kelly,5,I have fallowed the show sense season 1 . I love the show and will continue to watch for as long as it's on
B00H4UGQZC,Amanda,5,I love all seasons of this show - highly recommend!  It's funny and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know who will get matched up with who.
B00H4UGQZC,Lynn,5,It is an entertaining show to watch and see couples interaction. Some people on the show should never marry but it is fun to see
B00H55JEHI,Dave G. Wynne "triguy50",5,The acting was great.  I like that it dealt with so many issues that we face today.  How does a family deal with a parent who is dying.
B00H7NDSPC,Amazon Customer,5,The acting is so real I'm almost convinced that all these characters all really do love and fight in this setting.  Bowd is my favorite. Enemy
B00H7NDSPC,Amazon Customer,5,After five season this show still rocks. This show has a great cast of characters. I would call this show a comedy/drama.  I love the Crow family. Season after season they always come up with a great cast of bad guys. I still love this show.
B00H7NDSPC,Amazon Customer,5,We love this series and to be able to watch it without commercials is worth every penny!  If you have never watched Justified - then go back and start from the beginning - it's hard to believe - but it gets better every year!
B00H7NDSPC,Andrew Baker,5,Justified Rocks! One of the best series ever! We love this program! 9 out of 10 stars! Yay! Yay! Yay!
B00H7NDSPC,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",4,As the season progresses the Crowder family begins to fall apart as more and more of the family fall into violent situations leaving some very wounded emotionally and physically. Fortunes are lost in the new drug trade and it looks like Raylin's boss might fall victim to a violent interchange with Crowder family members. We have yet to find out how all this may come to an end while Raylin guards the Chief right next  to his hospital bed where he lies unconscious after having been shot by a Crowder.  The suspense grows as Boyd Crowder tries to rescue the love of his life who has been unjustly treated while she is in prison.  Sparks continue to fly in this suspenseful drama set in Tennessee.
B00H7NDSPC,aztnge,5,shows on tv/cable ~ really enjoy the actors & the plot line ~ I will really miss it after next season
B00H7NDSPC,babs,5,The episodes that I have seen thus far are great.  The show has a humorous side in spite of the fact that there is quite a lot of violence.  You find yourself very involved with what is going to happen to the characters you like.  Always looking forward to the next episode.  Very entertaining!
B00H7NDSPC,Bacon,5,Justified is one my all time favorite shows. I had no idea it existed until I got Amazon prime. Awesome show.
B00H7NDSPC,B. Merrill,5,I love the ongoing relations with Raylan and the people from his old home town. Its fun to watch the interactions of them all. I do think moving the show to fl will be a good change. The Kentucky setting is getting old but the show is great. Love to see it relocate. They have hinted towards Raylan getting transferred back to fl. Love to see a more Burn Notice type of scenery. Season five was very entertaining and well worth watching.
B00H7NDSPC,C. A. Neal,4,This season was good but not as well written as previous seasons. I didn't not like the Crow family storyline. I would still recommend watching it because it will follow along into the next season. The main characters keep getting better. I would like to see Raylan Givens with his wife and daughter. They are good for each other.
B00H7NDSPC,Carol K. Simpson "Carol",5,We love Justified.  Enough said.
B00H7NDSPC,Chris St Pierre,5,Each season brings new adventures and mayhem to Harlan County. You begin to really feel at home and want to visit. :)
B00H7NDSPC,Chuck St. Louis "The Saint",5,The first 4 seasons were great. I binged watched them. As in one episode after another. There are four characters that could be a lead in any show. I don't know who cast this show but the women are the finest of the fine. Eva is just incredible. Her range of emotions is incredible. For most everyone I would suggest giving this series a try.Chuck
B00H7NDSPC,CMZ Art,5,Easy way to enjoy this show without having cable..it is one of the few shows I pay to watch and no regrets.
B00H7NDSPC,Danny L. Abernathy,5,next to the last season and no end in sight.boyd is boyd and raylan is same.art the only sane one is almost insane.maybe theo will blow them all up and asit seems to be going . ??
B00H7NDSPC,Dave W,5,Just heard that next year will be the last....I'll enjoy this season and next and mourn the end of another great FX series.
B00H7NDSPC,Debbie Dillon,5,So far Season 5 is as good as the last 4. This is one of my favorite shows. Such good actors!.
B00H7NDSPC,Deborah Martin,5,Plot lines are engaging. Characters interesting. Always sorry when the show is over each episode because we want to know what happens next.
B00H7NDSPC,Dennis "barbarosa",5,I am &#34;di-voing&#34; the rest of the season but missed the first show of the season so I paid for this first episode. Great show still and the series isnt showing that it is slowly dying yet as some shows do after season 2 or 3. Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite actors and I consider &#34;Crazies&#34; to be one of the best movies made over the past several years. Great actor that now gets to make that BIG television money!!
B00H7NDSPC,Dona L. Sears "searsgig",5,OOOOO Timothy Oliphant....what's not to like?
B00H7NDSPC,donna l. krause,5,The characters on justified are so well acted and scripted. It's almost impossible to express how excellent this show is. Very witty dialog.
B00H7NDSPC,Douglas Tyler,5,Love the screen weighting and acting.  Love the actors and the script.  Looking forward to the next series.  Doug Tyler
B00H7NDSPC,D. Robertson,5,I have watched every episode of Justified and it is consistently great and every season seems to be better than the last.  I especially like the mix of laughs and action.  It is must see TV
B00H7NDSPC,Elaine Woodford,5,Stll a great show.  I tell all my friends about it. Would like to see Raylan get together with Winona permanently ....or someone else.  There is such kindness in him and vulnerability because of his childhood with an abusive father who never showed him love plus he lost his mother who loved him.  Thank God for the love of his aunt.  If not for her he'd either be dead or in prison.  He tries so hard to clean up the crime in his area of Kentucky.  Would love to see him be a real dad to his baby. And would like to see Boyd and his beautiful woman stop all of their crime and find happiness before something terrible happens to one of them. They are such likable people.  Boyd definitely grows on you!!
B00H7NDSPC,Eleanor Weber,5,Probably my favorite show. I love it. I look forward to it every season. Timothy Oliphant is the best. Great.
B00H7NDSPC,Geoff Masci,5,As usual-Just a good solid show. Needs more Boyd. Less Ava and Crowes. I realize this is the last season but...
B00H7NDSPC,Gerrob,5,I think this show is great but wonder at times what the rest of the world thinks of Americans they watch it. Does Putin watch this show? Is that why he keeps testing us?
B00H7NDSPC,Haven Healer,5,This is a really good series.  Interesting plot twists.  Really look forward to each new episode.  One of those rare series in which I like the #1 bad guy as much as the #1 good guy.
B00H7NDSPC,helena,4,So far it is ok. I was hoping for more of Raylan action. The other seasons seemed better. But it may perk up. I think viewers like to see more of Raylan and his older ways. At least I do.  :o)
B00H7NDSPC,Isaac N Hoagland,5,I've enjoyed every season of Justified.  They wife and I have binged watched watch ever season.  Can hardly wait for season 6.
B00H7NDSPC,Janet C. Walker,4,Only one more season to go with Raylin and his crew going after Boyd.  This has been a great show so far and I expect it will wrap up well.
B00H7NDSPC,Jared,5,If you like crime drama this is for you.  Rayland Gibbons is a Marshall that is above board most of the time but sometimes is not.  If you get a chance to watch from the beginning it all ties together very nicely.  I have started watching season five and this is the best season yet.  It is based in Kentucky.  He was a Marshall in Miami and got kicked back to Kentucky where he grew up and knows everyone.  He shoots from the hip and the crime and drama tie in well.  The bad guys are bad and he is a good guy that gets the job done.  It cool how the Marshals work and investigate different crimes in Harland county.  Most of the actors seem like they fit in in the back &#34;woods&#34;.  I recommend this highly.
B00H7NDSPC,Jeannette L Bertsch,4,I really have enjoyed Justified. I like the fact that everyone has there on piece of the puzzle to make up the full story. I love Marshall Raylan Givens it is like he has time traveled from long ago to the present. I will hate to see this series end. I will definitely buy all seasons for my video library.
B00H7NDSPC,jim jones,5,Couldn't quit watching working on finishing 5 hope you continue on to 6 once you get started its draws you in
B00H7NDSPC,Juan "Prince Moloch",5,This season is much better then the last two seasons yet the critics have been harsher. I think that with the additions of Witt and Rapaport the show is back on track but sadly it's being canceled after season 7.
B00H7NDSPC,Judy B,5,I accidentally deleted episode 4 Over the Mountain from our DVR before my husband could watch it and had yet to show on demand so I turned to Amazon and saved the day! It was another fun episode except we really like Dewey's character and hate that he is now a murderer!
B00H7NDSPC,Julie Murphy,5,This show just keeps getting better and better every season.  Too bad they will only have one more.
B00H7NDSPC,June,5,I wait impatiently for the new seasons to come. This is one of the best shows I enjoy. The books I read were good & they are using a lot of the story of Raylon Givans.
B00H7NDSPC,JW-169,5,Knew it was going be a good TV Series from the first season. Can't wait to see the rest of season 5 and just waiting to see what happens in season 6. Too bad that cousin Johnny met his fate in the deserts of Mexico I hope that he is just wounded and they assume that he is gone and he that he actually survives...??
B00H7NDSPC,Karen L. Hart "karen l hart",5,This one of my favorite shows.  My dish was covered in ice and was unable to watch this on my TV.  I am so glad that I could go right to Amazon Prime and for a small fee watch my show.
B00H7NDSPC,Kelley Kuhlman "paperglyphs",4,What can you say about Justified? Great characters and plots that keep you wanting more. I do have to say that this pushes my violence -comfort- button often but I do love the characters.
B00H7NDSPC,Kindle Customer,2,Too bloody and cold-hearted for my liking.  This does not give the southern way of live a true rendition.  There is a big difference between &#34;talking about violence&#34; and &#34;actually showing it&#34;.I doubt if I will watch any more episodes of this series.
B00H7NDSPC,K. Thomas,5,LOVE THE SHOW. WOULD RECOMMEND OTHERS TO WATCH IT. DIFFERENT FROM THE PRIOR SEASONS ...JURY STILL OUT AS TO WHETHER BETTER OR NOT :)
B00H7NDSPC,lily,3,I've loved this series but there is there is a turn towards violence over character and plot development that diminishes my interest in this series.
B00H7NDSPC,LOVE ME MY AMAZON,5,IT WAS GREAT BUT SEASON 6 SHOUD BE A HUMM DINGER..  WITH MOST OF THE PLACE CALMNG DOWN WHATS BOYED GOING TO DO ???
B00H7NDSPC,Marie Lynch "artist",5,With Dewy Crow back on the scene and the Florida Crows in the picture we are seeing some of the quirkyest characters in Harlan County to date.  Most creative writing ever.  BRAVO!
B00H7NDSPC,Marika,5,Never thought I'd be so interested in watching a crime story about a bunch of rednecks. The stuff that goes on in Kentucky is similar to what would happen in New York except for the backwoods attire and accents. I find it very entertaining.
B00H7NDSPC,MaryBee,4,What would Raylan do?  Who can't love some of these characters... Boyd and Dewey?  Season 5 was more of the same good TV drama = Good writing and good acting.
B00H7NDSPC,M. Frederiksen "mjf2000",5,This show continues to be one of the best on television. The writing is well above the rest and the cast is nothing less than superior.
B00H7NDSPC,M.L. Lennon,5,Just keeps getting better.  Only one more season left and the gap it will leave will only be filled by watching it all over again...
B00H7NDSPC,MM,5,This has to be one of the best shows on TV.  Can't wait each week to see what is going to happen next. The acting is fantastic.
B00H7NDSPC,MWOO,5,It is hard to believe they can just keep getting better.  All the character actors are perfect.The story keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I can't wait for the sixth season.  Pleasedon't be the last.
B00H7NDSPC,my name is nobody,4,A good opener for season 5. Dewey Crow is back a new Crow cousin is introduced and Boyd is trying to get Ava out of jail while trying to expand his criminal empire.
B00H7NDSPC,ORURO H.S.,4,I LOVE THE ACTING BUT SEASON FIVE IS DRAGGING ALONG. MORE OF THE SAME...ALTHOUGH RAYLAN IS TRUE TO THE ELMORE LEONARD NOVEL.
B00H7NDSPC,Patricia Appelquist,4,tease tease me until you make me think its my fault for this relationship then I remember you are fictional ...oh walter you been naughty
B00H7NDSPC,Paula Jankowski,5,my second favorite showI will watch Timothy Olyphant any time he is on anythingHe is in a class all his own
B00H7NDSPC,Paul Danneman,5,I guess that's the most appealing aspect of this series.All the actors fit perfectly in their roles.Great series.
B00H7NDSPC,Penny Abernathy,5,Timothy Olyphant and the entire supporting cast is superb in this addicting series.  The story is set in Kentucky where the people are interesting and the scenery is beautiful.
B00H7NDSPC,R. A. Macgaren,5,This show is riveting and hold your attention.  There is so much going on and the web keeps getting tangled.  I am sorry next year will be the last season.  I have the entire set and will be watching them over and over.
B00H7NDSPC,Randy Ruhlman,5,Love it!!! Please lets have season 6.Keeps me on the edge of my seat.Can't get enough of it!
B00H7NDSPC,Rebussmile,5,What was already the best show on tv now added Amy Smart and a new crew of bad guys.Buy the season.
B00H7NDSPC,Ruffus McGee,5,This show is so awesome! There is only one more season left. They say that they only had planned 6 seasons from the get go. Sad Face.
B00H7NDSPC,samer kader,4,This season is good like all seasons and it a lot more dynamic with many scenarios than just around the block.
B00H7NDSPC,Sandra L. Cassidy,5,Love this show & was afraid this season would disappoint but it didn't! It was wonderful! Can't wait till the 6th season & very sad it will be the last.
B00H7NDSPC,S. Clark "Friend",5,There is nothing bad or off about Justified. Season 5 is the best so far.  The entire cast rocks it!
B00H7NDSPC,Sproutsmom,5,The casting on this show is unbelievable. The story line is not at all predictable - each episode leaves you wanting more.
B00H7NDSPC,Sr Happy Popi "Mr. Stacy J.",4,We'll see how the story shapes up as the season continues.  The story is a few episodes along and moving kind of slow.  A long Build-Up is OK if there's a good Pay-Off.  The gang's all here. They haven't disappointed so far.
B00H7NDSPC,Stanley Cook,5,This is a really good series.  Good shoot'em up and really looking forward to season 6 and the story continues.
B00H7NDSPC,Subq,5,So many twists and turns to this story. I cant wait to see the ending! Very tastefully done. Good development of characters. We were not sure we would like it. But we do!!!!
B00H7NDSPC,sue m,5,I have enjoyed this since day one.  Everyone would like to have Raylan in there hometown. Every town has a Dewey Crow!
B00H7NDSPC,Terry S Thomas,5,Can you say &#34; I now want to become a US Marshal and move to Kentucky!  Let me just say that each character on this show makes it a phenomenal show. Love love love this show.
B00H7NDSPC,webbsb,5,This season is great!  The only bad thing is having to wait to watch the next episode.  I'm sad to hear that next season will be the last one!
B00H7NDSPC,Whomike "Whomike",5,Greatest US Marshall series I have ever seen! If you like TV that is fairly &#34;edgy&#34;- you will like this series. Especially if you are employed in the criminal justice field.
B00H7NDSPC,Wife Mother Moon Child "&#34;Grandma&#34;",5,I was sorry to see this TV series end because it seemed as if I knew the characters personally and thus wanted to know where else the road of life would lead them.
B00H7VM5UI,Donkey,2,These two dumb girls decide to ride their bikes and come across a water tank. They are drunk and strip to their underwear. It is dark so one jumps in and the other follows without even checking the tank for a way of escape. Well the water is at a low level and they have a hard time getting out.I waited till the end to see if they ever could figure out how to get out and it was quite clever I will admit. But not everything goes right! The ladder was too high so they had to improvise. If I ever got stuck in this situation I will remember this trick but I won't get into this situation!
B00H7VM5UI,Lolo,4,it shows the nature of people and what humans do under stress  where the true character of a person shows.  Also what people do to survive and the decisions they have to make.
B00H7VM5UI,Sasha,4,I can't describe the film without a spoiler. But this is one of the most creative indies I've ever seen. You'll need a moment of silence to soak it in.
B00H8BPJTQ,cozzetta,2,It was alright not horrible.
B00H8BPJTQ,Dstress,3,A weird crazy mix of sex and craziness Oh and the Devil too ! Not really scary but had an interesting vibe throughout.
B00H8C3FTQ,ladererdaysaint "William",5,I enjoyed the video and it sure seems to now lots of news with in the video and is interesting to watch. Lots of good scripture in it. I do not ever worry about the end times or any other thing at all. Try this verse of Scripture: Romans Chapter 8 verse 28.
B00H8C3FTQ,Ronald Dillenburg "Ron D",5,Liked the the story even with the lesser grade CGI effects. Learned some things I did not know before watching.
B00H8C57GA,david schlapman,5,Anything Dr. Who related gets my vote. Anything that has lasted as long as the Dr Who saga is based on rock steady premise.
B00H8C57GA,Fast Freddy "Fred",5,Great stories. I can't wait until this series resumes.  I am always sorry to see the actor playing the Doctor leave but then I like the new one just as well.
B00H8C57GA,greg,5,As in all of doctor whos show I find my self totaly involved with what is going on. That's why I watch these things.
B00H8C57GA,G. Repetti,5,love Doctor Who....love this episode.  recommended for any fan of the show.  Doctor Who?  that is the quesiton on everyone's mind.
B00H8C57GA,Holly,5,I heart heart the doctor. This was a bitter sweet moment. Loved Matt Smith! Hated to see him go. Excited more will continue!
B00H8C57GA,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,No spoilers here. But this is a must see for doctor who fans. Well worth the purchase price. Enjoyed every second.
B00H8C57GA,lenmaster93,5,Like many others I was wondering how Moffat would get past the 12 regenerations rule so Peter Capaldi could take over for Matt Smith and he certainly didn't disappoint.
B00H8C57GA,L. J. Roberts,5,What a wonderful and perfect show for the 50th anniversary celebration.  I actually found myself applauding at the end and then watching it again.  I can't even say how many times I've now watched it but I never get tired of it.
B00H8C57GA,R. Young "LORD's Servant",5,This is another great episode.  Don't think I have seen a bad one yet. It does have a different spin/feel to it though.
B00H8V0FSQ,Danny L. Abernathy,4,recently a researcher decoded ten wordsthis may be something you can grab on tobut like the one who wrote itisn't it a great waste of time
B00H8V0FSQ,Kentucky D. "Uncle D.",2,I found it so boring from the very start that I didn't even watch it all. Total waste of time.
B00H8V0FSQ,Sherry H.,5,I enjoyed learning the story of this odd manuscript.  There is a lot of information contained in it that needs to be deciphered
B00H8XP4W6,Nancy Gambrell,5,I have enjoyed this show very much and I hope to see more episodes In 2014/2015 Mr. Foyle is a detective
B00H8XP4W6,Romona Burton,5,Best show ever.  Excellent writing acting I loved it. There has been a better tv  program in years. I enjoyed them.
B00H9IO0X4,Amazon Customer,5,I just love this show and I'm very upset that it is being cancelled.  This show has so many possibilities that they never explored.  Please bring it back again!
B00H9IO0X4,colleen,5,Always so much going on! I never get bored watching this show and that's why I have rated it like I have.  Read my post on season 3.  Having a marathon over a weekend watching each and every episode is way fun for me.
B00H9IO0X4,David Asensio,5,i love this show i was a fan of the british series then they stopped but the American series is excellent i think the stories are great it so similar and so different at the same time if you like the british series you like the this one check it out you might like it(yeah you will!)
B00H9IO0X4,Heather Scott,5,I love this show great story line actors are good too always laughing they gave the characters unique sarcastic-ish senses of humor that fit the roles perfectly
B00H9IO0X4,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,Before watching this I tried to watch the other could not do it then somehow I started watching this and a much improvement what more can you ask for vampires werewolves and a ghost living regular lives of supernatural porpotions
B00H9IO0X4,K.S. "Sunshine",5,It is science fiction TV show which is my favorite genre. It's interesting to watch since I watch episodes on Season 1 to present.
B00H9IO0X4,Kyaruzi,5,Fantastic comeback. But I wish it was renewed! Screw syfy. At least it planned for cancellation. Which is sad. It has potential.
B00H9IO0X4,Michael Richardson,4,I also enjoyed the original.  They have done a good job of being creative with the story in this re-make.
B00H9IO0X4,Rene',4,I can see why this show is ending here.  This season has been weak compared to the previous seasons. Too bad.
B00H9N22IO,Helen J Powers,3,Abby is doing what she said in season 2 she wouldn't with the team replacements. Christie is the star. We bet on what she will say next. No one does a smart ass comment like her. You want to feel good watching. The show was more fun earlier. Also I paid for prime just to watch this show and justified.. then I don't know if I can even watch them anyway
B00H9N22IO,Lynn,5,I like the show but I think amazon charges too much for it socially when you've already  paid eighty dollars a year for membership
B00HALOZIA,A. Joseph Orlando,1,Giving a reason why this movie is all kinds of awfulness would be a disservice to anyone reading this review because quite simply I had to shut it off after 20 minutes. It was that bad.
B00HALOZIA,bbrockRailFan "Brian Brocksmith",4,I rented this movie not expecting too much. It had some pretty good fight scenes. The ending was what truly made the movie. Not a cinematic classic but worth watching once. The acting wasnt too great but if you like to see fairly attractive women beat the stuffing out of each other then watch this one.
B00HALOZIA,mistic,5,very interesting exciting film keeps viewers at the edge of their seats. Good movie to watch dont miss out on it
B00HALOZIA,Movie 2'sday,4,Good movie!! Plenty of buh hitches making other buh hitches their buh hitches so if you like buh hitch on buh hitch buh hitch fighting and such then you will like this kinda buh hitching movie!!
B00HARFMU4,Robert Gammon,5,Combination of CGI and NASA plus ESA footage that creates a magical perspective on what mankind's past and possible future space exploration
B00HARFMU4,Ronald L. Montes "Ron The Tech",5,I'm really into anything having to do with space and the universe.  And there is image after amazing image of the wonders of space.  The music isn't all that great and it's not in HD but very tranquil.&#8203;
B00HASYDK8,Alera Red,5,All I can do is pipe in with everyone else and yell &#34;6 seasons and a movie.&#34;  :) I have officially joined the bandwagon.
B00HASYDK8,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,I usually don't watch many comedies nowadays everything so common but starting watching this just checking it out and was hooked from first episode it is stupid hilarious and good actors real likable even the &#34;bad guys&#34; have likable moments
B00HAYWNY0,Marilyn Lee "The BookRook",5,I am in such an isolated area and can relate.  Love the historical research and directness of this TV series!  Keep more coming!!
B00HBJ9XGU,JD GAYMAN,5,The Ridels are always good for drama. The pomrankies are doing what they do the best get the gold. This is a great season for nome
B00HBJ9XGU,Karen,5,I can't get enough of it! The quality of the video is great also. Good job Discovery Channel. I'll watch every episode.
B00HD6QSM8,C. Roderick,1,I love Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling&#8230;this movie tries to be interesting&#8230;but never succeeds&#8230;.my husband refused to keep watching&#8230;.had to see the end myself following day&#8230;sad to see such actors and such effort putting together a movie and then to fail so&#8230;..
B00HD6RLBK,Amanda C.,3,I didn't watch the earlier seasons but was able to catch up with what was happening in current season.  It is a good one to watch to kinda waste the day.  Actors do a good job with their characters and the story line is good if you are into syfy.
B00HD6RLBK,Amazon Customer,5,I love this show.  Every season gets better and better!  Keep it coming for years to come please!  I love Stiles!
B00HD6RLBK,Angela Anderson,5,I really enjoy watching Teen Wolf but missed an episode that explained what was happening in the current episode. I'm now able to follow this storyline a lot better.
B00HD6RLBK,bob is dead,3,good show.
B00HD6RLBK,boto,5,I just have to say that I love Teen Wolf.
B00HD6RLBK,Calley Wenzel,5,This season I really like because Scott is an Alpha now and he has stepped up to defend the people in his town and the people in his pack. Thanks
B00HD6RLBK,carrie,5,so is awesome.watch it with my kids best fun had in awhile glad its on.hope goes forever.wish more like it
B00HD6RLBK,Heather P. Fraser,5,I think that the writing is fabulous on this show and the characters engaging. Scott and Stiles give the bromance concept a whole other definition.
B00HD6RLBK,jay,3,Show is good and bad but then again most are must watch if u like wearwolf shows good acting overall
B00HD6RLBK,JLH4,5,Excellent series very surprised.  Story line and extra episodes ties all of the story together.  The characters really grow together
B00HD6RLBK,Keats,5,IT IS SO AMAZING OMG I JUST LOVE HOW AMAZING AND AWESOME THIS SHOW IS HOLY MOTHER OF GOD IT IS SO GOOD
B00HD6RLBK,Mary E. Henry "Sci-fi fan",3,Although I love Teen Wolf I don't know if I like the direction it is taking. I like the Japanese angle but I do not like Stiles' storyline.
B00HD6RLBK,Mike suell,5,Great kick assl
B00HD6RLBK,Nicole Smith,5,Love it. Every season gets better and better.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great watch for the whole family.
B00HD6RLBK,R. OSullivan,5,Believe or not its a super scary season. The shows evolves from corny to very visually disturbing but provides a lot of entertainment. A little confusing but a lot of fun. Might not want to watch right before bedtime p and that's coming from a grown up who got creeped out this season.
B00HD6RLBK,rsbinscarth,3,I really liked the first season of TW.  I do not like the sexual freedoms used and if it continues I will not watch this show any longer.
B00HD6RLBK,S. Heath,5,The series has taken a dark spin and I love it. The series just keeps getting better and better. I love the Kitsune addition. I love foxes!
B00HD6RLBK,Sue,4,At first it was a little confusing and I did not like how the characters became confused all the sudden.  The next few episodes got better and now more easy to follow.  I would watch it again.
B00HJ1B90I,ed schreiber,3,Need more series like this. Not finished with this one.Is good at holding my interest in the plots and cases.
B00HJ1B90I,Sandra Martinez,4,This show is very interesting...great compilations of extreme cases. I definitely recommend this show for anyone with interest in the criminolgy field.
B00HJ1B90I,Shelley Danica Black "Race it & take it!!!",4,I liked it because there were many celebrities that I did not know that totally did some weird schuff!! Weird!
B00HMCLQMA,Amazon Customer,4,It keeps me interested and I enjoy the well developed storyline.  I always want to watch another episode. Never bored!
B00HMCLQMA,Amy NY1,5,Your seat wanting more series . It was well written and the acting was well done . I was not bored to death with this series part 1 I zipped through it wanting more .
B00HMCLQMA,Anne Deaton "Maggie - Cocker Momma",5,Realistic and all too possible. This show fascinates and leaves the viewer hungry for the next episode...Hope this one is a keeper for  the network!
B00HMCLQMA,Belinda Roman,5,Finally!  We have a great new Sci Fi idea and program.  Let's hope they can keep up the quality for more than one season.
B00HMCLQMA,E. Magno,3,A run of the mill SiFy &#34;the world is coming to an end because those guys are experimenting with stuff they should leave alone.&#34; Its a cross between Andromeda Strain and the original &#34;The Thing&#34; which were far superior to this and the hundreds of copy cats that have followed.
B00HMCLQMA,Gerbear,4,Interesting
B00HMCLQMA,Glenn H. Duncan,4,When I rented this series I was hooked at the start interested in seeing where it leads. Bought the whole season.
B00HMCLQMA,Jean Marcel Ducharme,5,I shouldn't have to explain why I like or love each show. How many stars should be enough. I love the show.
B00HMCLQMA,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",4,I like this not quite sure if I would qualify it as supernatural as much as science fiction but seems to have an unique spin to it but can be confusing who is the bad guy or good guy learn to see things in grey areas
B00HMCLQMA,Mike suell,5,Ready for season 2
B00HMCLQMA,Ricardo Serrano "Photogeek",4,I like the pace and mystery of this show.  You don't really get a good idea of where it's going til the middle of the season.  My friends said this show just got too crazy but I found it entertaining.
B00HMCLQMA,S. Fox "oyee",1,It just wasn't that interesting and seemed to rely on soap operaish drama queen style drama.More huh?  Real stinky.
B00HMCLQMA,ZZrider,2,I watched the first episode and that was enough.  Be warned there are some spoilers so don't read on if you want to watch.If you want to watch intelligent drama this isn't it.  They find out that it isn't airborne so they take their head gear off.  I wouldn't be so fast to do so since what if it's through skin contact or ingestion?  They wander around without head gear and come across a Monkey  loose in a room.  Wouldn't you think the Monkey might be infected?  They try to catch it and I love Monkeys as much as the next person but the lady practically lip locks the thing.  I could go on but you get the point.  I won't be watching any more of this.
B00HMVFAIM,Classic City Cockatiels "Classic City Tiels",5,This was the perfect way to view what these brothers are doing with their search on this cursed island. Aired new to 2014 and did not disappoint!!  Was excited to be able to view for mere pennies each week on AMAZON versis trying to watch on one of those free (do the ad) web sites.  Is a story line for sure that holds your attention.
B00HMVFAIM,Preacher Morris,4,I have only seen one episode but it looks promising. I feel this series could get real stagnant or the producers could go outrageous with made up problems.
B00HMVFAIM,Shelley Danica Black "Race it & take it!!!",4,Good season! Wish there were more seasons! I really like the dynamic between the brothers and the rest of the crew!
B00HN1IM90,Victoria J. Dennison,4,The short was well done.  The photography was good and the scenes were artistic and disturbing.  The story was good and it was simple.  The whole story was creepy and the ending was unnerving. To me it was well worth watching.
B00HNEBCHG,BHoward,5,These girls are raunchy and great!  I love women who are not afraid of being themselves-funny and dysfunctional!  Too great.
B00HNEBCHG,Lee Haskell,5,I didn't tune in until one night when I had no idea what I was watching - (episode 9 when they go to the bank) but I heard  the Thrift shop song and these two dressed in that 80's get-up - I was sold right there and then.  Don't understand why Comedy Central isn't airing repeats for us latecomers.
B00HNEBCHG,Thomas,3,Should not be compared to 'Girls" but rather the above noted show. Hope it is given a chance to grow. Acting lessons would help some though much stronger in second show. Not bad overall. Actually quite funny.
B00HNEBLCC,John T Robinson,4,I don[t understand why ABC cancelled this. I know that ratings were low but I found this to be an interesting show and looked forward to seeing all of it.
B00HNEBLCC,Patricia Duhon "art lover",5,Enjoyed the first  episodes and remember when the news of this came out....Well done drama with truth behind it....Bring it back please.
B00HNEBLCC,swr4pink "swr4pink",4,I am sorry this show was cancelled.  I would be interested in the other six episodes if Amazon will make them available.
B00HNEBLCC,William R. Toddmancillas,3,See the expression on this main character's face.  It NEVER changes.  Boring!!  No wonder it was taken off the air.
B00HNXZ1EM,Anubis,5,This is by far the best police show since &#34;Third Watch&#34;.  This show is intense and hopefully will run for the next 10+ years.  The crossover done with Chicago Fire was brilliant.  Dick Wolf is a great writer and I look forward to the new episodes for season 2.  Watch this show from the beginning as you will see everything unfold.
B00HNXZ1EM,B. Merrill,5,Its hard to get enough of this show. Its not your typical police drama there seems to be a lot more going on. I honestly cant wait for season 2..
B00HNXZ1EM,JW-169,5,I like the casting and all the episodes and the way things happen you know typical crime fighting going down in old Chicago.  I also like it because Chicago Fire is in some of the episodes too & vice versa...
B00HNXZ1EM,LOUISE,4,Good Tv show. I enjoyed watching it. Looks a lot like actuality. I would watch it again. Give it a four star.
B00HNXZ1EM,Nick,3,bought a ep of the show because of it having a crossover with another one. It seems to be an okay show to watch.
B00HNXZ1EM,Patricia Wollweber,5,The girls are good looking and the guys are nice also.  I would like to see Aaron with the gal from chicago fire.  Love my cop shows.  Like where alot of the actors and actresses off Chicago Fire guest star on this show.  Hope it becomes a big hit.
B00HNXZ1EM,Paula Jankowski,4,Not one of my very favorite itBut I do like most of the actorsI like the blonde guy the best and will watch because of him
B00HNXZ1EM,RAM,5,I love Chicago Fire and Chicago PD and that some characters cross over. I look forward to watching it every week!
B00HNXZ1EM,William Hodges,4,The only issue I have with the show is that it highlights the supervisor as a crooked cop and tries to make him out to be a good guy. I enjoy the story lines but think in many ways it sends the wrong message to the younger watchers.
B00HNZHPGC,Amazon Customer,4,I did not expect much when I first started watching this. I was surprised how good this show is. The main characters are the engine of this show. The wolf stuff is secondary.  Take a look. You might like it.
B00HNZHPGC,Amazon Customer,5,I love anything supernatural and this show hits the nail on the head!  The actors are believable and good looking to boot! The action sequences are fabulous and the story lines are terrific.
B00HNZHPGC,bob is dead,1,stupid show.
B00HNZHPGC,Carolyn Amos,5,I enjoyed watching the first season of Bitten and was disappointed that it might not be a second season. I really liked the story line. And every time an episode ended I couldn't waite for the next one
B00HNZHPGC,David Asensio,5,Kelley Armstrong books come to life i love her series of the other world i was sorry to see it end but now the tv spin off is great see the characters in action is amazing the cast picks are very well done done even Jeremey(he not be asian looking with black hair but i think the actor they chose is doing a great job)Clay and Elena are perfect picks i can't wait to see to it all play out if your into sci/action shows this is a good one to check out you don't have to be a fan of her books to follow it i can't for mondays as the new episodes come out
B00HNZHPGC,Larry Baker,1,What a waste of money this show is.  Its more about a naked blond than any real story line at all.
B00HNZHPGC,Lawman,5,Was bored one night and started watching this. This is a great show with lots of action and a good back story. We'll worth a look for anyone who enjoys werewolfs.
B00HNZHPGC,Mike suell,5,Love this show
B00HNZHPGC,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",4,So far this is really good and I am enjoying it immensely.  A man has a computer chip in his brain which makes him able to do things that are far from ordinary.
B00HPPVJTY,Lynn,5,Love this show!!!!!  I hope it shows on Hulu though or I won't be able to watch anymore.  I don't have cable and don't get many channels so depend on Hulu or Netflix
B00HPPVNHM,B. Merrill,5,This is a very amusing comedy great mix of politics and court room drama with a ton of funny experiences.  The character mix in this show is phenomenal. Keagan is always getting into some crazy escapade. You wont be disappointed.
B00HPPVNHM,Dangerman "Dan G.",4,This show's going to take a while to develop but it's headed in the right direction.  It's starting to find its legs and is different from all other network comedies with sharp dialogue and adult situations.  Greg Kinnear holds the show together and he has a great supporting cast including the talented John Ortiz.
B00HPPVNHM,Fish,5,I love the original Australian show Rake and I was prepared to be disappointed with the American remake.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Greg Kinnear is brilliant in this version.  It is almost as good as the original and MUCH better than 99% of the garbage infesting television these days.
B00HPPVNHM,Tim Johnson,4,well written and funny - Greg Kinnear is a great actor.... nice for a show to break with the normal PC bull$#it
B00HPRPBLY,BHoward,4,I love teen mom for the drama.  I can't help it!  I wish for more and more seasons of these girls!
B00HPRPBLY,Charlene Perdue,5,I love this show.  I think all young kids should watch and see what goes on when you decide to have a child at such a young age.  Im so glad MTV decided to do this series and I hope they continue on and come out with a follow up to the season one cast also
B00HPRPBLY,TaydeeBee,4,Love this show! Especially Chelsea she has such great style. Jennelle is an idiot though and I can't stand watching her pieces of the show.
B00HPRPBLY,Winston C Cooke Jr,1,I would never even allow this on my TV if it were up to me but my wife likes to order these kind of &#34;family values&#34; TV shows behind my back while I'm at work.
B00HQ2GBLM,Adele Dodd,4,This romantic chick flick comedy was very well put together.  I would have been better without the bedroom scene between Kevin and Mindy but still nothing happened and it turned out a halfway decent and funny show.  I would recommend this to only adults but not children and teenagers.  Although it was decent and no nudity it still is the role model of a show I would allow a teenager or child to watch.
B00HQ2GBLM,Deltasunset,3,I wanted to like this movie a lot more than what I did. I didn't think I knew the cast but quickly remembered Micheal Rady as one of Casey's boyfriends from Greek. He's a real cutiepie. Then of course I am a Suits fan and the supporting actress is charming in that show. Mildly amusing. I used to work some in film and I thought there were some odd camera angles; these often made the lead actress much less attractive than she really was.I say it was medium. On the plus side there was no bad language.
B00HQ2GBLM,Kari Hampton,4,Definitely a cute chick flick and worth the time to watch it. Definitely not something that I would ask my husband to watch with me.
B00HQ2GBLM,Matein Movies,4,RANDOM ENCOUNTERSSERENDEPITOUS! Basically the same story with a different angle of Serendipity the Movie with John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale in 2001. Both  movies very enjoyable.
B00HQ2GBLM,meg,4,This was a cute movie. I would recommend it.
B00HQBOL60,Amazon Customer "spedteach",5,I love this show!  I like the main character and glad to see she has a love interest which to me makes the show more interesting and realistic. I also  really like the concept of a woman being the &#34;bad guy&#34;.  I really hope the network will give this show a chance to thrive.
B00HQBOL60,JW-169,4,Would like to see the Series continue. Because you don't see a whole about the Texas Rangers And I think Tricia Helfer is a great actress. And it's another good sitcom I guess people don't know how to enjoy..
B00HQBOL60,rcowgirl,5,This show has a strong lead woman with well developed characters around her. ABC made the mistake of canceling this show before letting the people get invested in the story. I would love to see another network pick it up and continue what the show has started. (love to see Jake put in his place by Molly and Dan)
B00HQBOL60,Terrance L. Mcgowan,4,It was a bit bloody and becomes a soap opera with the heroine trying to get her husband to sign off on their divorce papers.  But otherwise just a fund shootem up bang bang type story.
B00HQMWE40,Erik Therme (author of Mortom),4,A worthy addition the the series!
B00HQMWE40,Stacie Ridings,5,My whole family enjoys Duck Dynasty.  My daughter's favorite is Uncle Si.  This show is funny and in the situations that are resolved with the family eating together at the end.
B00HQMWE40,Susan Duffy,4,I don't know if it's just me but this season just doesn't seem as funny as previous seasons.  But it is still good.  I like the sense of family values that they show.
B00HQMWE40,The1and0nly,1,I mean don't get me wrong I love ducks but why don't they shoot anteaters? They have been a serious problem in this country with the recent outbreak of anteaters in north Dakota back in 75. I feel like the anteaters and ducks will team up one day and what do you know its terminator all over again we are sorry we did not listen James Cameron!!!!!
B00HQQOLSS,Daniel D Duran,5,It's week old episodes and don't cover every day but it's still a great show that every body love.  Witty and insightful as ever.
B00HQQOLSS,Rebecca Snell "boulder50",5,Very informative.  The people picked to be on the show are interesting and the books informative.  Will look as long as the show is on
B00HQQOLSS,Richardao,5,I know this is a comedy show but for me it is the best news/comedy show.Jon Stewart does a fantastic job in presenting how some news showspresent their version of the news. The interviews are great.I recommend this program for news and entertainment.
B00HQQOLSS,Stanley Fernandes,5,Jon Stewart is very funny.  Political humor.  I especially like that I can watch it for free on Amazon Prime.  Thanks Amazon!
B00HQQOLSS,Susan Duffy,5,I guess if you you watch cable news especially Fox News and believe it to be the word of god; then your not going to like The Daily Show.  But it is a very funny satirical look at current events in the news.  In fact they quite often show out takes from cable news companies and how they present the news.  Sometimes they talk about what is not mentioned compared to what is mentioned and ask why?
B00HQQOLSS,Theresa Inziello "Tracy2.0",5,Jons always insightful and to the point we get it. Love the interviews there always up-to-the-minute.  Never a dull moment.
B00HQRCBP2,Christine,5,My teenaged children even enjoy watching The Colbert Report with us.  It's entertaining and gets them interested in current events.
B00HQRCBP2,CLAUDE H TOWNSEND JR,1,After a while you just get feed up with this style of humor. Am really surprised he is still on TV
B00HQRCBP2,Stanley Fernandes,5,Colbert is very funny.  You have to realize that it is satire.  Highly recommended if you like political humor and making fun of DC.
B00HQRCBP2,Susan Duffy,5,Stephen Colbert is a gifted performer who is able to bring current news topic in comical way while satirizing the conservative noise machine.  i especially like when he offers a twisted view of a current event and then to backup his point of view he will show clips from conservative news agencies such as Fox News to support his point of view.
B00HQRCBP2,Theresa Inziello "Tracy2.0",5,Colbert is always  Entertaining. He keeps us informed on the most important matters. And always with a lot of wit.
B00HQSWMS2,Debbie Dillon,4,I've watched the first 4 episodes and I like it so far. It is similar to Project Runway but different enough to be enjoyable. I'll watch it to the end and then make a final judgment.
B00HQSWMS2,juicy,5,Way better than I thought it would be.  The person who won is the one who should have.  And it's just as entertaining as Project Runway - every bit as good.
B00HSEZ49I,Linda Adams,4,Good family show.
B00HSEZ49I,Mery,5,The deaf and hearing adds so much more to a story that's already so intriguing. My boyfriend and I both love it-it's actually are favorite abc family show and considering we don't have kids and love it really says something!
B00HSEZ49I,NC. movie man,5,I watched season 1 and 2 on netflix plus bought 3 on amazon started watching on friday all way till Sunday started back again over again with my son that's how good it is.
B00HSEZ49I,rg,3,They are still  being reasonably real and getting along decently. And Are yet a good watch. I don't miss an episode myself.
B00HSUOZS8,Amy,5,I love watching them make some amazing creations. It is amazing what they can do. A great family show friendly show
B00HSUOZS8,Katherine Young,5,This season they are proving that they have real talent! They are not performing like rookies at all! Love it!
B00HSUOZS8,KatieHepburn,5,This is a program showing on SYFY Channel in which anyone over the age of 18 can compete for best Science Fiction Make-up Artist.  The prize are significant and the competitions are amazing.  Don't miss this one if you like this kind of thing.
B00HSUOZS8,Timothy Black,5,This is an excellent show! I have been a big fan since the first season! I would recommend anyone that likes special effect in movies and TV shows to watch it!
B00HSV20KC,Aimee,4,SO bummed this show didn't get picked up.  I was really really liking it!!!  I know others feel the same.
B00HTYTVD2,Glen Pridgen,5,Who knew that the Walburgs had a quiet family member. Paul is a cool dude who rounds out the family nicely. If you have ever worked in the food service business then you will appreciate this show.
B00HTYTVD2,Lauren Michele,5,Even thought an occasional scene that might be scripted it's still a great show.  Good. Clean. Laughs.  That's hard to come by in reality tv these days.
B00HTYTVD2,pattk77,3,The Wahlburgers seem down to earth for how much they're worth. Cool Irish Americans like myself. Seems like you could have a beer and a laugh with them but the episodes repeat themselves and are a bit corny at times. Mostly about light drama and ribbing each other. I think every episode has brushed on family dinners at the table. It's just not that appealing really. My wife likes it more than me.
B00HUF9R52,Charles J. Mcpeak "mcpeak2",5,Different but still hilarious! I am glad to know the show is going back to ISIS though.
B00HUF9R52,Christopher R. Williams,5,Archer is beyond the coolest show ever made :-)i could have done without the 3 minute long spoiler at the end of the first episode though :-) lol still insane awesome though.
B00HUF9R52,Consumer 45,5,Best show besides Mythbusters!  Watched reruns and new shows without a second thought. Plays on iPad Air and numbers 2 and 4 with ease! Beautiful video quality and I do not even spend on the HD versions. Amazon is fast becoming my favorite download place with Apple iTunes second!!
B00HUF9R52,David Asensio,5,i love Archer season 5 so far it makes me laugh everybody is so bad at being criminal it's hilarious i can't wait for the new episodes because it takes a whole week but when it comes it worth it
B00HUF9R52,Dean W. Wood,5,I love the Archer series. It is great adult humor. The twist with Lana being pregnant is a great twist and Pam being thin and sexy is a good new addition. It is a great different road from the past 4 seasons. Keep up the great work.
B00HUF9R52,JD Homewolf,5,I can't get enough of this. Every line is sooo inappropriate and insulting to someone! The writers are genius and I would love to have a beer with any one of them...I'll buy;)
B00HUF9R52,JT,1,Since Amazon does not provide a way for season purchasers to leave reviews per episode I have to tell you that this review is for "Filibuster":"Filibuster" is the worst Archer episode yet.And I've seen them all. The appearance of Krieger usually bails out a flagging episode. Not this time. Don't know how Reed managed to put multiple Krieger's in an episode and still have it nosedive into the ground but he did.This season wreaks.
B00HUF9R52,M. Mara,5,Archer is one of the funniest shows on tv. Truly laugh out loud funny. Start with season one because this season goes off on a tangent but I hear that next season will be back to spying. But even this season is great. Just ignore the one star reviews because most of them are complaints from fans who are angry that FX put one 15 second ad for another show at the beginning...NOT a reason to one star a show from people who love it.
B00HUF9R52,Randall von Schoeler "Garden Guru",5,I have been glued to every episode of every season.  The show is so well written.Starting out a bit slower than what I was expecting.  But I think I've watched every episode of all seasons maybe 10 times.  Archer addict.
B00HUF9R52,Victoria Gates "Victoria",4,When ISIS gets shut-down by the FBI the ISIS team turns to selling cocaine out of Cheryl's family mansion. Obviously it all goes wrong.. plus Pam gets skinny and Lana is pregnant so... Just watch Archer.
B00HUF9R52,Zain Naboulsi Jr. "zainnab",1,I cancelled my season pass for last year and will not buy this year because I DON'T PAY FOR COMMERCIALS. Fire the person who thought it was a good idea.
B00HUKCIAS,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I don't know why but this show makes me laugh. I just wish Riley would pick the right brother and I'm sorry but it's not Ben. Funny cast of characters.
B00HUKCIAS,Becky,5,I like this show the same as season 1 and season 2.  It makes me laugh. This show helps me get threw my grief.
B00HUKCIAS,Lorena M,5,this show is so funny and the baby is so cute and  i still have not seen the end of the show
B00HUKCIAS,Tamara L Perez,5,I think this is the funniest show on air currently.  Thumbs up for having a good cast that keeps it funny throughout the show.  Some shows are funny for example Melissa and Joey is funny but I don't think it keeps my laughing through the entire show the way Baby Dady does.I'm really hoping Danny and Riley get together and stay together.  I totally see it going there before this show goes off the air.  Her and Ben didn't work.
B00HUNNYW6,ccc,5,i enjoyed watching the show and will continue to watch more episodes and keep updated as soon as possible nice.
B00HUNNYW6,Delma J Heiple "Umatillarivergal",3,One of those shows you can watch and leave and when you return you didn't miss anything. just a time killing show.
B00HUNNYW6,Gary W. Crane "Movie Lover",5,I feel this season 4 series was just as good as the previous 3. But I do hope they make some changes to keep the viewers keep coming back to watch the series and thus buy the dvds.
B00HUNNYW6,Genavee,5,I love this show and this season was the best one of all I can't wait for season 5!!! It was action filled from the beginning to the end with some really surprising moments! Two of my favorite characters was killed but I am expecting them to be brought back in season 5 because they couldn't have really killed Hale and Kenzie for real they are two of the main characters just like Bo and Dyson! I can't wait to see how they return!! So if you have watch this show before you should have a marathon and watch all four season before season 5 start!
B00HUNNYW6,JJ,2,When this show started it was fresh and really good.  Season 4 turned into something really stupid and just not right!  I doubt if it will make it to season 5.
B00HUNNYW6,Karen Robinson "Ivy",5,No matter what season I'm watching I just can't get enough and that is especially true for season 4. I love it!
B00HUNNYW6,KayLee Osgood,5,I love this show. I am addicted. It is one that you can watch over and over. It is awsome.
B00HUNNYW6,Mike suell,5,Good show
B00HUNNYW6,Rhinoman,3,This season was unraveled and the actors seem to have lost interest. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money.
B00HUNNYW6,samintochess,5,The characters have depth. The actresses are beautiful. The dialogue is realistic and up-to-date. The stories are interesting and the show hooks you with plot-twists and cliffhanger-style endings.
B00HUNNYW6,S. Heath,5,Lost girl is one of my favorite stories. I wished it would focus more on making the relationships a little more solid though.
B00HUNNYW6,Sue,5,The characters are what make the show.  The story plot usually keeps me guessing on what is going to happen next.  I like how the mix of humor and seriousness.  The sexual tension rocks.
B00HUNNYW6,Thomas Waring,5,I am very happy that we have a season 4 with Lost Girl. The show is exciting and interesting.The episodes are well written and the actors are perfect for the parts they play. Especially Anna Silk and Zoie Palmer. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is interested in seeing plots and acting that are more exciting and interesting then most of the shows on television. Watch it and you will see what I mean.
B00HWPYPA2,Carol,4,I watched this on a rainy afternoon and it did hold my interest.  All I can say is that it all works out in the end!!
B00HWPYPA2,Douglas W. Fielder,4,I really enjoyed this movie (must be my Celtic roots).....good comedic parts and nice emotional pace.  Loved the small town setting!
B00HWPYPA2,mjordan,3,Not the warm and fuzzy kind of show.  But it still had a decent plot and was entertaining for a couple of hours.
B00HWPZCZE,Cary B. Barad,4,An intriguing take on the police procedural/macabre child murder genre interspersed with very humorous asides and non sequiturs.  This film is a subtitled dark comedy that parenthetically gives the viewer some insight into the  upscale Israeli community and urban culture including the pursuit of vigilante justice among the law enforcement sector.  Very good performances by the many actors involved keep the suspense high while preventing things from  getting absurd.
B00HY7VG9G,Donald G. Siering,5,this show never stops &#34;shocking&#34; me...and now this season the cra cra's are popping up all over ...its like a train wreck.....you know you shouldnt watch but you just cant help yoyurself
B00HY7VG9G,Dona L. Sears "searsgig",5,gripping! but often shows the FBI task force as so obviously dumb
B00HY7VG9G,Eowyn,1,cheap shots and gratuitous violence do not equal a plot.  a waste of Kevin Bacon's talents.  I guffaw whenever the Joe character comes on screen.SPOILERS!!!teacher's pet:  does NO ONE ever die forever on this show...now Claire is alive too?  Snicker....
B00HY7VG9G,john charles &#34; chuck&#34; "john c scharri...,5,I'm a great fan of Kevin Beacon therefore I really enjoyed the entire season. I hope there will more following/
B00HY7VG9G,Kerry A. Barndt,5,Not for the squemish but my husband & I both really like The Following.  Never a dull moment - we don't miss any episodes.
B00HY7VG9G,K. Riemer "Mistress pandora",5,This show I never expected to like but had Kevin Bacon in it so figured it was worth a try fell in love with it constant surprises every time you think one thing something changes
B00HY7VG9G,Linda Saxton,4,This show is very good and exciting. Love the way the characters interact. Funny how all different types of people are drawn in.
B00HY7VG9G,Nancy Barrett,4,I am addicted to this very dark show and so happy to be able to see Keifer Sutherland every week.
B00HY7VG9G,Southern belle "southern belle",3,I followed at first; not it is getting redundant and no resolution ever occurs.  I guess I will still follow the Following but getting very bored with it.
B00HY7VG9G,Sunshine247365,4,Awesome!!! I can't wait to see what will happen next. I wasn't a big kevin bacon fan but I am now.
B00HY7VG9G,T. Brady "Tom",4,This has been one of the best shows on television.  There have not been to many of them lately but this one is in the top 3.  Each time I watch it I am glued to the seat wondering what will happen next and when it does happen...sometimes I jump from the unexpected that appears.  This continues to be an investment well worth it.  If you like suspense then you've come to the right place.
B00HY7VG9G,WkdMan,4,it was worth watching to find out what twisted new mass murder and which psychopath's followers were going to do the killing and to whom.Fairly twisted series of events that kept me waiting for the next episode.The last couple of episodes it seemed that the writers were struggling a little bit for new dialogue and catch phrases the action was enough to not get bored and wait to find out how things played out in the end.
B00HZKJK0Y,BHoward,5,My husband and I love this show.  These guys are always into crazy things.  Another good show is Broad City.  It comes on after Workaholics!
B00HZKJK0Y,Fawn Perry,5,Ha ha ha
B00I2CMJRK,Anna Pollock,5,First tweener show I could watch with my child. We don't even have the Nick channels on our lineup. This is a nice change of pace.
B00I2CMJRK,Diane,2,The story line could be great but is underdeveloped and then bad acting just ruins it.  By the way- the cafeteria at lunch time has more than 20 people in it.  Great actors coupled with Sherlock/encyclopedia brown type inventions by unique set of kids with diff skills would make a great show for a high school setting.
B00I2CMJRK,Diane Scarangella "diane",4,This is a very timely show.  The kids are great role models. Innovators and makers. And having a girl challenge the status quo to join this group is a real plus.
B00I2CMJRK,E. Easley "EZ Truth",4,This is funny and has interesting characters.  Looking forward to seeing more episodes.  Especially like the culturally diverse cast - great!
B00I2CMJRK,Gerald Weis,3,This show would be fine for kids to watch.  I enjoyed it and think most young people would think it is fine.  The teens in my house are a bit old for this humor and type of show but it's ok.
B00I2CMJRK,jman,1,This show I would never watch. I did not like it at all. that is not to say its bad just bad for me. enjoy and watch if you like it just leaving my review.
B00I2CMJRK,John Winner "JHW",2,Sophomoric is too grandiose for this series. It is meant for kids. I found it too stupid to watch. The characters seem like cartoon characters.
B00I2CMJRK,Noodler,1,The inventions are unrealistic. This show seems like silly fantasy masquerading as science. What's wrong with inventions that conform to physical reality? It takes real talent to make realistic and normal entertaining. This show gives the wrong messages to kids.
B00I2CMJRK,number one reader,1,I had a lot of trouble understanding what the kids were saying. It was like they said everything in fast forward. And the things they did were totally unrealistic. Maybe others will like this more than I do but to me it is kind of stupid.
B00I2CMJRK,ReaperMan,1,Don't really like the underlying tones of drug references and bullying. Not exactly how I think the pilot episode should be made. Seems in the opening since there is a kid selling candy to other kids and a bigger kid comes and tells him that her needs to get off his turf. Then pours milk in his bag of candy. Then they proceed to show the bully making bath tub candy. I don't think this was well thought out. And I immediately turned it off for these reasons. You will be amazed what kids pick up on. (Typed but not read)
B00I2CMJRK,robert robinson,3,I liked it but it would have been better in a cartoon because then the experience needed for the kids invention wouldn't have to be explain that much.
B00I2CMJRK,Toti,3,This show needs a little work. Tighten up the writing and make the characters more interesting. Otherwise it won't survive long term.
B00I2CMJRK,TWIXIE952 "Jan",2,This show is not going to get anything but some very bored flies .I don't like the script and the kids were bored.
B00I2CMJRK,W. Mcmanus,2,Not really something my family would watch. But it was ok. May find an audience of young kids that would like it.
B00I2GVDVY,Aislinn,5,This show has gotten increasingly better as the season has progressed. I hope that CBS is smart enough to renew it for a second season. It's Facebook page has been growing by leaps and bounds every day which should also tell them something. Wonderful ensemble cast.
B00I2GVDVY,April J. Rosenthal,5,I really enjoyed watching this show.  I enjoyed a character who was computer enhanced and maintained his humanity.  I am sorry the network did not agree.
B00I2GVDVY,a reader,3,Some of the character portrayals were just a bit to programmedseems to be getting betterreminded me much of the Lost Fleet types so might fit your style
B00I2GVDVY,Athena,1,Where did it go? Why would it be unavailable to stream after 5 episodes? Boo. And that is my last word.
B00I2GVDVY,dennis headley,1,Why did this title become unavailable with no prior notification of a availability window? This happens all too often and it is the one thing that keeps me on the fence about going all in with Amazon or going with all iTunes content instead.
B00I2GVDVY,DS "Say something about yourself!",5,I've bought into the characters and the concept.the writers have gone in some interesting directionsthis is sci-fi for grownups
B00I2GVDVY,Katmomma,3,Relies too much on the shock value of the implant aspect of the plot.  Needs serious character depth and development.  Long drawn out time consuming pauses are too often.  Too much filler replacing the above mentioned missing character development.
B00I2GVDVY,Peter Morrison "Love reading.",4,Surprisingly good.
B00I2GVDVY,Romona C. Bell,5,This series has great potential.  Interesting without being difficult to follow.  I look forward to watching it and seeing where the plot goes.
B00I2GVDVY,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",4,I really like this.  A man has a chip in his head that allows him to do far more than most himans.  He is a human computer.
B00I2GVDVY,Terrance L. Mcgowan,5,A new series for intelligent viewers.  Maybe his wife didn't turn.  Time will tell as the series continues.  Even if has been blown to bits.
B00I2GVDVY,Timothy J. Gannon,3,The main thing I like about this series in the personal chemistries. The computer chip implant is plausible; access to all dat not so much. The brain interaction with the chip is interesting. The long intro of characters and situation each episode is a waste of time and the action develops too slowly.
B00I2JFHRW,Amazon Customer,3,I love swamp people.  The first three shows of season five are not new though. They are replays of other seasons.
B00I2JFHRW,Geneva,5,Troy and all the crews are really getting it big time with some really fierce gators!! This is still the best reality show on TV!
B00I2JFHRW,June,5,I love all the people on the show. It shows how they are hard working people and they love their family.
B00I2JFHRW,pam,5,my husband and i have enjoyed swamp people from the start and this looks to be a good season again.
B00I2JFHRW,Preacher Morris,4,This is a decent show.  Interesting because it is shows a job that is so foreign to most of the viewers.
B00I2JFHRW,William Hodges,5,This is my wife's favorite show. We have a son in-law that is from Louisiana and she pick on him about living in the swamp.
B00I3IUC3Q,Angel Mom,4,It's so cute. Tommy is so adorable. They talk so cute. I love how he wants to lead the team.
B00I3IUC3Q,Cindy Gentry,1,This just appeared in my video library. I believe I was charged like $1.99 for this but have no idea how this purchased! There is not even a kid in the house who might have ordered this
B00I3M1IA8,Amazon Customer,4,My kids absolutely loooveee the first episode! They are begging me for more. We can only watch the first episode so many times!
B00I3M1IA8,Emily Marek Oswald,5,I can see this doing very well for young girls around the ages of 4 - 6. Move over Dora!
B00I3M1IA8,Genavee,5,My little daughter could watch this for hours! She love it! It has a great message! She shares it with her friends!
B00I3M1IA8,Gigi123,1,I can see why it lasted a few episode.  It just was not an attention grabber and my son walked away after less than 5 min of it playing.
B00I3M1IA8,robert robinson,3,I think that the show was nice  but it had no educational value. Young kids in school need to grow up in the real world and not a fairytale one. It would be okay for younger kids that's not in school as long as their parents tell them that it's all make believe. Sometime it's good to make believe as long as you know that's what you're doing. Good luck.
B00I3M1IA8,Toti,5,This show has a great lead character in Bianca. She is going to be the new Dora so have plenty of dolls and other merchandise ready at the stores. Very well thought out and the illustrations are beautiful. The story line is easy to follow and the songs are very catchy.
B00I3MMLHC,JH,5,Loved it from the first scene. Just having a hard time with everyone smoking. Please consider lightening g that up like they did in Mad Men. Thanks
B00I3MMLHC,Kathryn L Khanzadeh,5,I enjoyed this program very much.  The acting is great and Bosch is very much as I imagined him in the books.  I hope to see more of Harry Bosch.
B00I3MMN4I,Adam,5,Best new apocoliptic show yet. I really hope this gets made into a series I will watch it religiously. A must see
B00I3MMN4I,Alera Red,1,Great actors and good cinematography.  Horrible plot line and stupid characters.  The writers need to be more creative than dropping the F word to fill up the time.  It made the actors seem like stutters with Tourette Syndrome.  If at all possible avoid this show.  There are better apocalyptic shows to spend your time on.
B00I3MMN4I,Amazon Customer "Busy Person",5,This was a fast paced show that kept our interest. It has a feel similar to &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. We are hoping that this one gets picked up so we can see how it turns out.
B00I3MMN4I,Amazon Customer,5,A well combined cast makes this fresh look at a by now somewhat familiar theme keep your interest from start to finish. I wanted nothing more for days than to know why? Of course that the mark of good writing. Give this one a shot. I think you have a winner on your hands.
B00I3MMN4I,Amazon Customer,5,I can't wait to see where this show goes... it could be bad but I am familiar with a lot of the actors and their previous roles. I'm really hoping this is good.
B00I3MMN4I,Amazon Customer,5,I found the characters interesting. The premise is interesting. It was the end that really got me. I want to know what is going on with everyone.
B00I3MMN4I,Amazon's Fan(s),5,Make more !  I like this so far.  ...and when are the kids shows we voted for last year coming out?  Thanks
B00I3MMN4I,A. Robinson "hotarobin",3,Off to an interesting start.  A sorta hybrid of Walking Dead and Under The Dome.The excessive foul language is simply painful to the ear however.Some film makers seems have this misconception that the more swearing there is in a film the more realistic it will be...it's can be a turn off.
B00I3MMN4I,Athena Lee Brown "Lady of the Owls",5,I started watching and was a bit puzzled on what was going on.  I had to keep watching and boy am glad I did the ending has made me want to see what comes next and what the mystery thing was.  I would love to have my great nephews and niece watch with me am sure they would like it also.  Hope that this is not it for the show.
B00I3MMN4I,B.G. Arnold,3,It is hard to get into a story that seems to have no direction. Who do you root for and why? There was a good element of horror at the end but I felt the seed of the story was just too cliched.
B00I3MMN4I,Boricua,4,Excelent. This is a serie that you have to see. Good quality and great special effects. Congratulations to Amazon for made this wonderfull production. Still waiting for the continuity.
B00I3MMN4I,Brian T. Marino "Brian",5,Woo Chris Carter! I have been wondering what he has been up to. Such a great writer. Excellent ensemble. I've been hungering for a great show like this since Fringe left the air and Chris Carter is going to knock it out of the park.
B00I3MMN4I,CareTaker,2,Saw the Pilot. For most part it dragged. Don't see why there was so much cursing. It was simply distracting. Silly encounters such as pointing gun at guard to get him to open the hotel door. Don't this this will survive.
B00I3MMN4I,carla cribb,5,I really liked the suspense and the action that was included in the pilot. I am hooked and can not wait to continue with this show
B00I3MMN4I,Carlos Sullivan,5,Looks like a setup for post rapture earth.  Could be really good if they really go for it like they did with the pilot.
B00I3MMN4I,Chelley,4,Okay I almost turned off a few times but gave it a chance the ending was totally worth it. The show has potential will know for sure with the next few episodes.
B00I3MMN4I,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,the ending was so great!! I cannot wait until the next episode. i also see myself buying blu ray and instant video.bring back alpha house
B00I3MMN4I,Cole Parker,5,After is a very enjoyable show. I hope it wins. I can't wait to watch more. It will be interesting to see the &#34;event&#34; was... if we ever find out.
B00I3MMN4I,Daniel Clausen,5,I thought the pilot was great.  I love the mystery that the characters have to figure out and that some big things were revealed yet other points where made but not really discovered. I can't wait for the rest of this show.
B00I3MMN4I,DarylJr,4,Enjoyed the Pilot and would like to see another couple of episodes.  I liked the characters (mostly) and enjoyed the twists.  MORE PLEASE... and hey.. it is Chris Carter!!!
B00I3MMN4I,Dean R,2,Not thrilled with this show. I love Scifi but was disappointed with how this show played out. I probably won't watch this program if it makes it. I lost interest quickly.
B00I3MMN4I,Diane,2,Personally - I like these types of story lines.  This did not hold my attention and dragged on in my opinion.  Plot development lacked in keeping my interest.  I didn't understand what happened- then the alien- makes no sense all 8 wouldn't have some type of urgency for their families or loved ones - not realistic at all
B00I3MMN4I,Diane R.,2,the majority of the show consist of extras walking into each other in circles on a street were that many people wouldn't ever be at one time and the main characters not knowing why
B00I3MMN4I,Dlpearman,3,I was really disappointed with the set up. Stock characters thrown together. Without the big reveal in the final seconds I would have no interest in seeing more.
B00I3MMN4I,Dolores Taylor,5,I like this type of show to be entertained and just get away from all the bad news that is being broadcast on TV.  Once I got past the constant use of the bad language and just ignored it I found it an excellent show.  I do hope that there is more. It would be a shame to let us fans hanging with the surprise ending.
B00I3MMN4I,D. Robertson,4,There are a lot of shows along this same line right now but I have to admit this one has a more realistic theme based on the pilot.  The reactions to the events is very close to what you would probably see in reality
B00I3MMN4I,Dusguicheon "Baer",5,I have to admit I have a soft spot for this kind of show when it's done well and this one is done very well. .  So many shows of this genre start off well then fizzle out after a few episodes.  I hope this show gets made into a series and continues to keep up the mystery and excitement of the pilot.
B00I3MMN4I,EllaEmma,5,I just loved this!  A mix between the X-Files meets World War Z.  I really really really hope they turn this into a series!!  I'm going to be very upset if this one doesn't make it.
B00I3MMN4I,Erica L. Jablonsky,4,I was hesitant to watch this since there was only 1 episode but when i saw over 4000 reviews I figured it was a good risk to take because it would most likely be continued by Amazon. So glad I took the risk. This show has a lot going on and I am really not sure where it is going to take me but I'm addicted (already) and on the edge of my seat for the whole season!
B00I3MMN4I,FUBAR-EOD,5,Interesting pilot with a different approach on the &#34;Zombie Problem&#34;.  Will have to start watching the series to see where it goes to determine if I'll follow the series. LOOKS PROMISING RIGHT NOW!!
B00I3MMN4I,Gerald Weis,4,I really enjoyed watching this and the little character at the end of the pilot episode.  I hope we get a chance to see where they go with it.  The lady with the accent could use some acting lessons or be written out of the show - but if kept at least we have a brunette who is more worried about her phone than she is her safety.  So that is kind of like real life.  The battery is dead and she can't watch videos of her daughter anymore on it but she still wants her phone more than her life.  lol  I recommend this to anyone who likes this genre but if your not a walking dead kinda person it might not be for you.
B00I3MMN4I,gerry d lay,5,I loved the characters and the story. Excellent development so far i couldn't stop watching. I Will be waiting for the next episodes!
B00I3MMN4I,Glenn H. Duncan,4,Would have given it 5 but not sure where the plot is going yet. It has some interesting story lines and has a lot of potential. Can't wait to see what is next looking forward to next episode.
B00I3MMN4I,grant18,2,Perhaps fans of the gone but never-understood (by me) series &#34;Lost&#34; will have fun trying to decipher it but I can guarantee I won't be.
B00I3MMN4I,Jaffacree,5,Great story awsome twist At the end. They need to run with this series. I cant wait to see how it can turn out
B00I3MMN4I,James,5,Very good start and one our family cannot wait until the next show as we want to see what was that has the crew baffled.
B00I3MMN4I,Janette M. Guyre,4,I like the cast and there interaction but I don't want to see it become another Walikg Dead( which I really really like) but hope it can become some thing the first few seasons of Fringe or the XFiles
B00I3MMN4I,Jay Kenney "James J Kenney",5,This is Chris Carter at his VERY BEST! Great cast. Great writing. Great acting. Great production values. Great story! Pick it up!
B00I3MMN4I,JB,2,I wanted to try out Amazons new shows and I think this one is my least favorite of them all ...
B00I3MMN4I,JD Homewolf,5,I wasn't sure what to expect but I was hooked right away. Great job Amazon. I will be watching for more of this.
B00I3MMN4I,jeff,5,great show very different hope there are more episodes for this one. exciting and you can never guess whats going to happen
B00I3MMN4I,J. Griffiths,2,Most of this show is about a group of people freaking out about being locked in a parking garage. There's a little scifi at the end but it wasn't worth waiting for.
B00I3MMN4I,Joe 1015,5,Great pilot episode. Left me hungry for more. So many questions to be answered and it seems to be a good recipe for many different stories and subplots. Highly recommended to sci-fi and mystery fans.
B00I3MMN4I,John N,4,Liked it until . . . that thing appeared.  This one had a promising opening sequence until they got to the rich ladies house then it devolved into stereotypes and a devil thing.So it's another end of the world show.  I think that makes 10 new shows on this topic.
B00I3MMN4I,jrodie,5,This has the a chance to be a great series. It has a great start of something very different and new that could be great if the show is continued with more of the same thrilling new ideas.
B00I3MMN4I,JSB,4,I really enjoyed the episode.  The characters and stories were interesting enough that I would definitely watch more episodes if it was made into a full series.
B00I3MMN4I,Kizmet64,4,I liked this series and would recommend that it be developed.  It kept you on the edge of your seat and I found the characters interesting and believable.  The alien was especially cool.
B00I3MMN4I,KMOJR,4,My girlfriend and I really enjoyed watching this pilot and we would definitely watch every episode if it were greenlit. The main actress is great! My biggest criticism is the way that weird demon thing looked at the end. It looked kinda cheesy like it was rushed or a beta version of what they wanted it to look like.
B00I3MMN4I,kos,5,Sci-fi fans have been waiting for Chris Carter to have a follow up to the X-Files for a long time. The After is that show.Something has happened that has shutdown all of the power. We later find out that the water has been shut off also. The After is the story of eight strangers that meet in a building and what happens to them.There's a surprise at the end that might make some people on the fence want to see more.
B00I3MMN4I,Larry Thompson "Seeker",5,Carter is extremely good at drawing the audience in and not giving everything away.  This show is like that; you get interested and really want to see where it goes.  The various ramifications involved in this post-apocalyptic puzzler could keep this show going for years.  The acting and casting were superb.
B00I3MMN4I,Lawrence Tuczynski "godzillamusic",4,Watched this pilot and thought it was pretty decent. I'd watch if it got made into a series as long as it was part of Prime and not $1.99 per episode.
B00I3MMN4I,Leevora,5,That was one of the coolest looking alien's I've ever seen!!  Couldn't help but think of Face Off! When will more episodes show.  I'm anxious to see what happens next!  Great pilot.
B00I3MMN4I,Lorri Robinson,4,I enjoyed it and I'm interested in seeing how it works out. It is a bit similar to some other post apocalypse shows but with enough uniqueness to keep me coming back.
B00I3MMN4I,Marc Campbell "mojomc",2,Lousy beyond belief but I'll probably keep watching out of a morbid sense of curiosity. I guess THE AFTER qualifies as camp.
B00I3MMN4I,Marian Becker,5,Interesting and well done.  So happy that this apocalyptic story did not have any zombies. Looking forward to more episodes.  Thank you Amazon for entertainment that is worth watching.
B00I3MMN4I,Mark Burns,3,The story could be better written. I liked the actress who played the old women. The French actress is not very good. I would like to watch another episode to see if it gets better. It was not clear what happened when they were in the building.
B00I3MMN4I,Marlon,4,This show leaves you with so many questions. Enough to make me desire to watch a couple more episodes before deciding if i would complete a season. The genre has been done to death at this point but there's always room for one more if the writers can get the proceeding plot points right.
B00I3MMN4I,M. Boeder "La Fleur De la Vie",4,I disliked every single character but the mystery of what is happening around them is quite engaging.  After watching the pilot I want to see more.  This is a very scifi show and it reminds me a bit of World war Z and The walking dead without zombies.  I think it has a LOT of potential.  I would definitely watch more if it were available.
B00I3MMN4I,Meghan Jade,2,The After held my attention mostly because I was confused and had to see what was happening. It felt all over the place for me--and only one or two of the characters were actually bearable. I would be interested to continue watching if they work on the dialogue and make the story focus more on the actual reason it's all happening
B00I3MMN4I,Michael Cooper,4,I liked this made for TV series. It had a surprising ending that was obviously designed to pull you in for another viewing.
B00I3MMN4I,Michelle,4,I enjoyed this. When is the next episode coming on? I hope this show stays on. I'm tired of the networks schedules.
B00I3MMN4I,Miki Turtsanyi,4,The aliens bit was intriguing. I can't wait to see what happens to the characters. What will the tattoos mean?
B00I3MMN4I,Miya McKim,4,Totally grabbed me&#8230;thought it was going to be a nuclear aftermath&#8230;.you start to care about the characters&#8230;pretty stereotypical but campy too.  Made me jump&#8230;actually freaked me out a bit&#8230;I have to find out why having the same birthdate could send a bunch of survivors into the woods&#8230;love Sci Fi!
B00I3MMN4I,Mom of an ultimate frisbee geek,4,I like shows about how people will ban together when faced with conflict.Will be disappointing if the story doesn't follow through.
B00I3MMN4I,Moss,4,Like the idea of the show. Hope it will continue. A lot of possibilities with the script/plot. Crossing my fingers that the shows continues and the characters develop.
B00I3MMN4I,Mrfil7 "Swissman in D.C.",4,Love the concept of a unidentified threat. I feel like the plot is thought out and complex. The actors are fine actors who generally do a good job of conveying the fear and confusion. However I think the dialogue and personalities the writers gave them are weak. Many of their actions make no sense even for a panicked person. There is also too much filler dialogue...the usual &#34;are you ok?&#34; type. I just think the character personalities are a little confusing and could be polished and the dialogue could be expanded but a good overall shows with a convincing concept and cast that needs more pop and direction.
B00I3MMN4I,M. Whitehead,3,Started out with a very interesting plot but quickly got weird. If you liked lost you might like this. By the end of the episode your left with a sense that this series will end with everyone waking up from a dream.
B00I3MMN4I,Nannaneen,4,It kept my attention. I liked the characters almost immediately. The situations were believable. Wish they had a character that was obviously a &#34;prepper&#34; and could think more than 5 minutes ahead.
B00I3MMN4I,Nathaniel C. Konemann "indieN8",4,I love the storyline. The acting and dialogue seemed really bad at certain points. Some lines were delivered as if the actors were doing a cold read. I hope this gets better because this storyline and the mystery around the group of characters is too good.
B00I3MMN4I,Nika "LovesDharma",5,We love this show. It is action packed with an excellent plot. Please hurry up and release the next episode.
B00I3MMN4I,Nime,4,i love the cast and how the characters interact its really beautiful. while i am not a fan of disaster movies i'll say this one has potential as there is the whole post apocalyptic side that gives it a walking dead- Jericho feel but there is also the supernatural side that will unfold later which sort of reminds me of lost. i am a huge x files fan and even if this isn't sci-fi per se. i am quite optimistic. i really like the cast though i haven't warmed up to the French lady yet.
B00I3MMN4I,OJGreen317,4,Although had an amazing start at first I thought it would be more of a survival post apocalyptic show rather than sci-fi.
B00I3MMN4I,oldladywithbcs,5,LOVED it and plan to watch every episode.  Looking forward to show premier.  Can't wait to see who is going to make it.
B00I3MMN4I,Olethes A. Hodges,2,Lacking something...not a good start kind of confusing! I will not watch this again! Really do not have anything else to say!
B00I3MMN4I,Patti E. McClellan "Sister Patti",5,Somewhere between Lost and X-Files with a touch of Walking Dead.  This iis so going on my Watch List!  Highly recommended.
B00I3MMN4I,Paul Fischer,4,Great premise. Much action. Good acting. Want to see what happens in subsequent episodes. Lots of mysteries to solve  Bring on more.
B00I3MMN4I,Penny Abernathy,4,I'm a huge Aldis Hodge fan and would watch it for several episodes to see where the writers take it.
B00I3MMN4I,P. Shanahan "Fathead",4,Looking forward to the series. Chris Carter hasn't lost his touch. Fun post apocalyptic space invaders and the earthlings who battle them. Nice launch it remains to be seen if the series follow through on the promise. Nice twists and turns. Nice laying out of the challenges and mysteries. Some intriguing characters forming a good ensemble and a good old fashion alien invasion.  I'll make the popcorn while you make the series Mr. Carter.
B00I3MMN4I,raisinets38,3,Not sure if I would watch long it was just curiosity that made me watch.  I don't know if I will watch anymore
B00I3MMN4I,Rating My Best Pick,5,Amazon should pick this show up if they are deciding to do so. I think it's suspenseful and it high lights very good energy though  out the show. I love anything that has do with apocalypses survival as a unit and a story that is believable you can't go wrong with it. A good scare and a good thriller will make the show last a very long time.
B00I3MMN4I,Ray Macmeeken "Ray MacMeeken",3,This could be a good show and has an excellent cast.  But it leaves you with more question than Chris Carter usually has on his shows.  I want to like the show but you would have to kill of the irritating Irish guy that is just too much to stand with his using f... several times in each sentence it gets really old quickly.  I will watch if there are more episodes but it will have to answer some questions fast or I don't think anyone could stay with it.  It will have a shorter lifespan than The Event which was an excellent show.
B00I3MMN4I,ReaperMan,4,Interesting to the point that I wanted to watch to see what the hell it was that was happening. Then all of a sudden the lost a day somewhere.
B00I3MMN4I,robert robinson,3,The movie is okay. It started off weak by showing that the black man saying that he was innocence when it had appeared that he and his accomplish had broken into the police car plus he was carrying a assault weapon then he let loose his hostage. It could've started off a little better than that.How could the old lady maid get kidnap by those thugs if the power was down. How did they get pass the fench if the black guy had to ram the truck through it. Good luck.
B00I3MMN4I,R.P.,1,Even with the best effort of suspended disbelief this is profoundly difficult to watch. The chaotic street scenario is so preposterous as is the rest of this exercise in an implausible circumstance followed by plot-line buffoonery of the highest order attempting to be a  scifi / doomsday disaster of a pilot episode.
B00I3MMN4I,Sammie Kaie "Sammie",4,I liked it. I just hope it doesn't  go on and on like &#34;Lost&#34; did. I liked the storyline but think it would get dull after awhile. I would watch one season and hope it had an ending.
B00I3MMN4I,S. Collins,5,Ok I'm hooked i want to see more asap!!!!  I want to know what is going on!!! love it!!I really wish you would do the zombieland series but since I cant have that ...(which was by far the best pilot you have ever made hands down!!!) I want this one!!
B00I3MMN4I,Scott Dyer,4,I am always looking for a good science fiction show and this may be it.  The show ended with a lot more questions than answers which is often a good sign.
B00I3MMN4I,Scott E. Bruneau,5,Loved it... edge of the seat very good well done good interesting characters good writing very suspenseful. Make more... sign me up for more!
B00I3MMN4I,Scott,4,Pilot ended at a point leaving you wanting to know more about what is happening.  Very good so far though.
B00I3MMN4I,Scotty,3,The movies acting could use some work. The plot is biblical or sci-fi? Just a whole lot of running around in the first episode. Think it could turn into a good series depending on the way the plot develops but right now seems a little weak.
B00I3MMN4I,Sherrykay,5,I am looking forward to the rest of the series! SF/Fantasy/Dystopia-all great! When will the series be available? So much better than neo-adolescent comedies featuring slobby guys!
B00I3MMN4I,Sierra Banack,2,Things I love about the show:Characters from various backgroundsThat it seems to be going more toward the supernatural side rather than the zombie side of things. &#34;The After&#34; please don't make these things zombies. I'm so tired of zombies.I do like the suspense and how it plays out.Things I hate about the show:The F-word is said every other sentence for this show. I mean....I am not opposed the word. In any sense but when its not character appropriate it just doesn't make sense. I mean my favorite movie is Boondock saints and I thought that was tame compared to the amount of F-bombs they use in this show. Its appropriate for the irish and the convict character It really doesn't fit anyone else to say it. /endrantOther than that it looks like it has potential
B00I3MMN4I,Spider "spider",5,This show was suspenseful and great promise.Pilots are always scattered trying to hook you into wanting more....  This one succeeds!
B00I3MMN4I,Spike,2,The first 20 minutes you patiently wait and hope...the next 20 minutes you wonder why you are still watching it and the last 20 you are just laughing.  It's really really bad.  I mean...BAD.  Their is a character in the show that they call OLD LADY the whole show...never during the hours spent or even going to her house do they exchange names.  At the beginning they have an &#34;escape convict&#34; who's dialogue was him just reading his character bio sheet.  Sad Sad Sad Sad Sad
B00I3MMN4I,Stephan A. Miller,5,Very interesting. Whole different take on the apocalypse. Very intersting monsters. Looking for episode 2 as soon as it's available.
B00I3MMN4I,Steve Lilly,5,One show and I want to know what is going to happen. The premise is interesting and I have to know why March 7th!
B00I3MMN4I,Sweetpea,3,This is not usually my type of show but It had a pretty good start and held my interest.  It was hard to tell exactly where it was going in terms of what disaster would play out.  The ending was weird.  I would probably watch the next episode and see where it goes.  I could do with less profanity.
B00I3MMN4I,Sylvester Fields Jr.,3,I believe this is a series worth keeping. I am not much of a syfi buff but I would watch.
B00I3MMN4I,TD,4,The pilot was a very good start. I dont think I would have stuck around but it was nice to see the twist that the first episode put us though. The alien was a little over kill so I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. I will still continue to watch it in hopes that the series unfolds a little better.
B00I3MMN4I,Teamchaos,3,This show had me hooked until the very end.  ****Spoiler Alert****I liked the characters and the mystery that was developing.  We could have waited until the end of the first season to see the devil/alien/whatever.  The creepy character that shows up at the end of the episode seems to point the series in a strange direction.  I'm not sure that I would watch more than a few more episodes of the series if it goes in the direction it looks like it's going.
B00I3MMN4I,Terrie,4,Not sure about this one. I'd have to see a couple more episodes. The pilot has me curious but didn't grab me. I felt I was in between the Twilight Zone and Lost.
B00I3MMN4I,THE G,5,Very different show like The Event or FlashForward  but with more twists and turns.You just don't know what is going to happen next.
B00I3MMN4I,TheMaximusKane,5,The show is well written and well acted. The story is intriguing and addictive. A lot of questions that need to be answered and I would love to see how the story will progress.
B00I3MMN4I,Tim,4,Started out slow but built up.  By the time the show ended I know I had to have it on my watch list.  There is action through out the show but the hints of something unusual started to build.  It was at the end that realize it was going to be a great series.
B00I3MMN4I,T. Lamont,5,What can I say? I loved the (early) X-Files and I love Chris Carter's work.  I truly hope the powers that be fund this series.  I want more!  It was excellent!
B00I3MMN4I,Tony,2,It was just too childish to keep my attention.  It a series I will pass up. I can't see it being successful
B00I3MMN4I,Toti,5,I hope they make &#34;The After&#34; into a full series. The characters are well drawn-out and the story line is believable and well-written. It had me hooked from the beginning and the ending of Part I was great! The writers make you care about the characters and what happens to them. How will they survive what happened let alone each other? Hopefully a full season will be approved and we will learn more.
B00I3MMN4I,T. Weisman "Mongol Rising",5,At first i thought it was going to be a post-apocalyptic drama like Jericho but then the last five minutes changed my mind.
B00I3MMN4I,Vic Graninger,5,The pilot was great I wish Amazon would hurry up and release more in this series.
B00I3MMN4I,violet rose,5,I loved this show.........this one & bosch are tops are my fav's :) m  this show kept me wanting more.........u cant leave us hanging on amazon.............please add this season...........I enjoyed the story........kept me wondering which is what a sci fi suspense/mystery show is suppose to do...............enjoyed the characters...........I trust that chris carter will keep us loving this :)
B00I3MMN4I,Walter Orlandini,3,A catastrophic event shuts down all electrical power including communications. 7 people with the same birthday are thrown together and must find a way to cooperate to survive. Pilot ended with the discovery of an alien.
B00I3MMN4I,Winston C Cooke Jr,4,I love shows that start with some disaster and you don't know what it is. This pilot got really creepy at the end and I can't wait to see where this is going.
B00I3MMN4I,Youngatheart,5,Hitchcock would have been jealous. The writers sure know how to keep you dialed in. Ortiz is perfect. As is the rest of the talented cast. Couldn't ask for a better series.
B00I3MMN4I,ZZrider,3,Coming from Chris Carter I have high hopes for this one.  The pilot didn't hook me though due to the poor acting.  I'm not sure where this show is going and that's one reason I would like to see more.  A interesting and spooky end of the world thriller that has potential.
B00I3MMQYK,AJ,3,If this show were on TV I would watch the next couple of episodes to determine whether I would stick with it for an entire season.  It could be a fantastic show or a flop.  I personally watch the X-files and other supernatural type shows.  I like that the plot leaves you wondering what is next.  There are some details about the show that bug me. Maybe that is part of the plot. I don't know. I would watch a few more to see if there were further character development.
B00I3MMQYK,Amazon Customer "k9sage",1,This show is so bad I gave up half way through the pilot.  It is illogical and foolish. Don't waste your time and Amazon should not waste their money to make this disaster.
B00I3MMQYK,Amazonian,1,Not that good. Good acting and some big actors but all and all a weird show. Raised some interesting question in the pilot but don't think I would stick around to find them out.
B00I3MMQYK,Anne,1,I found the storyline boring. Every character has been done before & the combination of 8 different people thrown together is old.
B00I3MMQYK,B. J. LARKIN "The Beej",4,TOO MANY THINGS HAPPENING AT ONCE CHRIS CARTER!!!  Make the narrative clearer and you will have another hair raising thriller....I had to suspend my disbelief a LOT on this one - just on the HUMAN elements not counting the extra stuff at the end....so with some clearer vision I can see this being our &#34;did you see that?&#34; show of the year.  And I do love most of the cast - but some of stereotypical writing makes me wonder if you guys were just being misogynists or LAZY writers....curse words every few seconds does not a man a make.
B00I3MMQYK,Book Lover "Black Book Lover",5,Awesome !!! I final feel like the whole in my heart left from the ending of Lost can finally be filled
B00I3MMQYK,Brian "GlobaltechATLAS",5,I love Amazon pilot season.  Hope this gets picked up!A bit like the Walking Dead with demons.  Buckle up baby... it's gonna be a ride.
B00I3MMQYK,Brian Reisman,5,I simply have to see what happens next... That is the very definition of mus see television. Much better than anything else i've seen on Amazon originals to date.
B00I3MMQYK,chikiBABY,5,I'm hooked! I wish that Amazon Prime members had access to ALL the episodes! When it is FREE it should be FREE and NOT have to supply a PIN number.This series has a Stephen King feel to it minus(-)  the Stephen King corniness.I really need to see more of this!
B00I3MMQYK,Christophe A. German "Chris",1,I WANTED to like this show...until the &#34;black con&#34; started driveling about the &#34;black prison industrial complex.&#34; Can a few conservatives write a show for once?
B00I3MMQYK,ClearBucket,4,Not sure whats quite going on. Its kind of like Lost in the fact that it makes you want to watch more.
B00I3MMQYK,Cynthia M. Ferguson,4,I enjoyed the pilot; the characters were three dimensional. It left me with a lot of questions; if it was a series I would definitely watch it.
B00I3MMQYK,Danny L. Abernathy,5,a new mystery and an old theme/ demons and fallen angels that the BIBLE talks about are the only aliens out there.just because you do not believe the truth does not void it.
B00I3MMQYK,Dave,3,Alien zombies.  Give me a break.  While more may have gone into this pilot much less comes out.  I can live without it.
B00I3MMQYK,David K.,1,This show was sad. The acting was horrid. The dialogue sounded like it was written by a high school student. Plus the plot is tired. Aren't there already enough shows and movies out there about the apocalypse??? This was definitely one of the worst that I have seen. A complete waste of 54 minutes.
B00I3MMQYK,Denise Brown "Have a blessed day!",5,I hope this show is continued! I really enjoyed the pilot episode. I was left wanting MORE!!! It seems promising.
B00I3MMQYK,destiny 3,4,This could be a great series if it can maintain the excitement of the pilot. I want to see more!
B00I3MMQYK,Donald Matthews,5,I liiked the premise and the start of the series.  For the most part it was very interesting and made me want to see what happens.I hope this is picked up as a series but do worry it might be hard to make a interesting series for a complete season or even harder for more then one season.  It depends on which way the series goes but am willing to watch from what I have seen in the pilot.
B00I3MMQYK,Doug Henning,4,Carter sure crammed a lot of stuff in this pilot episode.  Is this another version of Walking Dead except with insect looking aliens instead of zombies?? Lots of questions like how they all have the same birthday???  What does March 7 mean???I have a feeling this might go to production mostly because of the pedigree of Carter.  I have certainly seen worse pilots that became shows..
B00I3MMQYK,Gerold Ransom "G Mon'e",5,Same B-Day now that is a good twist on the matter. I just wonder what will the rest be like.
B00I3MMQYK,Jason K. Roberts,5,This show has great potential and I really enjoyed the pilot. Hope to see more of this one in the future.
B00I3MMQYK,Jennifer D. Williams,5,This was a great show!  It held my attention and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I will definitely watch this show in the regular.
B00I3MMQYK,Jeremy Van Pelt,5,The creator of the X-Files is back with a great story that has an exciting ending to the first episode.Let's hope this one makes the cut. Don't miss it.
B00I3MMQYK,Joe,2,It sort of had me in stitches at parts due to the acting and the dialogue. It wasn't for me.
B00I3MMQYK,John R McGonagle,4,I'd definitely watch more but it hangs a bit on previously topics that have been on the walking dead. Leaves many cliffhangers to keep you wanting more but too many in my opinion.
B00I3MMQYK,Jolene Ebe,5,I loved this pilot it had the post apocalyptic theme which I have been watching for a while now. I liked how it kept your attention throughout the show and kept the momentum from beginning to end which in most shows they lose interest quickly. I am hoping this is a series that Amazon picks up because the ending alone makes you want to watch more of the series to figure out what happened and what is going on now.The show itself reminds me of The Walking Dead in its premise but almost takes on a biblical standpoint with the actors talking about the book of revelations without being super religious at all. It makes you wonder if they are going to be going towards following the book of Revelations or going more of the Walking Dead route as the series goes on. Either way I am hoping this becomes a series so that we can continue watching it because without it I am going to be forever wondering about the ending.
B00I3MMQYK,Joshua Glowzinski "Gman",5,This is the first prime show I've watched.  I really liked it.  It had good acting.  A bit of corniness and a story that makes me want to see more.  I have to find out the mystery behind all the stuff that is happening.  I hope they continue this show.  Very cool.
B00I3MMQYK,Kasia,5,The Pilot made me want to see more for sure !!! don't want to go in details to make any spoilersbut worth watching for sure ..First I was thinking .. Revolutionthen Walking Deadthen Terrorist attackthen only one was left .. and I guessed rightbut you have to see it for yourself .. :)Amazon ... I would like to see more !!! please!!
B00I3MMQYK,Len Brown,5,Rivals and surpasses the networks attempts in this genre.  Well cast with a dynamite cliffhanger.  Bring on the 2nd episode quickly.  I AM HOOKED!  Bravo for &#34;The After&#34;.
B00I3MMQYK,Looking for a Blockbuster,5,Kinda like Fringe or X Files. A Really good show that builds your anticipation. Cant wait to find out what invaded the earth and  why this group is connected.  Lets keep it going.
B00I3MMQYK,MarquisMark,5,This is not normally in my wheelhouse. I didn't watch Lost or Revolution. I did watch X-Files. Chris Carter knows how to hook me in.Order the series already!
B00I3MMQYK,me,1,A little too late...Chris Carter really went out on a limb with this one...all the characters were cliched and very unbecoming. The female French protagonist was so annoying while the Irish/Scot character was typical and flat.This is horrible...hope &#34;The After&#34; becomes &#34;The Never&#34;.
B00I3MMQYK,Mootsie,5,I watched X-Files and loved it.  Until the end.  Kinda dropped the ball on the back story. The individual stories were much more interesting and fun to watch. But this show The After definitely has that Chris Carter feel to it.  I just hope he doesn't layer the mysteries so deep that in the end you get too much dumped on you because the writer(s) ran out of time with the series.  So far so good. Very entertaining. Please continue the series.  I can't wait to see more.  And for those of you who are so offended by the language and the ADULT content...watch Animal Planet or Disney Channel.
B00I3MMQYK,NHShopper,3,The pilot is well done but I'm not a fan of this genre. Do we really need another show about the chaos at the end of civilization?  Invest your energy in something more positive for humanity.
B00I3MMQYK,N. Nichols "Nicole",4,This is a typical end of world series.  I enjoyed it and it had bits of suspense throughout.  I would watch it if it was a series as long as they didn't go too far out with too much imagination.  I wasn't too thrilled with the alien.
B00I3MMQYK,Richard Siegmeister,2,I was looking forward to wathing this pilot becaus it was by Christ Carter but the pilot was awful.  I would not watch another episode.
B00I3MMQYK,Sentinus,4,Smart and suspenseful sci-fi. Good cast and believable portrayal of their characters. In the same vein as Lost and Fringe. Deserving of a shot by Amazon production in my opinion.
B00I3MMQYK,swims2me,5,This show promises to be Chris Carter's best. I loved the &#34;X Files&#34; and &#34;Millenium&#34; was good. This show combines these shows together. I can't wait!
B00I3MMQYK,T. Briggs,5,....but what I can say is that it had me intrigued the whole way and the last scene was interesting enough to make me want to watch this.Did the owl have red eyes too?
B00I3MMQYK,Tim Johnson,2,disappointing - characters are silly and their reactions are even worse - opening scene of chaos was badly directed. i like this kind of film but it is no Invasion LA
B00I3MMQYK,Varun,4,This one has a lot of ideas borrowed from other programs. But it seems to be a good story and filled with a lot of suspense and paranormal things. Looking forward to a full fledged season.
B00I3MMQYK,Vulcanicus,3,I liked the characters they carried me through until the final surprising conclusion revealing that the apocalypse what's the transition apparently into an alternate universe.. Clearly any future episodes will be run by a whole set of different rules considering the abilities of the creature that they show. Which may indicate that the the characters will have to learn new ways to deal with these creatures. I'm guessing you're assuming the creature will probably join them and teach them about what's going on with the transition.in any case out of the 5 that have been presented so far I like this one the best!
B00I3MMQYK,William Spencer,1,I didn't care for the story line or the character dynamics. I feel that story had to much going on. I wouldn't watch the show if more episodes were made.
B00I3MMQYK,W. Mcmanus,4,I would watch it if this was ordered for a full season but I would consider some different actors. Just a little rough in a couple of spots especially with the lady playing the lead.
B00I3MMQYK,Zombie Enthusiast 1976,5,Let's see what's next!  Good cast/acting and story line.  When is the next episode?  Where do we find out if this is going to continue?
B00I3MMTS8,Amazon Customer,2,I enjoyed parts of this. I think the actors did a good job. I just don't really see this as going somewhere. It leaves a lot to be desired.
B00I3MMTS8,Amazon Customer,5,I thought the pilot episode was very good and I'm curious to see how it's going to go. More episodes please?
B00I3MMTS8,Amazon Customer,1,I like Jeffrey Tambor and many of the other actors but the story was interesting.  Too many distractions and no point.
B00I3MMTS8,Amazon Customer "no relation 2 sylvia",2,This material might have made for a better movie than a tv series. Can't imagine this sustaining over the long haul.
B00I3MMTS8,Amazonian,1,Stupid show. Not funny and weird. Do not even want to talk about it anymore but I want my vote to count.
B00I3MMTS8,A. Robinson "hotarobin",1,To each his/her own.I have absolutely no interest in following this series whatsoever.  It is listed under the genre of comedy but the humor is very dry to me.
B00I3MMTS8,A Sawyer,5,Loved this pilot episode. The watched six feet under and loved that show so I was pumped about this show. The storyline is one that I haven't seen before and is great! I will definitely watch this show again if it makes it.
B00I3MMTS8,Barb in Savannah,4,I am looking forward to MORE episodes.  The characters are quirky with a different family chemistry.  I would like to see how the family explains their relationships.
B00I3MMTS8,Birdeee,1,I did not care for it. A few minutes was all I needed to judge this show. Not worth my time.
B00I3MMTS8,Brenda Walls,2,Was okay not the worst thing on TV..can see how it could be funny but other wise I was waiting for it to be over.
B00I3MMTS8,Brian T. Marino "Brian",5,This is some excellent pitch black dark comedy here with an outstanding cast. Very refreshing to see a show like this. Jill Soloway is a brilliant writer. Hope to see more!
B00I3MMTS8,Brick,5,My Favorite of the 5 Pilots all of which I watched today. I thoroughly enjoyed the actors and the characters. So it may not be groundbreaking but what is anymore. I want to find out where this goes and I can't imagine not enjoying the ride.
B00I3MMTS8,Chele "Loves drama",3,After I finished watching I just sat  here not sure if I liked it or not.  It did not move me one way or the other.  The title gave away what Jeffrey Tambor's character wanted to discuss with his kids.  I don't think I liked any of his kids. Maybe I wasn't suppose to???If this is picked up (but not the only show selected) I will give it another try.
B00I3MMTS8,chinagirl "ncchinagirl",2,I tried to give this show a shot but none of these characters had any redeemable qualities whatsoever. They were quite pathetic actually.
B00I3MMTS8,ClearBucket,4,This started started low and weak but ended very interesting. The second episode will have a lot to tell with an ending like that.
B00I3MMTS8,Daniel Clausen,4,I like the fact that some of what happened really took me by surprise that usually doesn't happen with TV shows any more.
B00I3MMTS8,DarylJr,2,Just not that interesting.  Too many depressing story lines.  I usually Jeffery Tambor but this was not his best work.  The is worst of the &#34;pilots&#34; I have seen so far.
B00I3MMTS8,DeeGee "Dee",4,It took me a minute to warm up to this show but about 10 minutes into it I was hooked.  This family interested me and made me want to know more.  Excellent cast and some sly funny humor are pluses.  Jeffrey Tambor always gives anything he works in that slight little &#34;twist&#34;.  I would watch this series
B00I3MMTS8,destiny 3,2,I liked the Tambor character but didn't like anyone else on the show. This would probably not be a show I would watch on a regular basis because the adult children just didn't interest me. Jeffrey Tambor does his usual good job. As much as I like him I would still have a hard time wanting to see a second episode.
B00I3MMTS8,Diane,1,What has happened? This was horrible -  This was offensive and I'm tired of unnecessary nude and sex scenes that have nothing to do with the storyline.  Urgggg
B00I3MMTS8,Diane R.,1,the show takes forever to get anywhere and when something in the plot actually happens it is not that great
B00I3MMTS8,Diego Ramirez,1,Another show about how hard is to be white upper middle class in America. Is it about millennials? about old hippies? bisexuals? Not sure I can tell.
B00I3MMTS8,Donald Matthews,1,I watched the pilot but I wouldn't want to see anymore.  It did have good acting and some different characters but just wasn't my type of show.  It wasn't funny and even as a dark comedy it just didn't interest me at all.  The characters were some of the most boring I have seen and don't care about any of them.  Terrible show!!!!!!
B00I3MMTS8,Doug Henning,5,It's got all the bases covered in this family.  Great actors and interesting premise that would make a terrific show.
B00I3MMTS8,D. Robertson,2,I have never been into this kind of show.  I found myself doing other things about 5 minutes into the show.  It is the only one of the pilots that i would not watch if it is made
B00I3MMTS8,Dr. W. C. Wiseley "words-music-images",1,It is just to far over the top for me. Everyone has gender issues. Not that realistic even though some of these issues must occur.
B00I3MMTS8,Dusguicheon "Baer",4,Even though the characters of the grown children aren't very likeable I found the show and it's premise to be thought provoking and interesting.  I would definitely watch if this is made into a series
B00I3MMTS8,E. Bailey,5,(spoiler) I was riveted watching him as a woman. Amazing acting. Interesting and new characters. Wonderful. Catch wait to watch the next one.
B00I3MMTS8,Frances I. Tucker "babybee",3,Somewhat clich&eacute;d;  usual Hollywood family stereotypes.  No one seems to be actually working a regular job.  Some funny bits here and there.  Tambor brings his talent for understated funniness and pathos to his character.
B00I3MMTS8,Gerald Weis,1,Great idea to try bringing a very real subject to the screen.  However my house can not watch it because of all the nudity and the language.  If this is the type smut someone wants to watch then they should just subscribe to HBO.  Shame on Amazon on taking a subject like this and turning it into such a filthy environment that it can not be watched in mixed company with teenagers.  Or shame on anyone who thinks this show is appropriate for their family and their teenagers.  Clean it up Amazon and then perhaps it would be ok.
B00I3MMTS8,Humberto Gonzalez "humbe",3,Indi film feel with good acting and script for what seems to be a well laid foundation for promising following episodes.  It had a slow start though and I almost closed it and didn't finish watching it.  I would watch at least 2 more episodes to see if it could hook me.
B00I3MMTS8,Janette M. Guyre,1,there is too much sex in the 1st show and not enough character development . It was easy to figure out what the father's was hiding and easy to know the 2 girl lovers from college would get together and I have no idea about the brother and the younger sister don't want to watch it again
B00I3MMTS8,J. Hedgepeth,5,This show has the perfect blend of drama and comedy.The acting is spectacular.The presentation is great.The story is awesome.This show deserves to get picked up.
B00I3MMTS8,Jill Taylor,1,Yuck!  This simply panders to what the writers think is fashionably LA perverse.  If it is by the creator of Six Feet Under then what happened?  That was a great show.  These characters have too much time on their hands. Pathetic!
B00I3MMTS8,J. L. Schram "Shoe Critic",2,There are too many taboos being broken in 30 minutes to have time to bond to the people so it's just dirty fluff.
B00I3MMTS8,J. Miles,4,It's definitley another show about a dysfunctional family but I think was done very well.  Each sibiling has a good story line and the Dad's story is a twist that I never would have expected.
B00I3MMTS8,J. Neuman,5,this show was great. I enjoyed the different nature of it and the characters are all perfect.  Looks like it will be very good.
B00I3MMTS8,Joe,5,Great actors gave brand new characters depth in just 30 minutes. Would love to see this picked up as a series.
B00I3MMTS8,John N,3,Did not connect with characters very much.  The dad saying his kids were selfish and self-involved ignoring his cross-dressing.You think?
B00I3MMTS8,Jolene Ebe,2,I didn't think the show was funny at all. I couldn't get into the plot of the show either there was nothing captivating or that peaked my interest at all. I like the fact that they were trying to bring transgender into the spotlight a bit more but the show seemed dull at best.
B00I3MMTS8,Joshua Glowzinski "Gman",5,I had no clue what to expect from this show.  It really was odd.  It did not feel like I was watching a show.  It felt like I was watching a video of a family.  Very slow pace.  Not much filler.  Just the facts.  You got a glimpse of this family.  I would love to see more of this show.
B00I3MMTS8,Judith A. Smith,4,We found all the different personalities of the family interesting and enjoyed the various stories. We would continue to watch it so please do more episodes.
B00I3MMTS8,Judith Church,5,I like the story which follow a familiar plot line and could go in interesting directions. It's nice not to be able to predict where it's going.
B00I3MMTS8,Katherine Holmes,5,It was well written and very interesting. I liked it a lot and would recommend it.  The ending was a surprise.
B00I3MMTS8,Kindle Customer,5,What a knock-out.  Unpredictable story-lines and completely original characters.  I'm very interested in seeing how these characters develop and work through their inner conflicts.
B00I3MMTS8,Kindle Customer,1,What a waste of good talented actors.  Story line was so weak the we didn't even make it through half the show. Totally bored out of my mind.
B00I3MMTS8,K. Moore "daxem",4,The show feels like a twisted and more downtrodden version of Parenthood. I liked it and would be willing to watch more.
B00I3MMTS8,L. Browning,1,This is a terrible show & I hope it doesn't see the light of day.  I think your exploration of sexuality is a big bust.  Trash this one immediately.
B00I3MMTS8,Leslie J McGrath,2,People with problems and not enough charm to keep me interested in how it would all turn out. I'll give it a pass.
B00I3MMTS8,Lester Eversen,1,Characters that grate and dialogue that annoys rather than entertains. Is this a comedy because a man in a dress is supposed to be funny (it's not)? Let's hope this one doesn't make it past the pilot.
B00I3MMTS8,LFP,3,Debated between 3 and 4 stars. This could be quite good if they don't try too hard to be edgy at the expense of being genuinely funny.
B00I3MMTS8,Lorie A Stevens "LAS",5,The writing and cast are amazing.  Of the 5 new Amazon pilots this one is my favourite.  Listen to the reviewers who enjoyed this show.  Watch it and put a smile on your face.
B00I3MMTS8,louis "unapologetic fan of good tv",5,what it would look like if the &#34;royal tennenbaums&#34; and &#34;six feet under&#34; had a drunken moment and begat a bastard show. and i mean that in the best possible way. i hope this one continues.
B00I3MMTS8,LOVE ROMANCE "ITHADTOBEYOU",1,I dud not like this movue st all.  I would not recommend it to anyone.I did nit enjoy the story.  Would not support the story line at all.
B00I3MMTS8,Magpie,4,With only a pilot to judge by I would say Transparent is funny but needs a bit more than the dad's character to keep me coming back for me...hope it develops into a good one...but not convinced yet.
B00I3MMTS8,Marc Campbell "mojomc",5,Superb on every level. This is a keeper. &#34;Transparent&#34; reminds me of Robert Altman's films and I love Altman. I want more.
B00I3MMTS8,Marci,5,We loved Jeffrey Tambor as the main character. Loved figuring out his secret and the ending of the pilot show. Can't wait to see more.
B00I3MMTS8,Marian Becker,5,It's wonderful that there is finally some shows worth watching.  Thank you Amazon! All the new shows are great. Looking forward to the next episode
B00I3MMTS8,M. Boeder "La Fleur De la Vie",2,I think this is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't find it funny at all. :( :( :(
B00I3MMTS8,me,3,Jeffrey Tambor would be the only reason  I would keep on watching this series. There is a simple innocence this man portrays which I find intriguing. Overall the cast of characters seem to be complex enough to create the chaos that every American family has yet it doesn't compel me to keep on watching for any other reason than Jeffrey.
B00I3MMTS8,Moss,1,Extremely boring and weird. It tries to hard to be unique and different without having any substance. In end I did not care for the show.
B00I3MMTS8,Nancy J.,3,One must keep in mind this is rated MA. I'm not a fan of watching this type of ratings show but likes Jeffrey.
B00I3MMTS8,Nathaniel C. Konemann "indieN8",5,Love the dark comedy. Love the music. Love the awkward scenarios and storyline. I am definitely onboard to watch more.
B00I3MMTS8,Ned "Porschephile",1,Watching this once was once more than I should have.  Is this the way people live in California?  No way I would watch any more of this.  Wish some of the stuff that was Transparent would have been more opaque
B00I3MMTS8,Nikki,3,I love the dynamics of this family. Each of them thinks they're the only one harboring a secret. It's definitely a look into how complicated family relationships can be.
B00I3MMTS8,Nime,5,this is the odd sort of comedy you are likely to find on HBO. well acted and realistic its so Girls meets parenthood. i like it i really really like it. the family's interaction is so believable you know plus they look like they could be actual siblings. i want more.
B00I3MMTS8,number one reader,1,I turned it off twenty minutes into it. I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. And within twenty minutes it has to at least catch my attention and this on sadly did not. I don't even want to give it one star but I am sure that it will make me choose before I can actually post my review. Yep...right down there on the bottom of the review it says Star rating required. I want to give it a half a star then and only because I have to.
B00I3MMTS8,nurse_judith,5,Ohhh Yeah!  This is a great beginning to a great series.  The actors are superb and the storyline is funny but then dramatic....full of twists and turns.  This is going to be a series you won't want to miss.
B00I3MMTS8,OJGreen317,5,Anyone who has seen Six Feet Under knows that the creator of this show is no joke not to mention the HBO/Showtime actors that are in it as well.
B00I3MMTS8,Paul Fischer,5,This was by far this best of the new round of pilots. Best group of actors and very funny and humane. Looking forward to more episodes.
B00I3MMTS8,Ponytail Pam,1,Didn't care for the show at all. It 's not uplifting and doesn't leave you wanting to see more. I was glad when it was over.
B00I3MMTS8,Rburch,1,This may be a good show for an audience other than me. I just do not enjoy these multiple character personality interaction shows about family members.
B00I3MMTS8,reader,4,Another promising show from Amazon. Make it into a series? yes there is enough to occupy interest for a good few weeks as well as the inevitable acres of flexh on display.
B00I3MMTS8,Richard Siegmeister,5,I felt like I was watching a great indie film or a cool HBO series.  A superb cast and wonderful acting.  I want to know more about each one of these characters. I hope it is not long until we see episode 2.
B00I3MMTS8,Robert Habeski,1,I did not like it at all.  The characters are shallow and ridiculous. The situations that each one of them have to deal with are convoluted and artificial.  I find it depressing.
B00I3MMTS8,robert robinson,3,The movie is okay but it can use some work. It has more 'lows' than 'highs' and the lack-lustful sex scences don't do much to pick it up. It has no excitement but there's room for it. Get some sexual or some type of movtivation conflict drafted into it some how to cause some type of tension that will bring or almost bring the house down. The movie has enough of variable scences to make it possible. Good luck.
B00I3MMTS8,Saint Louis "Chick",4,Quirky and yet surprisingly likable folk populate this pilot.  I would like to see the characters again because I suspect I'm in for some surprises.
B00I3MMTS8,Scott Dyer,3,I liked the show enough to watch another episode before deciding if it will make into my list of watched shows.  The first show was busy introducing the characters and did not really have time to grab my attention.
B00I3MMTS8,Sierra Banack,1,I waited for 25 minutes for something to happen. Its like this show is trying to be edgy or trendy or appeal to &#34;hipster&#34; crowd. DO NOT....DO NOT make this show into a reality.
B00I3MMTS8,Steve Lilly,4,The show had a steady verging on the slow pace allowing the chatacters to develop within the story. It felt very HBOish in a good way and I would watch more.
B00I3MMTS8,steven,5,Started out with a few false notes here and there but the main character is phenomenal. Great plot idea! Would definitely watch more. Hope this turns into a series.
B00I3MMTS8,Sue Boyle "blue9244",3,I thought I had already reviewed this pilot.  I liked it and was pretty cute for what it is - a dysfunctional family comedy.
B00I3MMTS8,Sylvester Fields Jr.,2,If this is a comedy it needs a lot of work. Before keeping this I would invest that money into alpha house.
B00I3MMTS8,Wilbur Sachs "Wilbur",4,From the pilot it's hard to know whether the series would continue as a out-of-the box program or take a turn towards the weird. But I enjoyed the first program and would definitely watch more.
B00I3MMTS8,Youngatheart,1,Convoluted plotline of a dysfunctional family that takes it one step further.Into intimacy with gays. Very warm and fuzzy. Just a great show for children. Gives them something to strive for. Please put the show back in the closet where only night vision glasses would help.
B00I3MN74S,Amazon Customer,3,It was cute. Nothing spectacular. I think kids would like it at least for a little while but I can't see it staying around.
B00I3MN74S,Amazon Customer "kevinap",3,Cute show for all ages. The Lead character seems poorly casted as he doesn't seem to convey any on-screen charm.
B00I3MN74S,Badassbubbaj,1,This show was definitely not meant for adults but even kids shows should have some interesting points.  The characters even seemed to be uninterested to be in this show.  Wish I didn't waste my time watching it!
B00I3MN74S,Dave,3,Good character but plot and writing (not that I am an expert by no means) not as interesting as other new potential series.
B00I3MN74S,D. Brennan,5,The story telling in this show is superb. The juxtaposition elegant yet almost child-like animation with the standard cinematography you find in well produced shows was refreshing. The children are at once clearly being normal kids yet possessed of a sense of adventure and wit far beyond their years. This was my favorite amazon demo I have seen this season.
B00I3MN74S,Diane,4,Great show for kids!  I wouldn't watch it on a regular basis but think young kids would really enjoy this!  Funny and cute!
B00I3MN74S,Grumpy Guy,4,We watched this as a family and both adults and kids were entertained.  Great casting and good to see that the editing style allowed for real character developement.
B00I3MN74S,Jeffrey A. Pinard,5,This is the best show of everything Aamzon is offering and I sincerely hope it gets picked up.  Our entire family will be watching every episode.
B00I3MN74S,jraff,5,much better than we thought it would be and definitely better than most kid tv out there. we're waiting for more!!
B00I3MN74S,mork1966,3,It is kind of simplistic. The plot idea is good though. I would watch more of this if developed. Put some polish on it and it could be as good as anything on Nick.
B00I3MN74S,murthom1,5,This show is engaging from the start. It feels a bit like Fairy Tale meets Leave it to Beaver. This is probably why the storyline seems to capture the attention of today's tween and their grandparents. It will be a hit.
B00I3MN74S,number one reader,5,This should be a great kids show for all ages. I can't imagine where they will go with this show but I did like the frog/boy story. It was cute.
B00I3MN74S,Pen Name,4,I thought this was a cute show.  I was surprised by how much I liked it. I think it is a show for the family to enjoy together.
B00I3MN74S,QueenOPearls "QueenOPearls",4,I'm a romantic... so I wish the ending were different.  Maybe.. just maybe.. if I wish... Amazon will create another episode.... people who didn't come back would... no spoiler... I'm just saying..Very enjoyable pre-teen movie.
B00I3MN74S,Richard Siegmeister,4,This reminded of shows like Pete & Peter or Clarissa.  I could see me watching this with my son and us both enjoying it.  The cast was great.  I hope they make more
B00I3MN74S,robert robinson,3,I liked the show because of the respect that the kids showed in helping their elders but some blanks needs to be filled in. When the young man gave her that ring it's true that she never promise herself to him but if you're going to show him in that light (a lier) it should have happen way before she saw him again in the club. Othewise she had no reason to say that he had cursed her life. He has no reason to be haunting her. Good luck.
B00I3MN74S,shop mom,5,My really picky 9 year old did enjoy the show and would like to see more. It's so very nice for the whole family to be able to sit down and watch a show together. Enjoyed how the story had some suspense.
B00I3MN74S,S. Ranson "Early Adopter",4,This was well-written and well-timed with a hint of the fantastical without dumbing it down for the younger audience. I hope that this show continues to develop and share more about what's happens on Normal Street.
B00I3MN74S,TheMaximusKane,1,I tried to give this pilot a chance just like I did with a few of the others and this one did something that the others did not...bored me from the beginning.  The show &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;The Rebels&#34; caught my attention from the very beginning while &#34;Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street&#34; lost me immediately.  The writing wasn't as great as the other shows and while Fionnula Flanagan is quaint as Miss Hudspith and Robyn Lively is more beautiful than ever the rest of the show has its flaws.  The children in the show don't have the ability to deliver the so called &#34;punchlines&#34; and there is just no chemistry.
B00I3MN74S,Toti,5,This is a great show you can watch with your kids. Not loud and silly like a lot of other kid's shows. Very real and brought back lots of memories of my own childhood.
B00I3MN74S,W. Mcmanus,4,I thought this was pretty good. Going to have my son watch it and see what he thinks about it.
B00I3MN9JG,Brandonia,5,I hope this turns into a full series. This to me is better than any other kids TV show out right now
B00I3MN9JG,Jaxim,1,I didn't like that so many stereotypes were used. The smart boys were inept socially while the main girl character does not have a high IQ but does have a high EQ (Emotional IQ). This is playing too much to stereotypes. I also didn't care for some the language: i.e. &#34;brain fart&#34; and &#34;wedgies&#34;. I'm glad I watched this before considering showing it to my daughter and son. Needless to say my children will not be watching this show.
B00I3MN9JG,melvin watkins,3,my daughter did not find this show worth watching a second time so we didn't that's all folks no no
B00I3MN9JG,robert robinson,4,I liked the show but the kids knew how to stop the Queen Bee to fast. They should've failed at least once.
B00I3MN9JG,Seb311,5,I thought it was good too. Reminded me of Phineus and Ferb. We will watch more episodes for sure. Hopefully it gets picked up by amazon.
B00I3MN9JG,Toti,4,This show has beautifully illustrated characters and an engaging storyline that will keep kid's attention. It teaches them how to navigate around different experiences and other kids at school and how to use their imaginations.
B00I3MNERI,Moss,5,Our son liked it TOO much. He was very upset that there wasn't another to watch when he was done watching the Pilot. He literally cried for a half hour in protest. Please make more of these shows.
B00I3MNERI,Richard Siegmeister,5,A very cute show.  It reminded me of the Wonder Pets which makes sense since it is by the created of that show.  My 3 year old loved it and shouted &#34;AGAIN&#34; at the end
B00I3MNERI,robert robinson,3,I liked the picture art. G. Raff started off by being disrespectful for leaving his friend alone on stage and to talk about making compomises after the fact is distasteful.
B00I3MNGCG,AJ,2,It was not the worse of the lot. It was slightly amusing for a short time. It was almost too predictable. The plot needs work and the Kenny G young gun conductor bugged me to no end.  This show did not make me laugh.  I would not foresee myself watching many episodes of this.  The young oboe student seemed to be the most compelling character of the bunch.  I really don't want to see a poor rendition of Sex and the City.
B00I3MNGCG,Amazon Customer,5,I've seen a lot of pilots over the years but this one is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Most suffer from the forced &#34;get to know your characters&#34; set up but this one seamlessly integrates the character development into the flow of the show.  I really hope this one gets picked up by Amazon because I would love to watch more.
B00I3MNGCG,Amazon Customer "kevinap",4,You can definitely feel for the romance and passion for music and life in this laid back romantic drama. This is a very polished pilot and has all the makings of having some longevity if it gets greenlighted.
B00I3MNGCG,Amazonian,4,Not your typical TV plot line but interesting. Has potential although not sure where they can go in the long time.
B00I3MNGCG,artist in residence "artist in residence",4,Okay I thought the show was good with a great story line just can't see how it can go long term.  Maybe one of those shows that is planned and planned for just a couple of seasons.
B00I3MNGCG,bc,4,Liked what I saw good show with a few different stories going.  I like the cast and would be interested in watching more
B00I3MNGCG,beekeeper "and stings to prove it",4,Good program. Interesting angle here. I was really getting into the characters and the program and wham! It was over! I really wanted that next episode to see what happens.
B00I3MNGCG,BudDel "Bud",1,Watched only a few minutes of this pilot and didn't like any of what I saw. OK if you're into a lot of classical music I guess.
B00I3MNGCG,Chele "Loves drama",4,I almost did not watch this one but am glad I did. Moved quickly although I thought the party competition scene slowed it down too much.  Would watch more episodes.
B00I3MNGCG,Claire Bear "You don't say...",5,Please pick this up! It's an unusual and intriguing premise that I am eager to see more of. Thoroughly enjoyed.
B00I3MNGCG,Codie Schlotterbeck,5,This pilot was awesome! I am dying for more!! Please continue with this series. It seems like a sure fire win!
B00I3MNGCG,Cole Parker,5,In a few simple words... I loved it. It was fresh and entertaining. My only critique is that 30 minutes seems a little short for a seemingly deep story driven show. Print it... and make more I say.
B00I3MNGCG,Cynthia M. Ferguson,4,It's interesting to see something about classical musicians; I enjoyed watching the pilot. Would definitely watch the series; it would be different than the normal fare on television.
B00I3MNGCG,David E. Holtzinger,5,I was hooked with Malcolm McDowell. Then I saw the rest of this pilot. Great production values. Such potential for intrigue. Reminds me of Smash but a lot better. Based on this pilot Amazon has a hit with the quality to rival Netflix's House of Cards. BRAVO!
B00I3MNGCG,david schlapman,3,never seen a show based around symphonies and classical music before. It may catch on. Be interewsted to see how the story line devolpes.
B00I3MNGCG,DeeGee "Dee",5,I loved this pilot.  It shows me a world that I have always been curious about and makes it extremely interesting.  This is something that I havent seen before.  As I was settling into it like a comfortable pillow it was over!!!  I wanted more--immediatley!  I would definitely watch episodes of this series.
B00I3MNGCG,Diane,3,Love the story line - could be interesting depending on writers.  Best of the 3 pilots I've watched so far.  Disappointing compared to "The Guardian"- bring back this series!
B00I3MNGCG,Diane R.,3,not really as good as the other pilot programs it probably wont be made so don't get invested in it
B00I3MNGCG,Dlpearman,5,Terrific acting by all involved. Secondary story lines are as interesting as the primary.This is my top pick of all the pilots .As soon as it ended I wanted more.
B00I3MNGCG,Donald Matthews,1,I watched about half the show and couldn't finish watching.  It had some good actors but it just wasn't very interesting.
B00I3MNGCG,Donna "Dreamseeker",4,This could be the best of the new pilots. Never been done before that I can remember. Characters could develop and be interesting. So this one is a win I think.
B00I3MNGCG,Doug Henning,3,I found it to be OK but maybe because I've seen other young people in NY shows.  I guess it sure is different and that might make it on a streaming platform like Amazon.  It's also a show that can be done cleaner I suppose with no need for nudity or curse words..  I would say that it would be an interesting choice if selected.
B00I3MNGCG,D. P. Lance,2,Just a Soap opera set in a Sym Orch. All character are stock and trade types and tell me waws B Peters high or asleep?
B00I3MNGCG,Ex Brit "smj",5,Great program and the storyline is very interesting.The whole cast were great.I hope this gets made into a series.
B00I3MNGCG,Forrest Whittaker,4,Interesting premise for a story line. Great casting and good pace to the show. Keep the good episodes coming our way.
B00I3MNGCG,Frances I. Tucker "babybee",5,Terrific casting;  loved Bernal as smug and talented (and knowing it).  Young musicians who actually work hard at a craft and not just playing with apps hoping to make their mark on the cultural scene.  Taking &#34;Flashdance&#34; a notch higher.  Wonderful watching millennials with aspirations beyond their looks.
B00I3MNGCG,Gerald Weis,2,I was hoping this show would be somewhat like Nashville only younger and into the classical world.  But again.  Can't watch it with family because there is so much filthy language and stupidity going on.  You want to watch a show that is enjoyable and that the whole family can sit and watch together.  Could you imagine asking grandma to sit and watch this with you?  Come on Amazon...  You can do better.
B00I3MNGCG,Gregg Davis,4,This looked like a pretty interesting show. The characters were good and it had an interesting storyline. I would watch it again.
B00I3MNGCG,Harry Roedersheimer,4,This one is full of faces you know.  Of course it has to be about the change over of a conductor.  But there is a bit of intrigue in the story line.  Liked seeing the young oboe player hustling to make a living.  Though the male dance clich&eacute; breaker seemed a bit off.And how often do all of these people live with each other in group settings when they are already making it?
B00I3MNGCG,Hrothgar,5,I have to be admit the show reminded me of college days and behaviors in the 60's among the theater and music students; behaviors which carried over into the real world of competitions and auditions where everyone was hungry to prove themselves and get a position with a professional company. Although this is a comedy there is some life imitating art here. A very good cast overall and a premise that has been explored before but not with as much intensity.
B00I3MNGCG,Humberto Gonzalez "humbe",1,Sorry but I've watched all 5 of the Amazon pilots and this one not only put me to sleep but I just couldn't even finish watching it.
B00I3MNGCG,Jacqueline A. Boyce "jack4102",5,I THINK THIS PROGRAM WOLD BE GOOD.  MUSICIANS ARE FULL OF PASSION AND WE SELDOM SEE THINGS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW.  IT HAS TO BE HARD TO COMPETE AND STAY ON TOP OF YOUR GAME.  I THINK THIS COULD MAKE FOR SOME INTERESTING VIEWING.
B00I3MNGCG,Jake A.D.,5,I certainly hope Amazon picks up this original gem for full production.  Great cast and a great subject that isn't the typical dr./cop/lawyer shows that dominate drama on networkd tv.  I already feel invested in the characters after one show.
B00I3MNGCG,Janet L. Jackson "California Girl",4,I haven't read the book from which this is based but I can't want to see another episode. The only thing remotely similar that I can recall like this would be Fosse's All That Jazz with all the behind the scenes shenanigans of the polished-pristine-front. I like the newbie and the old trooper conversation and there is definitely room to stretch and get much much better.
B00I3MNGCG,Janette M. Guyre,4,I enjoy any show that takes place in New York. I am interested to see where the story goes and hope it does not get caught in run of the mill replay of other programs
B00I3MNGCG,Jason K. Roberts,4,This is different than what's out there now. I liked it enough to give it another chance if they decide to continue it. Not my favorite out of the originals that aired but will definitely give it another shot.
B00I3MNGCG,Jason Nobody,5,Fantastic concept. If this was a series... I would have watched it in a weekend. Certainly a show worth making.
B00I3MNGCG,J. Hedgepeth,4,It sort of like Nashville except its more on the comedy side and has better music. I think it could work and hope it makes it.
B00I3MNGCG,J. Miles,4,The episode drew me in and I wasn't expecting it.  I'll be disappointed if this one doesn't get picked up for a full season.
B00I3MNGCG,John R McGonagle,4,Really liked this. This year has some very strong contenders on Amazon originals. Great concept Great acting and smart. Green light it.
B00I3MNGCG,Jolene Ebe,2,The show was ok at best. The acting was ok and the music was amazing but it just seemed to be missing a decent plot line. I was very disappointed with this series especially after reading other reviews for it.
B00I3MNGCG,Judith A. Smith,3,Would like to see more.  Difficult to really say how well we liked it.  Need to see more to give a better opinion.  Story did not totally but we would watch more episodes.
B00I3MNGCG,Judy B,5,I enjoyed this pilot very much! The acting is really good and the setting and story lines are very entertaining. I look forward to watching more!
B00I3MNGCG,jv,3,It was OK.  I would probably watch more episodes but I wasn't really drawn in.  The main theme of musicians having sex with each other and playing musician drinking games seems to overshadow the larger plot.  The characters are good although I had trouble telling some of the female characters apart.
B00I3MNGCG,Katherine Holmes,5,It was very good.  I really liked it. I would highly recommend it.  I would like to watch this series.
B00I3MNGCG,Katt,3,Although I am not that familiar with the nature of the symphony orchestra I found this particular drama well worth watching. It gives an excellent insight into such world. The characters are entertaining and I really like the actors as well. If you enjoyed the hit series Smash you will definitely enjoy this drama.
B00I3MNGCG,Kee,5,I watched this program with no expectations.  I did not read the synopsis or the reviews. I must admit i luved this program. the characters are beautifully written and the story unfolded with ease and at a good pace. I found myself invested in the young woman's journey. I look forward to watching Mozart in the Jungle.
B00I3MNGCG,Kerlyn,1,I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes which to me is the &#34;grab us&#34; part of a storyAlso the F bomb is just said to often.
B00I3MNGCG,KF Boise,5,I'm a sucker for stories about the struggling artist and this episode really made me happy.  I hope Bernadette Peters and Malcolm MacDowell are featured in the series a lot as I love both of them and of course the "bad boy" conductor can't go wrong with me.  I liked the actual musical performances that have been mixed into the story as well.  If the series continued like the pilot I would definitely get hooked.  It's like a better and more grown up version of the series "Fame"--which I enjoyed watching when I was young.
B00I3MNGCG,Kim F. Bell "Movie Buff",3,There were some good moments in the pilot. I especially loved the music. The big thing lacking is a tension between the between the two conductors -- almost there but not quite. The same can be said about the other characters -- the chemistry is almost there. I believe if given time to mature this will become a fine series.
B00I3MNGCG,K. Moore "daxem",5,I was really not sure what to expect with this one. I really liked the dark humor and the setting is really interesting.
B00I3MNGCG,Knight of Ni,5,Very nice. Great acting and storyline. Instant hit! Bring it on please. This could really be something really really special.
B00I3MNGCG,lilblondjen,5,Of the Amazon pilots this is the one I would watch consistently.  It is different and captivating.  I really hope this becomes a series!!!!
B00I3MNGCG,Lizard Lilly,5,I love the story angle of this show. It's the behind the scenes life of artists and all their eccentricities!
B00I3MNGCG,Lorie A Stevens "LAS",5,I really enjoyed watching this pilot.  The possibilities for story lines are endless.  Four of the five new pilots were winners and this was one of them.
B00I3MNGCG,LR2003 "GG",5,I really enjoyed this pilot! I am hooked and looking forward to it very much. The characters are wonderfully interesting and I already care what happens to them.
B00I3MNGCG,Marci,4,looking forward to checking out more. Who'd have thought the classical music world could contain such darkness. very interesting show.
B00I3MNGCG,Marian Becker,5,Thank you Amazon for some great entertainment that is worth watching.  Every pilot I watched was wonderful.  Looking forward to more episodes
B00I3MNGCG,Mark Burns,5,They have to make more of these. I loved the pilot. It was smart and NEW. It was great to see such accomplished actors playing well written parts.
B00I3MNGCG,Marlon,4,It's the classical music version of The NBC show Smash without the camp overtures. Not perfect by any means but an entertaining 30 mins of television.
B00I3MNGCG,MarquisMark,5,I wasn't expecting much with this pilot. I figured the music would be a small part of the pilot. I was surprised how I was pulled in to what was going on and started to get invested in the characters.Call me surpised.....and very pleased.
B00I3MNGCG,Marten G. Evertz,5,I want to see another episode right now.  Great cast and production value.  They left me wanting more.  Hope it goes into production.
B00I3MNGCG,Matthew Adsit,4,The dynamics between the characters is what really drives the show. This about music's influence on those who perform it. It really seems takes over their life because it is their passion and they are performing at the NY symphony. This is above all how musically inclined people live and what they do in their free time (which can seem puzzling).
B00I3MNGCG,M. Boeder "La Fleur De la Vie",5,Great concept. Solid actors and performances and fresh content. I really wish this show gets picked up!! I want to see more :-)
B00I3MNGCG,Nathaniel C. Konemann "indieN8",5,Love seeing the secret lives of people who may be stereotyped as mild-mannered. Definitely portrays classical musicians as rock stars.
B00I3MNGCG,NHShopper,4,It has the potential to be entertaining and I like the classical music setting for a change. Hope the characters are complex and the storylines are rich. Thanks for making a show (or at least  a pilot) with a little class
B00I3MNGCG,Nime,5,its very much like showtimes half hour comedies. this is beautiful and has so much potential. i am especially excited about the setting within the symphony its pretty much uncharted territory. i just hope it excels where smash failed. i am sooo loooking forward to this.
B00I3MNGCG,Paul Fischer,5,What an interesting premise and context. The world of classical music. How new and different. Here is an antidote to network sitcom despair.
B00I3MNGCG,PoohBearsf,5,Can't wait for this show to get produced!! If I could binge watch it now I would. The characters are great and the music is wonderful.
B00I3MNGCG,pupucat,5,This is a really interesting premise--behind the scenes at an orchestra. The cast is quirky and interesting. i want to know more about them. Acting is very good. I really enjoyed it. I hope it gets picked up. I think it's better than most of what's on basic television.
B00I3MNGCG,Rburch,3,This could be an entertaining show once the plot develops more. Acting is good. Theme is believe able . Interjection of humor into the events as they unfold are a plus.
B00I3MNGCG,Richard Siegmeister,4,A great cast and I loved the setting in the world of classical music.  A great balance between comedy and drama.  Reminded me of the Paper Chase.  Please make more
B00I3MNGCG,Rm1985,5,I wasn't sure what to expect with this show. I have to say I'm impressed. I could see this maturing into a great show. It's something new and not the same old same old. I think that's what made it so entertaining.
B00I3MNGCG,R. Miller,3,I would need to see a couple more episodes to figure out if I would stay with it or not. Has it's moments.
B00I3MNGCG,robert robinson,2,I likeed the music but maybe a little Vegas would help to put a little life into it. If it's going to be for adults keep it that way. Step it up a little. Good luck.
B00I3MNGCG,Ruben,1,Please don't waste your money and our time. Move on to a better story. This show is horrible and can't get any better.
B00I3MNGCG,Saint Louis "Chick",3,Pilot has real promise but the threat of drugs and sex is a real turn-off for me.  Music...music...music with the highs and lows of competitive musicians should be enough....maybe with sex thrown in.  Ew on drugs after the latest overdose death.
B00I3MNGCG,Sareeta,5,The highest praise I can give is I want to see more.  Great acting and casting; I want to know more about the lives of these characters and see the world from their point of view.
B00I3MNGCG,Scott Dyer,4,This look behind the scenes of classical music was fun and possibly believable.  The actors were great and made for some remarkable performances.
B00I3MNGCG,Scotty,5,I like the layout of the story so far and looks like this seen can get crazy quick. Really short though if they are going to be thirty minute episodes they are going to need a couple a week to keep audiences interested. I am a fan of classical and symphonic though. Not a lot of that so far so if your looking for a new drama watch out for Rodrigo and the gang.
B00I3MNGCG,Serenity Rock,4,The setting was clever and appealed to my curiosity. The behind the scenes insights into the &#34;Classical Music&#34; world was a plus for me. The characters were interesting enough and less predictable. I think I can guess what the next episode may be but I think the writers might challenge predicatabilty based on some of the pilots twists. Promising .
B00I3MNGCG,Sierra Banack,3,I liked all of the characters except the conductor. He seemed (and this may be the writing) too much of a stock character. Yuck. It has potential though.
B00I3MNGCG,Snedew,4,Was entertaining but didn't fully hold my attention the entire show.  The need for sexual innuendo may be it's success and demise at the same time. Worth a watch.
B00I3MNGCG,Spencer Nassau,5,A great start for the show that is adult in humor and has an interesting story and great potential to shine.
B00I3MNGCG,techgear,2,This is nothing more than a nighttime sop-opera.  I love classical music and more specifically Mozart so I was hopeful when I started watching the program.  However what I found was just another Smash (NBC TV Series) only instead of Broadway as the setting it was Symphony politics.  Of course it includes the customary injection of liberal social values that entertainment industry loves to promote.
B00I3MNGCG,Uncle B,4,Loved it. Such a great idea. Can't wait to see the next episode so please green light this show. Make this show everything that Smash couldn't be because it was on network tv.
B00I3MNGCG,Varun,5,They can do it with little less skin show and sex. But story line is good and it can be a great show. looking forward to it.
B00I3MNGCG,Vin Dizel,2,It felt like 30 minutes of porno dialogue with the intercourse removed. Nothing against the mature content. Reminds me of a young adult novel for young women.
B00I3MNGCG,Walter Orlandini,1,Worst series I have sampled lately.  Plot made no sense. Abandoned it after less than 10 minutes.
B00I3MNGCG,Wayne Midkiff,2,I have not found this rocking my world yet. I will give it another try and watch one more episode.
B00I3MNGCG,W. Mcmanus,2,Might be well made but I did not care for the storyline at all. It just didn't seem to go anywhere other than &#34;day in the life&#34; meanderings of artsy New Yorkers.
B00I3MNGCG,Woody,5,This was a very good pilot.  I liked the story line and the character development.  It seems like a show that would continue to be interesting to a wide variety of people.  I'd watch more episodes for sure.
B00I3MNVBW,Amazon Customer,5,I love football.  One of my favorite movies was &#34;The Replacements&#34; and this show gives me that same kind of feeling only in a TV show.  It looks to be loaded with some great comedic characters and a dynamite set up.  Keep shooting this show.  I also loved Natalie Zea in Justified and it's nice to see her getting the chance to lead a series.
B00I3MNVBW,Amazon Customer,5,The cast was interesting and the comedic timing was great. I want to see the characters flushed out.  Can't wait to see more
B00I3MNVBW,Amazon Customer,1,This was a terrible show. Didn't laugh once. Horrible characters. Stupid plot. Waste of time. And why does the constant dropping of the F-bomb strike this show's writers as funny? Natalie Zea should go back to Justified and forget this disaster ever happened.
B00I3MNVBW,A Sawyer,5,This looks like a great cast with good writing. The potential for cameos is also intriguing. Can't wait to see it picked up.
B00I3MNVBW,Ashley,5,I loved the premise of this show! It was something I could watch with my boyfriend or my parents. Great humor and wonderful acting. Josh Peck was perfectly cast. Hope this is made because I would definitely watch multiple seasons.
B00I3MNVBW,Badassbubbaj,5,This show was very entertaining and it is always good to see a show about football.  I hope it gets picked up!
B00I3MNVBW,Barb in Savannah,4,I liked the pilot seems a lot like Necessary Roughness with a few various turns. The main character is a good actress. I will watch more episodes.
B00I3MNVBW,bc,5,I like the show.  Very funny and I really hope that the pilot makes it.  Very funny cast and Natalie Zea is awesome.
B00I3MNVBW,Bonnieboop "Major Reader",4,Will be interesting to see where the writers take this.  Dumb blond who's not so dumb inherits a sports team and doesn't have a clue.  Appoints her man Friday to manage it.  Hijinks ensue.  Holds promise.
B00I3MNVBW,Brian "GlobaltechATLAS",5,I enjoyed hearing people talk the way they actually do and not 'censored' for tv.The monkey is awesome and needs to make a cameo in every episode if you pick this up.
B00I3MNVBW,Brian Jones,1,Not cool.  Love the lead actress.  Just not into this type of comedy.  Sorry Amazon.  I am required to write more words so let me just say that I don't want to watch the next episode.  I didn't even finish the pilot.
B00I3MNVBW,Brick,4,I laughed out loud a few times and Natalie Zea makes everything worth watching. Ok it's a little corny and over the top but still watchable.
B00I3MNVBW,B. Slack,3,Cast is more likable than many of the first batch of Amazon pilots. Given time for the cast and crew to gel and determine a solid direction this could be a good show.
B00I3MNVBW,BudDel "Bud",1,I didn't care at all for the plot or the acting. This is not a show that I would ever watch any episodes.
B00I3MNVBW,Chad Echo,2,Stayed through the cringeworthy player cutting scene with Affion Crockett. The cutaways to the FOX analysts was just dumb. Hayes MacArthur was inspired casting but that's about the best I can say for this. I'd rather see Natalie Zea in Californication.
B00I3MNVBW,Christopher,4,It was pretty funny.  I noticed there is a bit of that Blue Mountain State type of writing in it.  Don't go to far into that territory becuase BMS was funny but only for stoner college kids or drunk frat boys.  I don't usually like anything to do with sports type shows but this one can probably grown on me.  It definitely made me laugh and I'd be curious to see where it goes.
B00I3MNVBW,CMM "CMM",4,Gutsy and human woman won't let the bullies tell her what to do and in the mean time gives us lots to smile about.
B00I3MNVBW,CO GIRL,3,I only got the trailer and it was too late in the evening to go through the process of getting it on my computer first and then getting it on the roku.  I'm sure it's good but I really haven't seen it.
B00I3MNVBW,dalanation,5,I liked the first episode. Hopefully they'll make more. (A partial repeat of my previous but rejected review.  Rejected apparently because Amazon doesn't allow certain words like &#34;min*imum&#34; and &#34;co*unt&#34;.  Wow.)
B00I3MNVBW,Daniel Clausen,4,The show looks like it could be a good drama and a solid comedy.  I am looking forward to more episodes.
B00I3MNVBW,David K.,5,This show was great. What an exciting concept to base a show off of. It is going to be a huge success for Amazon if they make it!
B00I3MNVBW,David Linder,4,Its funny and has some good acting. I love football and hope that if this series gets approved that I'll have something to watch in the off season.
B00I3MNVBW,Dean R,4,Enjoyed the pilot of this show and it shows promise. I think Zea can hold her own as the main character. The show has the opportunity to go off in any number of directions so there are plenty of plot lines it can take. I really hope this show makes it.
B00I3MNVBW,DeeGee "Dee",2,Another sports-centric show--yawn.  This didnt grab me and when it was over I had no interest in seeing more.  Natalie Zea won me over but the rest of the cast got lost in unfamiliar-faceville.
B00I3MNVBW,devkar9700,5,Love the Premise!  I think this will find an audience.  Really want to see what how it unfolds for a season.
B00I3MNVBW,Diane Gordon,4,Natalie Zea deserves a leading role and this is a good fit for her. Also like Josh Peck as the newbie team GM and Hayes MacArthur as the somewhat obstinate QB. Lots of potential here - my only worry is that it's similar to USA's late dramedy NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. I really like the cast's chemistry and I'd definitely watch more.
B00I3MNVBW,Diane,4,I actually really liked this. I'm not much of a football fan - but it's hilarious. This and Bosch were my favorites!
B00I3MNVBW,Diane R.,5,this show needs to be made the story moves forward at a good pace and is well written I almost didn't watch it because its about football but its actually good
B00I3MNVBW,Donald Matthews,1,I tried watching and couldn't even finish watching.  It just wasn't very funny and not interesting at all.  I finish watching all 5 new pilots and this might be the worse one of the five.
B00I3MNVBW,D. Robertson,4,As the headline said I found it a little predictable but then most comedies are a least to some extent.  If it is made I will watch it because being predictable doesn't mean bad and the jokes were generally pretty good and well written
B00I3MNVBW,E3 "E3",4,Natalie Zea does a great job as the former cheerleader turned NFL owner widow and newest unwelcome owner of the Rebels.  Good supporting cast and decent writers give this a real chance.
B00I3MNVBW,E. Bailey,5,This is very entertaining. I really enjoyed the actors on the show. Natalie Zea can carry this show with her amazing looks and fierce attitude. She's great. Can't wait to see more.
B00I3MNVBW,Frances I. Tucker "babybee",3,Racial stereotypes;  Barbie doll athletic widow.  This could be the makings of a standard Hollywood high concept meme.  With work and some honest scriptwriting this has some promise.  Makes me wish Hollywood could try a little BBC casting where actors look like real people and not photoshopped dolls.  I would watch more if the plot progresses but I'm concerned about where this will go and grow.
B00I3MNVBW,Gerald Weis,1,I only made it 6 minutes into the show before turning it off.  Seemed like it was a good idea when I read about it but the language was terrible.  I can't watch this show with family around.
B00I3MNVBW,Giselle Achecar,5,Everything about this show is GREAT. I need a sixth star. Best of the bunch.Why is this damn thing asking me for more words?!
B00I3MNVBW,G. Johnson,4,I fairly mindless comedy with ample sexiest overtones.  Not sure the underlying story can carry this show for an extended period of time.
B00I3MNVBW,Greg Sylvester,5,This is a rather funny show and I went into it with low expectations because I thought it would be like that crappy unnecessary roughness show on USA- it is nothing like that turd thankfully! I really enjoyed watching this pilot and I hope the rebels gets a full season pickup!
B00I3MNVBW,Honest & Real,5,I really did not expect to laugh as much as I did at this show. I do hope this is 1 of the shows they decide to make
B00I3MNVBW,Jared Taylor,5,This was an insightful and funny series filled with zingers and dramatic comedic figures in a corporate sports environment.  This was well worth the time to watch and can't wait to watch following episodes.
B00I3MNVBW,Jason K. Roberts,3,It's different enough than most shows out there and thus worth watching. I would give this one another shot for sure to see where it goes if they brought it back but not sure how long it could last with the current story line.
B00I3MNVBW,jay,5,Was diffrent and entertaining .. Like the fact that know matter who u are someone thinks u can't do something an u prove them wrong
B00I3MNVBW,J. Coleman "Rich",5,This one looks like a lot of fun.  I like all of the characters and I can definitely see me rooting for the QB and the owner to get together at some point.
B00I3MNVBW,Jennifer W,3,The story line seemed a bit weak - but as the show moved on it started to improve!  Natalie Zea was great - some of the other actors seemed a bit weak compared to her.  Over all it was entertaining!
B00I3MNVBW,J. L. Schram "Shoe Critic",5,this is a little out there (a monkey with a gun is just plain silly) but this is like bad news bears for grown-ups and it is going to be fun. Love the cast choices. I would really like to see this one make it!
B00I3MNVBW,J. Miles,5,This show is funny. When I first read the summary I was very skeptical but it delivered.  Please make multiple seasons.  There is a &#34;snow&#34; monkey with a gun!!!! This is awesome!!!!
B00I3MNVBW,Joe 1015,4,There are no sports comedies out there and 'The Rebels' are in a good position to succeed. Good writing and the cast seems to have the potential to be funny and entertaining. I like the pilot and wouldn't mind watching a few more episodes.
B00I3MNVBW,John R McGonagle,5,Really enjoyed it!! Great cast with good chemistry. Just wait for the monkey! Please pick this up Amazon. Definitely my front runner so far.
B00I3MNVBW,John Ward,1,After hearing the curse word MF in the first few scenes I trashed it. Not worth watching in my opinion!
B00I3MNVBW,John Winner "JHW",4,I found the pilot interesting. The pretty lady is smarter than she looks. Not sure about the pretty guy (who she makes manager). But I will watch new episodes of this.
B00I3MNVBW,Jolene Ebe,5,I wasn't sure if I would like this since it was a football show but figured for one episode I would try it. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the show. The story line was great and had some pretty hilarious moments. I would definitely watch the show if it did come out.
B00I3MNVBW,Judith A. Smith,4,Liked the concept and the fact that the woman owner was so strong and stood up to other owners.  Would love to see this continue.
B00I3MNVBW,Kari Hampton,5,I really enjoyed this one - My fingers are crossed that they continue making more.  There was such fun and real chemistry with the characters and it made it fun to watch.  I was bummed that there weren't more episodes to continue the story!
B00I3MNVBW,Katherine Holmes,4,I am not a sports fan but I enjoyed watching this pilot.  I would watch more like it.  It was good.
B00I3MNVBW,Kathy,3,Waiting to see if it gets better.  It has a lot of possibilities and could be a really good show or not.  I will watch a few more episodes to decide.
B00I3MNVBW,K. Moore "daxem",5,This was really good. It was like a mix of Necessary Roughness and Major League. It was cast very well and while the story runs through some well tread Sport-Movie/Show ideas it is really well written and makes you want to see more.
B00I3MNVBW,Knight of Ni,5,Loads of potential. Yes please. Great chemistry and writing. Funny cast. Love the monkey with the gun. Make it so.
B00I3MNVBW,LAC,5,Am extremely picky about how I spend my time... rarely give any of it to tv shows.  This show was totally worth my time - it held my attention from start to finish.  Very well written and the cast is top notch.  I look forward to adding the Rebels to my must watch list of 3.  GREAT job Amazon...
B00I3MNVBW,L. Browning,2,This is OK but it is so tough to believe the story line that it becomes more stupid than entertaining.  It could have potential if you made it more believable.
B00I3MNVBW,Leslie J McGrath,2,Do we really have to have another show where people behave like juvenile idiots? I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00I3MNVBW,L. G. Gerstle "East Coast Knitter",4,This comedy is far better than most on network programming. The setting should provide ample opportunity for all sorts of comedic situations. Acting is very good. Much better humor than on Betas.
B00I3MNVBW,Lisa M. Ludwig "booklover",5,I thought I was getting an entire season ...loved this pilot. Please continue. Holds so much promise. Great acting great story. More
B00I3MNVBW,Looking for a Blockbuster,5,I enjoyed this fresh new comedy.  Cant wait to see the next episode of this funny show. Keep them coming.
B00I3MNVBW,LRF1964,3,Good cast. Fair writing. Grind down some of the sharp edges of the stereotypes.  The viewing public is a bit more sophisticated than your writers think.
B00I3MNVBW,MargyL "MargyL",3,The storyline was no surprise though I kept watching because I just wanted to see what man would be Natalie's nemesis in the show.  Held out to the end to reveal.  I would watch more of it to see how the story develops but they need more characters you can care about.
B00I3MNVBW,Mark Burns,5,I can't wait to see the rest of the season. I like the concept. Natalie Zea plays a great part.
B00I3MNVBW,Marley Hansen "Marley Hansen",4,Characters were very believable and funny. loved the rookie VS  GM Scene. Hope Amazon continues this Sports comedy. Good acting
B00I3MNVBW,M. Boeder "La Fleur De la Vie",3,It made me laugh and by the end of the episode I sort of cared for the characters.  I think I could watch this.
B00I3MNVBW,me,2,There is far better writing and comedy in the Amazon Pilot program.The same ol'formula will get the same ol'laughs...Not impressed at all.There is an instant lack of credibility when the PFL gets thrown into the mix..
B00I3MNVBW,Mid-Century Todd,5,Loved the premise that a widow inherits a NFL team and doesn't know how to run it like the &#34;good old boys&#34; want her to. Characters are interesting and fun. Great scenes with the excess of the players. Can't wait to see how it all plays out. Always love routing for the underdog.
B00I3MNVBW,MikeyC,5,This is by far my favorite of all the pilots on Amazon. I would watch multiple seasons of this show. I will lose faith in Amazon if they do not sign it on for a full season. Very original sports plot that has tons of promise.
B00I3MNVBW,Millie Lee "Love Southern Fiction",1,Everything about this show was boring and predictable. I watched about half-way through and started falling asleep. Natalie Zea is pretty though.
B00I3MNVBW,Miss DIckens "Miss Dickens",3,Pilot seemed a bit banal in the plot line; characters were somewhat engaging and they may improve over time.  I am willing to watch a couple more episodes to see what happens
B00I3MNVBW,Music is good for you,3,I liked what Natalie Zea did in Justified and may have a hard time seeing her in other roles but she's a good actress beyond being extremely attractive.  Many of the characters are funny and the writing is good but its just another &#34;team of professional sports underdogs&#34; offering.  We'll see if they can make it worth watching.
B00I3MNVBW,Nana C,5,We can't wait to see what two inexperienced neophytes to the world of sports come up with next.  It should be interesting.
B00I3MNVBW,NC. movie man,5,I'm not much of a football fan but this l will keep watching everyTime it comes on enjoyed the first show hope it will be in the line up
B00I3MNVBW,Ned "Porschephile",3,This was pretty over the top with the amount of drug use and the premise has been done before in both football and baseball (see Major League).  Limited potential for future development.
B00I3MNVBW,Nicole,4,Nice to see  New show about sports. I can see females watching this if they like to laugh and like football.
B00I3MNVBW,Nime,4,happy to see josh back on TV this sort of comedy is not really my thing but many people warm up to it the premise is unique and couldn't stop laughing the humour is a bit broad but it speaks to an audience and i can see it doing very well.
B00I3MNVBW,number one reader,1,I couldn't even get all the way through it. I was not impressed at all. They should toss this one.
B00I3MNVBW,optimus,5,The storyline was excellent! The characters and their roles were excellent! the actors and actresses were excellent. Everything was excellent. The show was really funny and made me very interested to see more. Had this been a full season just added to prime I would have pressed &#34;Next Episode&#34; till the season was over
B00I3MNVBW,Paul Fischer,4,I enjoyed it very much and I hope you will produce an entire season.  Very funny. Great cast and good concept.
B00I3MNVBW,R Brownfield,4,Football is very popular and if done right it could be a fun series.  This senerio has been done before.  The pilot was enjoyable to watch but plot is shaping up to be the same ole stuff.  Keep it fresh and don't be so obvious.  Lets hope this turns out better than it predecessors.
B00I3MNVBW,reader,4,I am not convinced there is enough to hold the interest of non US football fans. Not being one of those fans I have my doubts.
B00I3MNVBW,R. Miller,4,I would watch this as a series and recommend to my friends. Adults only as lots of R language here
B00I3MNVBW,Robert Harrison,3,...I'll watch the next episode. Full of time-worn and predictable dialogue and old jokes. It's on par with major network sitcoms.
B00I3MNVBW,robert robinson,4,The show is interesting that makes me believe that there will be more twists and turns in the coming shows. Good Luck.
B00I3MNVBW,Saint Louis "Chick",3,Every cliche in the book....and did we have to portray a female owner as an accidental owner who is a simpleton?
B00I3MNVBW,Seb311,5,A good start to the series. Sort of like the football equivalent of Major League. If its picked up I would watch more.
B00I3MNVBW,Sheree "Shar",1,This pilot was so boring that I only watched about 10 minutes of it.  The whole &#34;fish out of water&#34; storyline has been done better with better actors then these.
B00I3MNVBW,Sierra Banack,5,Love it! I love everything about it. The leading lady is amazing! Simply amazing. Great comedy! Please continue this show.
B00I3MNVBW,Spencer Nassau,5,A good introduction that has the potential to be a great show mixing comedy and drama while drawing in sports fans.
B00I3MNVBW,S. Ranson "Early Adopter",1,The crazy players are one-dimensional and the lovable happenstance GM seems like this is the role he always gets stuck playing. It just tries too hard and is too predictable. The only thing evenly slightly funny was the monkey snippet during the credits.
B00I3MNVBW,Stacy Harman Holloway,5,I've loved Natalie Zea in Justified and was delighted to see her in The Rebels. What a funny show! This morning on the way to work my husband and I joked about all the bad Atlanta drivers and wished we had a coked-up monkey with a pistol too. We started laughing again about the monkey and just couldn't stop.I really hope they put this one on!!!
B00I3MNVBW,Steve Lilly,4,Lots of characters to play with. Plenty of ways for the story to go. Always fun to see the big guys shot down.
B00I3MNVBW,Sue Boyle "blue9244",4,I thought I had previously reviewed this pilot.  I would like to see it become a series. I like all these better than I like the one with John Goodman.
B00I3MNVBW,Sylvester Fields Jr.,4,I really thought this was a very well written comedy. The cocaine monkey and the gun had me laughing so hard. I like the story line is really a good for a comedy!
B00I3MNVBW,Tony,3,I felt like I've been there before. Not a new idea as far as script goes but enjoyable.  would I watch more episodes?  Yes
B00I3MNVBW,Tullynme,3,It seems this premise has been done in multiple formats involving and a sundry of sports and reminded me of the Hangover movies maybe it was the monkey? But likely the sophomoric humor. On the bright side is Natalie Zea who is exceptional as the ex-cheerleader/trophy wife of the late owner of the Rebels.I would probably watch more episodes before I wrote it off completely.
B00I3MNVBW,Uncle B,5,No great sport sitcoms since Arliss!! Let's go!! Can't wait to see this show.Can't believe someone hasn't made a show like this before now.
B00I3MNVBW,Valerie "exprincess",5,I absolutely adored this pilot and definitely want to see more! Entertaining premise and a very good cast! Loved it!
B00I3MNVBW,William M. Powell,1,Rich bitch suddenly owns a football team and calls uniforms &#34;costumes.&#34; That sure sounds like a laugh riot to me.
B00I3MNVBW,W. Mcmanus,4,The characters were funny and I can see this going lots of different ways to keep the fans interested. It's a familiar storyline but updated for the current generation. Let's hope it gets made!
B00I3MNVBW,Wolfgang "Film & TV",4,looks very promising..... funny stuff.I would definitely buy more episodeshope that it gets a go from Amazon studios......
B00I3MNVBW,Woodson J. Savage,3,Light-hearted comedy would have to see how the story line develops.  Might become redundant over time.  It has possibilities.  Need to see more episodes.
B00I3MPDP4,Amazon Customer "Busy Person",4,This show was easy to watch even though I prefer comedies to drama. I am interested to see how they develop the character of Bosch. It seems like he has quite a bit of baggage.
B00I3MPDP4,Amazon Customer,5,Loved it! This show moved at a perfect pace for me. I loved the actors and am curious to see where things go with Bosch and his cop pals. Bring it on!
B00I3MPDP4,Amazon Customer,4,There is a high potential for this show to be quite entertaining.  This is my 2nd favorite of the pilots.
B00I3MPDP4,Amazon Customer,2,Didn't find the storyline engaging.  Characters seemed to do the best they could.  Script is needs more effort to engage the viewer
B00I3MPDP4,Amazon Customer,5,I really hope this show makes it for a full series. Very good storyline with great acting. Looking forward to seeing how it unfolds!
B00I3MPDP4,Andrea D.,2,I thought this was slow. I have read the books and was very excited to watch it. I didn't finish this first episode. It just felt really slow.
B00I3MPDP4,A Sawyer,4,I thought that the pilot episode was great! The story line was easy to follow and the characters were likable. I will watch this show again.
B00I3MPDP4,Badassbubbaj,4,This was a really good pilot and I would like to see where this show can go.  Awesome main character and good story line!
B00I3MPDP4,Barb in Savannah,5,I think I could get hooked.  Lots of great actors from other shows I enjoyed.  Hurry up and produce more episodes.
B00I3MPDP4,Baroque Music Lover,4,I can see a lot of promise in the pilot.  I hope that it will catch on and become a series.
B00I3MPDP4,Big A "Wesley",5,I have never read the novels about Harry Bosch and came into this show with no preconceived notions. I was drawn within the first minute and really hope Amazon makes this show. If the don't will have to give the first novel a try. I need to know what happens next in the case and hoe Bosch's trail resolves itself. The cast is excellent and they all feel 100% authentic. Please make this show!
B00I3MPDP4,Bill,5,A very good show... One of the best offerings in the last few years in my opinion... I hope they pick this show up... The cops aren't idiots as is seen in some shows...
B00I3MPDP4,Bill "I'm a Hispanic man who likes mostly non...,1,I think this is a twisted mind's series. It has little appeal to me. I do not have anything of value to say about it.
B00I3MPDP4,BM3,5,This was a pretty good pilot that provided a good plot and some intrigue. The characters are interesting and the ending leaves me wanting more. I hope this pilot turns into full series. This pilot was much better than The After pilot.
B00I3MPDP4,Book Lover "Black Book Lover",5,I was suprosed how much I liked this. The lead has a lot of potential to develop. Great story. Riminscent of the Killing.
B00I3MPDP4,Book Lover,2,Just wasn't that good. The dialog was very predictable and the actor who played Bosch just doesn't work as a star. I doubt that I would make this part of my regular viewing.
B00I3MPDP4,Brick,5,This is good stuff! More please! I watch a lot of shows/movies in this genre and this is right at the top. Not perfect but very very good. Can't wait for the next one! It was cool to see some &#34;The Wire&#34; alum in there too not to mention Herschel...after having been decapitated recently.
B00I3MPDP4,B. Slack,5,Good casting.Nice writing.The feel of it kind of reminds me of a darker version of the Jesse Stone movies.
B00I3MPDP4,CareTaker,3,Starts off as little formulaic. Sullied cop/agent who has no life but work and Devil-may-care attitude.Solving crimes like no one else. How is this different from 15 other shows like this?
B00I3MPDP4,Carlos Sullivan,5,Great pilot episode!  I hope Amazon decides to continue this show as it is one of the best cop shows I have seen in a long time.
B00I3MPDP4,Cherbear1,5,Good action and keeps you watching the show.  The detective is very troubled but he is good and just got a bad rap. Will keep watching the show.
B00I3MPDP4,Chuck "RcProductions",5,I enjoyed the pace and plot line of this new project. The main character is intense and single minded when it comes to his job. We can't wait to see how this turns out.  I hope we get the chance.
B00I3MPDP4,Clbrosch "cbchess",5,Very well written screen play. Great Actors doing a very good job.  Can't wait to see a whole season of this.  Good character development already in just the pilot.
B00I3MPDP4,Crafts lover.,4,Too short. Are there going to be more episodes. It is  a crime to tease like this.
B00I3MPDP4,Craig in IL "EasyDailyLiving",5,Bosch is terrific in Michael Connelly's books.  Amazon has done a good job representing him in this pilot.  Can't wait to view more.
B00I3MPDP4,crosscountryman,5,I am very impressed with the cast's performance; especially the lead.  Well played and settled upon a subject that many have experienced and have never faced head on.  This series promises to deal with controversial cases stemming in areas possibly not dealt with in depth.  Hope it becomes a series!
B00I3MPDP4,C. Tully "Chuck Tully",3,I have read multiple Bosch books and enjoyed them all.  His book character is complex and I hope the writers and director can do the same thing with him in the TV show.
B00I3MPDP4,cynthia,5,I love the series of books by Michael Connelly! This story was a great place to start for the pilot. Viewers get to see glimpses of Bosch's past and how it makes him who he is at present. I hope it makes for the whole season plus some. I would even like movies about Harry Bosch. They could tie them with the Lincoln Lawyer as they are half brothers. Cannot wait fore more like this!!!!!
B00I3MPDP4,Dan Hawks,5,I loved the pilot of this series. And I want to see more of it!! It surely has my vote!!
B00I3MPDP4,Dan,5,This a very good show with great acting and dialogue.  Welliver does a fine job and the whole thing is a great interpretation of the Connelly book.  Please make more.
B00I3MPDP4,David Evans "vdodirector",4,Good pilot. I like the realism and the complexity of the characters. It kind of reminds me of &#34;The Killing&#34;. I could see watching this.
B00I3MPDP4,David K. van Hoose,5,Interesting Police drama with interesting characters.  The show had me hooked in the first 3 minutes and I was really hoping to learn more about the case Bosch took on as he was trying to work thru a court case.
B00I3MPDP4,Deborah J. Towns,5,I would place this show on the top of my list-right alond Di Morse-jane tennison-detroit 187 and so many others that showed great potential only to be axed. Come on guys- when will you give us some real adult material and scrape rookie blue for instance!
B00I3MPDP4,DeDe "DeDe",5,Nothing I hate more than investing time in a show only to have it disappear. Titus Welliver IS Harry Bosch. This series is one of my top ten reads and I read a lot.I am pleased to see it brought to tv. I waited to watch the pilot hoping for more episodes-but decided on this boring Sunday to give it a go. So very glad I did. Nicely done amazon NOW at least give us a date to mark on our calendars for the rest of season 1 and hopefully more to come.
B00I3MPDP4,destiny 3,4,I watched too many book characters ruined by television or film but they got this one right. I really hope we get more episodes. The cast was also quite believable in there roles.
B00I3MPDP4,Diane,5,Couldn't stop watching. Great job! If this is an example of how the series will be - I will not miss it!
B00I3MPDP4,Diane R.,5,either this or the rebels is going to get made it is a good cop drama  however it ends on a cliffhanger so if it isn't made you will need to read the book to find out what happens
B00I3MPDP4,Diane S,4,I thought it was a little slow.  If they pick up the pace a bit it could be a must see series. I definitely want more back ground on the suspected serial killer he kills at the beginning of the show.  I'm sure if this becomes a series it will come out during the trial.  Characters were pretty good. Titus Welliver plays his character very well. I'd be interested in watching more and see how this develops. I also want to him to catch the person responsible for killing the boy they found in the woods.  I suspect there's more then just one out there.  I have not read the books but I think I will now.
B00I3MPDP4,Donald Matthews,5,I have just starting reading the Harry Bosch books.  From the 3+ books I have read so far this pilot seemed a perfect adaptive of the characters and feel of the books.  I think Titus Welliver is exactly how I invisioned Harry Bosch to look and act.I thought the pilot was great and made me want to see more.  I hope Amazon picks up the remaining season. This could be the series Amazon prime needs to get the positive recommendations like House of Cards on Netflix.
B00I3MPDP4,Douglas A. Weber "mainstream reader",4,While the way in which he gets the child case while on trial is rather contrived and unrealistic the situation that it sets up could provide a good season of shows!  I am looking forward to seeing more of these!
B00I3MPDP4,D. P. Lance,4,First I'm a fan of this Character have read most of the book in this detective series. Cast is well chosen  Pilot is a little slow but worth the view.
B00I3MPDP4,D. Robertson,5,I loved this series and can't wait to see more!  I have seen Titus Welliver in other things before and thought he was great but he maybe better in Bosch than any of his other roles
B00I3MPDP4,E3 "E3",5,I never read the books but after viewing this episode I will.  Excellent writing and casting and casting Titus Bosch was a stroke of genius.  Already a winner.
B00I3MPDP4,ES,4,The Bosch actor is a good choice.  The Connelly Bosch novels are a good basis for the series.  The teleplay was well written (by Connelly) and the acting is good.
B00I3MPDP4,Fiona Cat "Fiona Cat",5,The acting is engaging and includes a very talented cast. The writing is excellent in Connelley's Harry Bosch series-based drama. The  pilot leaves the viewer wanting more. This one should make for excellent continued viewing.
B00I3MPDP4,Franklin Dogood,5,Solid acting and an interesting story.  Titus Welliver was a great choice as the lead. I hope this turns into a regular series.
B00I3MPDP4,FUBAR-EOD,4,A cop that is not always doing the &#34;Politically Safe & Correct&#34;.  The &#34;JOB&#34; is portrayed as his whole life in the pilot.  Can relate to prior policing experiences.
B00I3MPDP4,Gerald Weis,1,I fell asleep watching it and won't watch anymore episodes if they decide to make more.  What I stayed awake for seemed to be well made though.
B00I3MPDP4,Glasgowgal "Glasgowgal",5,I loved the pilot.  It sucked me in right from the start.  Great cast.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B00I3MPDP4,gpat65,5,I do love police dramas and this was great. I would like to see a lot more of this series. Characters are great. Please continue this series
B00I3MPDP4,Gregg Davis,5,The pilot was excellent! The show had an excellent cast and compelling plot. I Can't wait to see more episodes
B00I3MPDP4,Greg V,5,Very well done adaptation of the Michael Connelly character.  Titus Welliver was well suited for the lead role.  Character interaction was very good and the plot interesting.  I'm ready for an entire season of Bosch.
B00I3MPDP4,Honest & Real,2,I really am stunned that this show seems to be getting the highest rating of all the new original pilots. It's like all the other crime/cop dramas on TV already
B00I3MPDP4,Hrothgar,4,The show has promise and a very good cast. I thought Titus Welliver was the weakest casting choice as I am a fan of the novels but had a difficult time seeing Welliver as Bosch. The pilot had a nice gritty feel to it and deserves a chance to develop into a full series.
B00I3MPDP4,JAinATX,5,The only thing bad about this is the fact that it's one episode and nothing is solved unless they greenlight the series.  Compared to the other junk Amazon has it should be a no brainer.
B00I3MPDP4,Jake A.D.,5,A well acted &#34;muder-death-kill&#34;-esque show that seems less formulaic than most network crap.  I hope Amazon picks this up for full production.  It would be a excellent addition to the more light-hearted &#34;Betas&#34; and &#34;Alpha House&#34;.
B00I3MPDP4,Jane Smith "Jane Smith",5,I enjoyed the pace of the show and liked the characters on the show. There were a lot of actors/actresses on the show that I recognized from other television shows. I really liked the storyline. I am interested in seeing how the investigation into the death of the child progresses. I thought the inclusion of jazz music throughout the more serious show was great. It kind of lightens the mood. I really hope Amazon picks up this series.
B00I3MPDP4,Janette M. Guyre,3,I read the book and hope it follows that story line but I am tire of the burnt out detective who drinks and smokes but I think it might be good and  would watch again
B00I3MPDP4,Jared Taylor,5,This is a well produced show exploring the fine line between police work and crossing the line into a darker killing mentality.  I was pleasantly surprised at the acting and instantly drawn in and held by the story line.  I hope this becomes a successful series.  Can't wait for the next episode!
B00I3MPDP4,Jason K. Roberts,4,Was worth the watch but fear this is going to end up being just like every other law enforcement sitcom out there which has been beat to death. Will give this one another shot if it continues.
B00I3MPDP4,jasper,5,Thiis represented a good adaptation of Harry Bosch as characterized in Connelly's novels.  I hpe to see this series picked up by Amazon prime so that members have the opportunity to view the series.
B00I3MPDP4,J. Coleman "Rich",5,I love this one and Titus is amazing.  I really love the possible love interest (lady beat-cop) for him as well.
B00I3MPDP4,Jill Taylor,5,We really liked this one. We only recently learned about this series by this author and find it gritty and tense.  The characters were well cast and we were left wanting it to continue.  Hope they will make new episodes SOON.
B00I3MPDP4,Jim,4,Enjoyed the new pilot.  Hope you keep it alive.  Looking forward to the new series.  Good depth to characters. (1).
B00I3MPDP4,J. Lyn Morris "Lyn Morris",5,Really captivating story...and hope that this runs as a series so we can see how it turns out for Bosch.
B00I3MPDP4,J. Miles,2,The episode barely kept my attention and I was not left with a feeling of wanting to see more.  It won't be my first choice if I'm looking for something to watch.
B00I3MPDP4,Joe 1015,5,Titus Welliver is perfect as the main character. Good beginning. Bosch can be among the best crime drama on television if the series keeps the pace and tension like the pilot. There's a lot of opportunity to explore Bosch the detective and the man. Great job by Amazon.
B00I3MPDP4,Joe,4,This was great. Titus Welliver really knows how to act. The mood is brooding and the writing is smart. Hope it gets ordered to series.
B00I3MPDP4,John P Viveiros III,5,This Prime series is off to a grand start and I can't wait for further episodes. Yes I think you should continue this series.
B00I3MPDP4,John R McGonagle,5,The best show Amazon has backed yet. Phenomenal cast and the unknowns really support amazingly. I need more of this. Best cop show in a long time.
B00I3MPDP4,Jolene Ebe,4,I loved the cast of the show and it was very well written and acted. The only issue that I had with the show is that it seemed almost like any other crime TV drama out there right now. I would definately watch it if it came out as a series but was hoping for a different twist almost.
B00I3MPDP4,jonnie l carter,4,i'm sure i will like it very much. i like all of the authors novels. now i have a face(that i like) to put to Harry' s carehcter
B00I3MPDP4,Jose Suerte "Jose Suerte",1,The lead is a depressed bore and the other characters are stiff and cliche. The LA setting is done well but that is about it
B00I3MPDP4,J. Woody "NaNa",5,I was stunned when the episode ended. I totally forgot that I was  watching a pilot and went to play the next episode.Looking forward to the series and definitely hope it won't take long.I would have paid to watch this in a theater but it's even better because I'm in the comfort of my home.
B00I3MPDP4,Katherine Holmes,4,This is the kind of show that my husband would enjoy.  It has good plot and detail.  I liked it.
B00I3MPDP4,Kathy,1,Another show extolling the virtues of addiction and self-abuse.  I hate watching train wrecks and people hurting themselves and this show is nothing but that.
B00I3MPDP4,KF Boise,4,I've read several of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch books and have really enjoyed all of them.  Titus Welliver does an excellent job of playing Bosch and he fits my vision of Bosch very well.  I look forward to more of this series !  Good job Amazon--so far every one of your pilots is something that I would watch.
B00I3MPDP4,Kim F. Bell "Movie Buff",1,A big Yawn. A standard police drama without an interesting hook. Titus Welliver is a wonderful actor that deserves stronger story lines.
B00I3MPDP4,Kindle Customer,5,Can't wait to see the whole season.  Best of the bunch.  Good casting and excellent writing.  This would easily become a program we would watch weekly.
B00I3MPDP4,K. Moore "daxem",5,I liked the pace of this show and was really annoyed when it ended and I had no more to watch. Everything about the show was well done from the acting to the story. I really hope we get some more of this one.
B00I3MPDP4,knowident,5,Los Angeles as the main character. Too cool. To quote another iconic Los Angeles cop: &#34;This is the city.&#34;Come on in... If you dare.
B00I3MPDP4,Lawrence Tuczynski "godzillamusic",5,The pilot episode was very good and left you wanting more. Hopefully Amazon will make this into a series as part of Amazon Prime and not charge per episode. If they do that I'd watch it.
B00I3MPDP4,Loretta Mederos,5,I hope this continues. Great storyline and acting. Quality drama right up with the Inspector Lynley Series of character from book to show
B00I3MPDP4,Lorie A Stevens "LAS",5,I really enjoyed watching this show and hopefully the many positive reviews will entice others to watch it as well.
B00I3MPDP4,Lynn "Bashira",5,I hope Amazon decides to produce a full season of Bosch. It's interesting plot and characters are worth developing further. Look forward to viewing more episodes.
B00I3MPDP4,MargyL "MargyL",4,The show is off to an interesting start.  Titus Welliver is his usual solid self and does a great job in the lead.  The jury is still out on whether or not the writing will develop enough to hold one's interest in a time when there is SO much to watch of high quality but I'm hoping that it does evolve into a five star show.
B00I3MPDP4,Marian Becker,5,It was wonderful to see one of my favorite characters come to life.  I am looking forward to more episodes. Thank you Amazon for some great new shows.
B00I3MPDP4,Marley Hansen "Marley Hansen",5,I have to commend Amazon on this original.  It left me wanting more after its conclusion. Here's hoping that this one will make the cut. Very well-defined characters.
B00I3MPDP4,Matthew Adsit,5,The acting and story are very interesting. Bosch's moral dilemma from the shooting combined with his empathy for the victim at the newly discovered crime scene is powerful. The show should continue because the pilot was so good and the audience really wants to know what will happen.
B00I3MPDP4,M. Boeder "La Fleur De la Vie",3,I like the premise of this show but I think that it didn't move at an even pace.  The end of the pilot episode was quite captivating making Bosch more human.  I would watch it but I'm not intrigued to know what happens to any of the characters in the show. It could be great though.  It's hard to judge a show by only one episode.
B00I3MPDP4,michael kallal,5,How long do we have to wait before we get another episode?  I liked the characters.  I am not familiar with the books but would be glad to see more episodes from this pilot.
B00I3MPDP4,Michelle,4,This is just the first episode but so far so good. If the rest of the show keeps a steady pace this will be a keeper. I look forward to seeing episode 2.
B00I3MPDP4,Miki Turtsanyi,4,I've seen the lead actor in other films and series. I hope this one gets made. He seems to portray the role of experienced cop very well.
B00I3MPDP4,Miss Amanda Marie,5,Great show can't wait for more please bring more I haven't read the book and I am still crazy about it
B00I3MPDP4,Miya McKim,4,As the story unfolds the seams begin to catch back into the cloth&#8230;what you think the story line is becomes more convoluted and the patterns reveal tears; intrigue leaves you wondering if the protagonist is victim or perpetrator.  I liked the characters and the story line; I was drawn in and want to know what happens next&#8230;.
B00I3MPDP4,Moss,1,Really did not care for the show. The character was robotic and lacks emotions. Hope this show does not make it over the other shows.
B00I3MPDP4,MountainMan "David",4,Bosch holds great promise with the suspenseful ending despite the fact that the ending credits revealed Bosch's &#34;inner demon.&#34; If you want to be &#34;spoiled&#34; go back and check out the ending credits again. The acting and drama is good despite the over-concentration on  Bosch's smoking habit. This could be a great series.
B00I3MPDP4,Music is good for you,5,I've greatly enjoyed all of the Michael Connolly &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; novels and can't think of a better actor to portray this complex character.  Physically Titus Welliver is exactly how I imagined Harry Bosch and Mr. Welliver certainly has the ability to play the well-worn and wise Bosch.  This was a great first episode of hopefully a long running series with plenty of material with which to work.
B00I3MPDP4,M. Whitehead,3,There is nothing really new here. I give it 3 stars because it is well done but I wont watch it again. If you like police dramas this show is for you but it feels much like every other show on tv about detectives.
B00I3MPDP4,Nana C,5,This was a realistic crime show.  It was interesting and held your interest to the end.  We look forward to the solution.
B00I3MPDP4,Noodler,4,I can't decide if I like it after only one episode. The pilot is pretty well done and interesting. likeable characters. I'd like to see more episodes.
B00I3MPDP4,number one reader,5,I gave this pilot 5 stars because of Titus Welliver...he absolutely nailed the part. I love everything this man is in. Please please make more Bosch!!!!
B00I3MPDP4,Pat Choate,5,Great new series.  Please put all episodes in first season so that I can binge watch.  This is a winner.
B00I3MPDP4,paula h "p.e.",2,I turned this off after the opening scenes...it didn't engage me. It might so well on network broadcasting...maybe even cable but not up to Amazon standards.
B00I3MPDP4,Paul Fischer,3,Stopped watching. Smacked of network TV. I like more of your push the envelope series rather than following same old patterns.
B00I3MPDP4,Peggy H. Rose,5,This is far better than most of the police procedural series on broadcast TV.  Hopefully it will be picked up and made into a full scale series on Amazon and available on Prime.The script was crisply written and the acting uniformly excellent.We will be looking forward to the rest of the series as Bosch solves crimes in LA.
B00I3MPDP4,Pen Name,2,I found Bosch to be a slow paced show.  I had to fight to get through the entire episode.  This is a show that I could live without.
B00I3MPDP4,Peyton W.,5,My favorite of the pilots that I've seen! Please make more! The cast is incredible and the characters are remarkable!
B00I3MPDP4,Rburch,5,Get working on the rest of the series. Top notch acting by great characters. Great book series to make a show from. Up there with or better than in its own way than House of Cards on Netflix
B00I3MPDP4,reader,5,At last an interesting Cop from our own neck of the woods. Great new show from the writings of Michael Connolly we can only hope that Amazon has the good sense to make this as well as The After. Complex characterisation and an intriguing plot make this a must watch. Also there is enough going on in the pilot to keep us guessing for an entire season.
B00I3MPDP4,Rebussmile,5,Now that &#34;Inspector Lewis&#34; is gone a really great detective thriller would be great.From what I have seen so far this show meets all the  requirements. I have readall of Miichael Connellys books and this show is authentic . Titus is the perfect pickfor the lead character &#34;Bosch&#34;.
B00I3MPDP4,Reggie,5,Fun lookin show! Has quite a few cast members from the Wire. That's reason enough for me to root for it.
B00I3MPDP4,Richard R,5,This follows the books written about Bosch very closely. The acting is very good and I am looking forward to seeing more new additional shows.
B00I3MPDP4,robert robinson,3,It's a common fact that a polieman will win everytime in court on a one on one situration because no one else is there. This is nothing new. It would be stupid for a person to reach for his pocket when a man has a gun pointing at him. Bosch said that the man wasn't unarmed but the show failed to show us any weapons. Bosch should have left his partner with the bone scence in the woods and found something else to do and got the run-down on things later. This show needs to be speeded up a little. Good luck.
B00I3MPDP4,Rosie,4,The Bosch character was intriguing and made me want to champion him. The supporting cast was &#34;meh&#34;. Better actors could've been cast to make a more enjoyable episode.
B00I3MPDP4,ryan halbrook,5,More now please.  I've waited for these books to be made into something for the longest time.  I think they've found the correct medium.  Only thing is I want the rest of the episodes ASAP!
B00I3MPDP4,Sally Dinovo "TV & Movie Junkie",5,To begin with I love Titus Welliver in anything. Can't wait to see more of this story. Is Bosch the abused or the abuser. Hope to see this soon as a new series. As one person said...Wow!!!
B00I3MPDP4,sam,5,LOVED THE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF BOSCH.  IT HAD THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SUSPENSE.  BUT I WANT TO SEE MORE.  WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS STORY LINE IS GOING TO END AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EPOSIDES.
B00I3MPDP4,Sam,4,Storyline left me wanting more. I've been ready the books so enjoyed the show don't wait too long before coming out with more
B00I3MPDP4,Sashin,4,Interesting characters..lead is sort of typical...cop with a chip on his shoulder about seeing justice done...and goes overboard most of the time.  But I found it intriguing and would like to see more.
B00I3MPDP4,She Knows,5,I hope Amazon picks up this show...  It is intense and every character seems to offer a great intriguing story .. Was the doctor really just finding out about the bones?.... What past is that female officer running from?.... Bosch seems to be perhaps the only 'normal' character in the story.... but everyone around him promises to unravel a world of drama.... H'm let's see more!!!
B00I3MPDP4,Snedew,4,Typical crime drama show not nearly as good as some such as Luther (best I've seen).  But will do well.
B00I3MPDP4,Steve,5,If you are a fan of the Harry Bosch book series by Michael Connelly you should love this show. I'm looking hope that Amazon is planning more.
B00I3MPDP4,Sweetpea,5,I think I've watched four of the pilots now and this one by far is my favorite!!  Excellent drama without all the unneeded raunch and profanity.  Can't wait until it's a series.  Bring it on Amazon.
B00I3MPDP4,Sylvester Fields Jr.,5,This is a very well written script with a great story line and would love to see where it goes given a chance.
B00I3MPDP4,Uncle B,4,This is a cop show that I can really enjoy. I'm tired of all of the formulaic cop/detective shows on network tv.Make this show!!!
B00I3MPDP4,Varun,5,This is a great story and very well told in first episode. The pace is perfect and acting is superb. I haven't read the book but think the pilot is pretty close to it.I will definitely like to watch it as a full fledged show.
B00I3MPDP4,violet rose,5,I was very impressed...........I really hope this gets picked up.............I cant wait to know what happens.............it kept me wanting more..............loved the characters - well acted - nice to see familiar faces :)  great storyline..............what else can I say exept amazon this is a keeper !!!!
B00I3MPDP4,Virginia,3,It is like a show that would have worked 20 yeas ago.  Now it's just one in a large field of crusty cop shows.  Sorry.  The author got screwed on this one.
B00I3MPDP4,V Johnson,3,I felt it started a little slow but the story line got better as it went on.  Are they trying to rival the Wolf of Wall Street with the use of the F*** word so much.  There is no need for that.  Bosch has a better command of vocabulary that that is not needed and slows the enjoyment of the plot.  The doctor was a very good choice for supporting actor and would be good to incorporate in later shows.  The actor chosen as the coroner was an excellent choice.  I'm not so sure that I like the actor chosen for Bosch and he really shouldn't be smoking so much.  It hurts his character. It may get better with future episodes depending on how the story is developed.
B00I3MPDP4,Walter Orlandini,5,Bosch must deal with a civil suit for unjustified death while investigating serial killers burial ground. Well acted and fast moving.
B00I3MPDP4,White Raven "zxy",3,This is a well crafted show with good performances and an okay script.  I made it thru the fifty minutes of this episode but was not intrigued enough to return to it.  I guess I have seen one too many shows like this with a hard boiled detective who is dedicated to doing justice but whose flaws get in the way of his own life.  This is one of the better examples of that genre but I want to see something that reinvents the game.
B00I3MPDP4,Wolfgang "Film & TV",4,Looks very promising. Definetely one of the better cop show episodes I've seen in a while......Love that Titus Welliver finally got a lead role..... great actorAmazon Studios should make this and keep the quality as high as in the pilot
B00I3MPDP4,Woodson J. Savage,4,Great potential series.  Very intriguing beginning.  Strong cast from the lead on down.  Very good story line with a lot of sub-plots.  It I had to pick a winner here...this would be my choice.  Looking forward to future episodes.  Holds your interest.
B00I3MPDP4,Youngatheart,4,Good plot line. Can't wait to see it as a series. It offers competition to "True Detective".Excellent. choice of actors..I'm having a hard time judging the emotional capability of the main character.
B00I4QRAUU,Jerry D. Mills,3,Sorry to say tht Elijah does not make a convincing piano player.
B00I4QRAUU,Samantha Penigar,5,I have now seen this film twice and I liked it even more the second time around.  The second viewing kept me in the same state of suspense and on the edge of my seat as it did the first time.  As a pianist I enjoyed it even more.
B00I8YKI02,Anthony J Perri,4,Think Two and a Half Men with Minnie Driver playing the Jon Crier role...David Waldron is very appealing and talented and the little boy is a superb actor...isn't at the level of Two and a half but certainly has the potential...give it a try
B00I8YKI02,B. Merrill,5,I cant wait to see the rest. A typical single guy in the dating scene has a life changing event when a neighbor moves in witch a teenage boy its very funny. He makes friends with the boy quickly and attempts to be a role model for this kid. His mom typical single mom with trials is having a rough time of coping after re locating to the us she is trying to get it together while her son and adult child are  having fun of their own. Great show think its going to be a major hit.
B00I8YKI02,Brenda Santiago,5,It caught my attention immediately... I thought the cast had great chemistry... and story line too... kept me wanting to see more... and good values to the story line... lesson learned..
B00I8YKI02,LLB52,5,We missed this episode so bought it last night.  Didn't want to miss one!  Love the stars of the show!
B00I8YKI02,Monica A. Sloan,3,Enjoyed the first couple episodes but supect those to be enough for my viewing pleasure.
B00I99TN70,Charlene Perdue,1,First off Jackie Christie is such a fake and this season she has found her some minions to follow her and a couple of them must have a little bit of hood rat in them.  I watched 2 shows and decided that this season is a waste of time so I won't be renting any more.  Maybe next season you will bring back some of the original cast and it will be worth watching.  Please get rid of Jackie.
B00I99TN70,FLOWERPOWERMD,4,I LIKE THIS SHOW  . THE ACTORS ARE NICE BUT WILD AND DONT CONTROL BEHAVIOR I GUES THATS WAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORI REALLY LIKE MALYASIAI JUST WISH THAAMAZON PRIME STOPPED CHARGING ITS LOYAL PEOPLE FOR EPISODES IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IR SOME REWARDS PROGARM TO OFFER  BUY MORE GET MORE OR EARN REWARD S FR FREE SHOW S .. I AM CUT THE CORD AND DONT WANT HE BILL FOR  CABLE SHOWS TO GET PILED UP
B00I99TN70,Jennifer Hampton "Hampton Reviews",1,That is really how bad the show is. It's so bad that I'm speechless. I only watch this show when I have nothing else better to do. &#34;BLAH&#34;
B00I99TN70,mistic,3,It had some drama but not as much as i wouldve hoped to see.......... dont know exactly why that is. hmmm?.. Anyways umm this season jackie actually makes me kind of like her... surprisingly she was not so bad this season. Malaysia hmmmm i dont know whats with her this season i think she over analyzes things too much and then everything just goes awry. Draya surprised me! So kudos to draya for finally not looking like a punk. But at the same time draya pissed me off with her arrogance like hunny its not that serious tune it down babes........ your cute but its not that serious mama. The other cast mates were alright............ I dont know this season just was a little too short and not enough action. But it was ok
B00I9AGNQS,abond007,5,Just as great as season 2. Story is developing great and the new lands are breathtaking. Really captures the culture of both vikings and christians in that era amazingly.
B00I9AGNQS,Ann M. Hoffman,5,Same as  season I .cant say any thing different than I already have So please read season one to see my  5 star review
B00I9AGNQS,Barbara Watson,5,I have only seen 1 episode and had to pay extra for it so the pleasure of watching it was greatly reduced.  It would be better to wait until all of season 2 has been filmed and them offer it as season 1 was.  It was fun to watch the main character's ego take over as he became successful and it was interesting how he loved his brother enough to save his brothers life.
B00I9AGNQS,Bill,5,A good drama with a historical prospective. The Vikings and other Middle Age peoples were tough because they had hard lives we can not imagine. Go Ragnar!
B00I9AGNQS,bob is dead,5,I love this show.
B00I9AGNQS,Bonnie B. Dudasik "SilverSage",5,I admit it took me awhile to watch this series but once I did I was truly impressed. I like the authentic feel of the sets and landscapes.The fact that they incorporated actual historic people in the story line made me keep watching. I highly recommend.
B00I9AGNQS,codyaya "codyaya",5,The story is interesting and true to the period. The cinematography is absolutely mesmerizing. Watching this series is more like watching a feature film on the big screen. I can't wait for Season 3!!!
B00I9AGNQS,C.S.,5,We had not seen this series and enjoyed being able to get up to date.  Very captivating and have recommended it to others.
B00I9AGNQS,Denn,5,Can't comment ethics he is my ancestor sort of.....
B00I9AGNQS,forex review,3,I wish I had a 3.5 for this one.Not for anyone with a weak stomach and the writing could be a little faster.  It's more interesting for the history (false or not) the show takes you back to days seldom talked about and understood.  Worth a buy but it's no 5 star show!
B00I9AGNQS,George Beltz,5,The first episode had me guessing and sitting anxiously awaiting the next episodes. The show has a good cast and storyline.
B00I9AGNQS,Jared,5,This is a gritty grimy battle ridden story or story novel about the myths and legends of the vikings.  It is a history fictional be it of how the vikings are and were.  Another hit by fx.
B00I9AGNQS,John C Woods,5,This show maybe hard to watch for some but it is a portrayal that is very much worth seeing and thinking about.
B00I9AGNQS,Keats,5,Very entertaining if this is the sort of thing you like. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone though.
B00I9AGNQS,Lauren,5,Vikings holds true to its name. This is an AMAZING show and become a fast obsession. The characters are engaging and so believable. This show will not disappoint.
B00I9AGNQS,MARK J. LONG "Martok",5,Interesting look into history of Norsemen and their desire to explore and survive !Good historical story line . Series worth watching !
B00I9AGNQS,maryoneal,3,Disappointing in the finale scenes.  Too much detail giving over to personal violence. O. K.  we got the themeof the Vikings inclination towards revenge....I did not need to see it over and over.  I kept waiting for thehistorical importance of the revenge rituals.  Hopefully in Season 3 - the writers will provide more depth.
B00I9AGNQS,Melissa,5,Amazing visuals! Great show! I love when educational programming can be so entertaining. I often forget that this is based on actual history (in a good way).
B00I9AGNQS,Pamela "pvs",5,Love the actors. It is very raw. The way it probably was to a large degree. The relationships are very interesting. I was sad that the lead guy left his beautiful wife. I like the wife and I totally understand her needing to give it up and walk away after another woman bares his child.
B00I9AGNQS,S. Warren,5,This show still gritty and gory.  Surprises me the direction is goes.  Vikings doing what Vikings do hehe.  Though the main character has surprised me and Wondering what other messes he can create in his life as if that was enough with him attack England.
B00I9AGNQS,thehorrorwithin,3,This is a smart show with well written characters.  I imagine we will see many more concept shows advertised as being ripped from history which should appeal to a broad audience.  My one complaint is that we don't spend enough time away from the main character to gain empathy for anyone else.  It's a fascinating look at a strange and exciting marauding culture.
B00I9AGNQS,Thomas G Caulfield,5,Love this show!  I hope it continues for another season.  Very interesting subject which is very rarely authentically portrayed in movies or TV.
B00I9AGNQS,Wendell Clendennen "Stretch",5,The storyline is awesome and the characters are very well developed. One show and you'll be addicted to this series!
B00I9AGNQS,WildflowerLady,4,I am looking forward to Travis Fimmel (Ragnar) getting better with the acting but I really have enjoyed Gustaf Skarsgrd as Floki!
B00I9COR96,B. Merrill,5,A typical family comedy with a lot of love and laughter love the spin they have put on this show to separate it from some of the others out there. The dad JK Rollins or Mel Fisher is blind and very able to do everything a regular dad would do. Typical family issues and an ongoing separation of two parents who clearly still love each other. I strongly suggest watching this show it will definitely make you smile.
B00I9COR96,JSB,3,I enjoyed the pilot but have to say I don't see this show lasting for too long.  The narration gets a little tedious and it's kind of a &#34;hug and learn&#34; sort of sitcom.  That being said love JK Simmons and would watch again.
B00I9COR96,Penny Tunnell,3,I enjoyed this show but it never really grew or improved as it went along. Jenna Elfman is extremely talented but was way underserved and underused in this. She deserves way better!!!
B00I9M44E4,BlueCrabVintage,5,Always a great show and their new building looks great!
B00IA2FABE,Deltasunset,5,I knew I would enjoy this but was delighted when I LOVED it!! I was really using it for background music on mornings while getting dressed for work. I.  found myself sitting and watching instead of dressing.  Great songs.Great concert.Great entertainer. I love Pink.Soon to be 65  and still dancing.
B00IA2FABE,Journey "Journey",5,This concert is so so so so good!!!!!!!!!!  I'm 45 & I've still never made it to any concert in my life. This video filled in my long lived desire to see one. If you love P!nk....................GET THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00IA2FABE,M. HARRIS "MAVDRAC",5,This was full of the awesomness that is Pink. This tour showed her musicality and athleticism as well as her tenderness absolutely loved it.
B00IA2FABE,Nance,5,Pink gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance.  The woman is a force of nature.  No one can comes close to her live act.She just gets better and better each year.
B00IA2FABE,Rebecca,5,I like to watch concerts during the day because I don't feel like I have to see everything that happens to enjoy it. I can do other things and still hear the concert. I wouldn't recommend this concert for young viewers as there are some explicit lyrics and some sexual lyrics and dancing. But it's an extremely enjoyable concert that is fun and has lots of good music. It made me happy after watching it and motivated me to get up and move around instead of just sitting on the couch.
B00IA2FABE,Route66Review,1,What the hell?  This video was an acrobat show.  I wanted to see PINK from the start of her career when all the dance hits made her.  This new stuff sucks.  If you're into the new PINK...this is right up your alley if you have an alley?  If you prefer the older more hip hop version of her you can forget it.  What she does sing from the good ole' days is butchered to the new PINK style.  She could have at least mixed up a little old with the new.  For me this was lame.  She's long ago forgotten what music really made her famous.  So sad. You can tell she owns stock in SPANKS. LOL
B00IA2FABE,S. Collins,5,Great show.  High flying acrobatics and awesome routines.  She covers her first songs to her newest songs.  After watching this I definitely want to go see her live.  Pink is a jack of all trades and a powerhouse performer.
B00IA2FABE,techie mike,5,Pink is one of the sweetest and honest people in the business.  I have the pleasure of working with here in L.A. and I have always thought she was one of the most talented and REAL Music entertainers I have worked with.  I think this concert shows you how she is to everyone.  She is a Star!
B00IA3TFI2,RiverRunner13 "River Runner",3,It's ok.  Looking back it was just such a media circus.  Worth a watch if you want to see the beginnings of stupid media reporting.
B00IAKL5S8,cozzetta,4,Loved it!
B00IAKMVHM,Bette Self,3,Hard to follow some of the story line. Didn't like most of the characters. Settings for most scenes wasn't very attractive.
B00IAKMVHM,Beverly A. Peeples "Gatorlaw",5,Got used to mediocre nut fun movies from older stars in this genre. This one is better than most and had some good twists-so the unexpected elements made it more enjoyable. Fun and smart-liked it a lot
B00IAKMVHM,David S. Cowan,4,This Heist movie was hilarious and the.  plot twist was a total surprise.  Kurt Russell was so fun as an Evil Knieval motorcycle jockey.  Really fun!  The movie had flavor of the Big Lebowsky at times with Kurt's down and out Character and also some Ocean's Eleven with a Con well played.  No real female role to speak of.  The supporting cast was wonderful.  A very funny Guy Movie that my wife also enjoyed...
B00IAKMVHM,helena,4,I liked the movie. It wasent as quite as good as I expected but toward the last half hour it was pretty good. Kurt Russell has always been a good actor. I like him as an actor. Im glad he is making movies again. Hope it continues.
B00IAKMVHM,Jared,2,This is a feable attempt at a play on words with the title.  It says that it is a sneak peak before it goes to the movies but it is never going to make it to the movies.  I do not recommend this movie unless you are a cheese ball.
B00IBJ1XOE,Danny L. Abernathy,3,the storyline is very syfy but the filming is very low techthe acting is flawed yet adequateall in allthis movie is a great waste of timeyet enjoyable
B00IBJ1XOE,will crow,4,this unique material was filmed beautifully. i was charmed by the scenery and found the concept of time travel and multiple universes intriguing.
B00IC9X09O,Benjamin H. Massey,5,Best show on TV right now. Full of plot twists and plenty of squeamish moments. I can't get enough of it.
B00IC9X09O,Bill K,2,In my review of season one I had written that I felt this was an odd interpretation of the Thomas Harris characters. Season two though has taken it to an all new level. This supposedly was a prequel to events in the book and movie Red Dragon. Yet in this season they are killing off characters that play pivotal roles in both RD and SOTL. So how exactly does that work ?What the writers have done to the Will Graham character here makes the events that occur in Red Dragon impossible. A case of "you cannot get there from here". As a stand alone series this can be interesting. Any link to the stories of the author Thomas Harris have been tossed to the wayside.
B00IC9X09O,Dean W. Wood,5,This season is getting even better than Season 1. With the first opening seen with Hannibal and actor Lawrence Fishburne in a deadly fight. It grabs your interest from the first scene. I also love that each title is in Japanese and relates to the episode in some manner. Well Done!
B00IC9X09O,L. John,3,I didn't care for the first few episodes where our hero was in prison having hallucinations and such...but it's really picked up since he got out.
B00IC9X09O,Mark D. Allison,5,Dining has become an obsession of mine since I saw and Loved! season 2 of Hannibal I do hope there's deal on whole season in future.
B00IC9X09O,Spike,5,Hannibal is the only TV show that I really can't miss.  I tell my friends that I don't go out on Fridays (while Hannibal is airing) and then I re-watch it the next day on DEMAND just to catch all of the details and the awesome acting.
B00IC9X09O,thehorrorwithin,5,This season came out swinging for the fences!  My wife and I are glued to the screen.  Highly recommended.- the horror within
B00IC9X09O,Tim O'Brien,5,Hannibal is great not because of Hannibal himself but because of Will Graham.  Will is delightfully arcane and peculiar as he searches for the killer.  His morality is absolute.  He will kill the killer if that is what it takes.  I love this show.
B00ICGY6R2,Amazon Customer "spedteach",5,I haven't watched Survivor the last few times but I got hooked on the show this time.  Maybe it was Tony.  Maybe it wasn't.  Not sure.  I just know that I was glued to the tv during this season's episodes!
B00ICGY6R2,April McAbee "AprilMcAbee .com...Future autho...,5,I love survivor and having missed the finale episode Amazon came to the rescue.
B00ICGY6R2,BHoward,5,My husband and I started watching Survivor as a fluke because it was on Amazon Prime.  We have bought all of the seasons available and are looking for more Amazon!!
B00ICGYECE,Carla tamari,5,Heart.love with a great case of tongue in cheek. (could be in your cheek). If you have any sense for a good time watch this show and start routing for you favorite ladies.  We can learn a lot from lady boys.  Love you Ru.
B00ICGYECE,M. Mara,5,RuPaul and her girls are back! I'm so happy. If you haven't seen this show it's never too late to start. A reality show with talent and a sense of humor.
B00ICGZIKG,Cathy Hinds,1,Low budget not worth the time to watch. Wasted the money to buy it. We didn't even finish pilot show
B00ICGZIKG,michele symonette,1,At first I thought it would be a mad max type of movie but it wasn't at all interesting or my type.
B00ID4I2HS,Ginger L. Gilmore,5,Humor and speed
B00IG1AL8Q,Gunner,1,Total waste of time and money. Didn't laugh ONCE! Story was TERRIBLE. Acting was good- it was a waste of the actor's talent.
B00IGDH9W0,Matein Movies,5,A throw back to the Rock Hudson/Doris Day movie days. Romantic comedy at is best. A must watch movie don't miss it.
B00IGDH9W0,Twilight Mom,5,Another Great Kevin Hart movie. **Adult Content**
B00IGDHQEQ,Glen Pridgen,4,This is a great chick flick. I bought if for my daughters and ended up watching the whole movie. I enjoyed all of the characters including Zac Efron...who is growing on me. Rent the movie and watch it with your significant other. You're welcome.
B00IGDHQEQ,Matein Movies,4,I like Zac Efron he reminds me of a young Tyrone Power. He is in the developing stage and when he finds his ticket. He will  be everywhere. This story is not his fault but he did his best. Mark my words.
B00IGDHQEQ,Nicole Smith,3,Some funny parts.
B00IGDHQEQ,t2tigger,5,Took a everyday life situation & was able to make fun of it in a fun way.  A great young adult movie.
B00IHC9CIE,Jessica Balyeat,4,Many places that the GAC goes to is just filled with an incredible amount of history.  And then when they start their lock downs I always find myself chuckling at least once.
B00IHC9CIE,John C Miller,4,This is a great show it has evolved over the years becoming less investigation and more entertainment.  It is enjoyable but take it for what it is a tv show that fights with every other show for ratings.  As long as you do not take it to seriously and understand that most of what happens most likely is just for entertainment and not real ghost hunting you can have fun with this show.
B00IHC9CIE,Kathryn L Khanzadeh,5,This show is fun to watch.  Zack and the lads have such a passion for their work that it is infectious.
B00IHC9CIE,Shelley Danica Black "Race it & take it!!!",5,Ghost Adventures continues to push the buttons of ghosts & demons. Not sure if it is a great idea as I know they have had repercussions sometimes. I do wish them all the luck!&#128519;
B00IID0NPI,ccc,3,not sure if i like it or not and find out more later i might watch it again reminded me or roswell.
B00IID0NPI,Corvin Adkins "maguscorvin",5,This was a very good start - I look forward to more. Let's hope they can keep up the intensity.  The writers of the this show have pretty nice resumes and I think they have potential to really take this to the next level.
B00IID0NPI,JD Homewolf,5,This is entertainment all the way. You probably won't learn anything but if you enjoy sci-fy mixed with romance you'll love it.
B00IIVXMR6,Route66Review,5,This movie actually turned out to be very good. I was drawn like a fly to a blue lamp. A flick with much  more character substance than your typical zombie hack them up and eat them genre..  That being said-  this gore fest is a real shocking treat.
B00IIVXMR6,Timothy McGivney "Tim",5,This is not a gory zombie movie---deals with the aftermath of an outbreak. The writing and acting are top notch and there's a really cool twist near the end that you will not see coming.
B00IJIN72S,Lyna,2,It was a bit too slow and dull-witted for me.  I actually fell asleep while watching..... not usual for me.
B00IJKZY4A,Keats,5,amazing show. Everyone should watch this and it should be required in schools.
B00IJKZY4A,mary ruth,4,I believe that the new Cosmos has had a difficult time getting it's voice just right but my husband and I are beginning to love it!
B00IJKZY4A,Mike Hunt,5,Very good series that challenges conservative faith. A wonderful blend of all the sciences. Answers many questions religion dare not approach. Educational fun and challenging.
B00IJKZY4A,Rev.Carolyn J. White,5,I love this series.  I tape every show every Sun. night.  Just missed the first one.  Watched it with my seven year old grandson and he was interested also.  Easy to understand.  How do people still believe in Creationism?
B00IJKZY4A,Saskia L. Cohick,5,Great show.  This is a great flashback to the original Cosmos.  I hope it does for today's children what it did for me: developed my love for science and technology.
B00IJKZY4A,Teddy and Me "JLEE",5,This series is amazing! Neal deGrasse Tyson (Astrophysicist) is a fascinating presenter. I hope this series continues indefinitely. It is one of the best shows on TV currently.
B00IJNKQHM,Annette Cavanagh "coffee fan",3,From the start of the series I was intrigued by the story line and characters who themselves have complicatedhistories.  There is a whole lot of hurt and suffering and at times difficult to watch because of all the trauma  The writing is  sometimes not crisp and this adds to the burden at times..  The series is interesting but sad.The entertainment value of the series is the intricate plot line coupled with some good acting but any viewer should be aware that the content of the story is not all that pleasant.
B00IJNKQHM,carolG,1,Just disn't have anything new to offer other than the fact that the main character is a &#34;cutter&#34; which made her just a bit more interesting. Ireally like The lead actress.
B00IJNKQHM,Dona L. Sears "searsgig",5,gripping!
B00IJNKQHM,D. Tinsley,4,What only 2 episodes and it's gone. Is it gone for good. I didn't love it like Hannibal or Blacklist but it wa growing on me. Just wish what's happening to the series would be noted on the site where we order it.
B00IJNKQHM,Joi Mcclary,4,I like the chemistry between Catherine and Thomas. I think the guy who played the serial killer in the pilot episode didn't do a great acting job. I'm interested in learning more about Catherine's past.
B00IJNKQHM,Micky,5,Suspense grows with each episode and each episode is half &#34;story of the hour&#34; and &#34;on going drama&#34; with several twists (dark twists) but the 2 main characters are so well &#34;acted&#34; you are pulled in.  The perspective of the psychological behaviors explored in each episode are more than &#34;case book&#34; - enjoy this new show and hope the stories continue to be as good as they are now.
B00IJNKQHM,Nancy L. Burris,4,While it held my attention and it was some what interesting. There is just that little kick that it lacks. Maybe it will improve?
B00IJNKQHM,sybille ziegler,3,I have watched the original Danish &#34;Den som draeber&#34; and have to say it is way better than the softer American version. The US show is not bad but the original series is way more creepy/chilling.
B00IK96YXU,Ashley Thomas,5,My husband and I love this show! I love how this show is unexpected. You never know what obstacle or celebration will come next. I highly recommend the show!
B00IK96YXU,Belinda Roman,5,This season has been just as intriguing as the first season as we watch the Cold War unfold during Reagan's presidency.  Good TV so far.
B00IK96YXU,Bill,5,I like the period piece taking place in the '80s. The characters are believable and well developed. A good dramatic show.
B00IK96YXU,C. Hill,3,For some reason it appears to have more gratuitous sex scenes which do not appear to be germane to telling the story.  I still enjoy the shows overall though.
B00IK96YXU,Cyberwiz "Cyberwiz",4,Interesting story lines involving complex perspectives. The conflicted emotions the characters exhibit give way to embracing love of the mother country and finding out there are positive things found in the &#34;enemy's&#34; society as well.
B00IK96YXU,Dean W. Wood,5,FX creates another great season of the Americans. Being that I grew up during this period of time as a twenty something year old man. I remember the Cold War and the tensions with Russia. So glad it is not as intense now.
B00IK96YXU,Deborah J. Towns,5,A very interesting show that depicts the cold war very well. I love the characters. The acting is real and very believable.
B00IK96YXU,Denn,4,Well done
B00IK96YXU,J. Carpentier,3,It's good but (so far) lacks what made the 1st season so great. I'll keep watching because it is still quality...but this seems to be a sophomore slump.
B00IK96YXU,john charles &#34; chuck&#34; "john c scharri...,5,I have throughly enjoyed the series The Americans. I hope they will continue to write similar episode's in the near future.
B00IK96YXU,Kisa,5,Love this show. The writing is excellent. I just wish the episode had more meat in them. Each episode is like watching 20 mins for 2.00 per episode. ...
B00IK96YXU,K. Thomas,5,Funny they are switching roles. Great show.. 2nd Season better than the first. Which is unusual. Keep up the good work.
B00IK96YXU,MWOO,5,It captures the Cold War Era perfectly.  The casting of characters could not be better.It leaves a lot of thought in your mind long after viewing the episode.
B00IK96YXU,Nora,5,The show picked up right where it left off. Their daughter may be their undoing in the end. And the interest in the Russian embassy woman who turned herself in to the KGB really continues the intrigue.
B00IK96YXU,ORURO H.S.,4,This series is entertaining and totally ludicrous but entertaining. You can't really make a standard family story out of two spies who are heartless killers. And Phil's phony marriage is actually ludicrous The best part of the show is the neighbor Stan Beeman who is an FBI double agent who fall in love with his Soviet asset.
B00IK96YXU,Paul B. "mribp1",5,I grew up during the ColdWar. We studied about this type of Soviet activity in the US. Makes one wonder if he had ever met any Soviet mole. I find the acting engaging. The characters are very believable and interesting. The two main characters seem to have a soul.
B00IK96YXU,Phyllis,5,Really well done this show - I didn't think all that I was going to like it - I thought I was going to be probably just silly but in fact turns out it's really really good. We can't wait for each week's new episode!
B00IK96YXU,Rugby,4,This show is different exciting and complex. It has not received the attention it deserves yet. As good and somewhat oike Burn Notice with some twists.
B00IK96YXU,Stanley Cook,5,Great action story of a KGB family living in DC in the 80s.  Lots of blood and a little scary for some but a great story.  Looking forward to the next season.
B00IK96YXU,Subq,4,I chose this rating because of too much nudity and sexual scenes. I feel they could get their point across without all of that. Certainly not for children or teens. However the series has great acting&#60; a lot of suspense and intrigue. It keeps you guessing. We just fast fprward through the objective(to us) scenes! We lived through those times!!! amazing!
B00IK96YXU,vich,5,These writers deserve kudos for keeping it exciting and moving forward.  Most series that start off great get stuck in a rut with hit-n-miss episodes.  So far; they've kept it in the &#34;great&#34; category.With the uptick in Russian-American tensions; this topic takes on a new air of reality.I'm sad that there are only 2 episodes left to the season.  I guess that's better than Mad Men or Under The Dome that split their latest seasons into 2 years.
B00IKFSSTW,Amazon Customer,4,We found this presentation of events very interesting if not a bit daunting!
B00IKFSSTW,April McAbee "AprilMcAbee .com...Future autho...,1,This is a terrible movie after watching it I wished I had not wasted the time.
B00IKFSSTW,ccc,5,loved it.
B00IKFSSTW,Day Fan,5,Full of action and all.  I thought it was a well acted movie.
B00IKFSSTW,Jack E. Levic,2,It's interesting to think about life in POMPEII on the fateful day Mount Vesuvius errupted and ended life in the thriving city. The movie POMPEII caught my attention and I was imagining a somewhat historical tale of love and life in the time of disaster.It seemed like the filmmakers took the idea of a volcano errupting and worked a fantastical tale around it that is as ordinary as they come. Gladiator slave falls in love with rich beautiful young lady who is pursued by an evil politician.  There is so much to tell about POMPEII and the lives of ordinary citizens and the frantic desperate moments when they realized they were doomed.Buffed and chisled Kit Harrington loses his family in Britain and ends up in Pompeii as a slave who is fighting gladiators in the arena. He's again Jon Snow from GAME OF THRONES only in a different setting and time period. He does his best and lovely Carrie-Ann Moss always is worth watching. Maybe more of their love story in a different setting would have been more exciting.Kiefer Sutherland is the evil Roman Senator and Sutherland plays his character with some sort of stilted Briish accent. Why do characters set in ancient Roman times always speak with British accents?It seems like POMPEII has a sprinkling of the STARZ series SPARTACUS with its gladiator theme. The main action begins in the last part of the film as Mount Vesuvius finally errupts. Here is where the real story should be given more attention as terrified and desperate people are trying to escape while others are resigned to their fates.I watched the bonus feature about the volcano and the filmmakers say they followed the writings of Pliny the Younger who was a witness to the disaster. They said they followed Pliny's description of the erruption and the effects on the Bay of Naples. Imagine people trying to flee by ship on the unforgiving waters.  Here would be a fascinating story and it is addressed to some degree. Some of the visual effects are great. Others look fake.An attempt was made to tell an interesting story in the time of disaster but the whole film falls apart.
B00IKFSSTW,jjceo,3,This is an entertaining movie but certainly not a classic. Aside from the fact that Pompeii was destroyed the balance of the story is fictional and a mediocre copy of the movie Gladiator.Kiefer Sutherland is not my favorite actor and he did another poor job in this film by overacting. I like the characters of the Celtic gladiator and the daughter of the leader of Pompeii.I rate the film as a 3 star for entertainment. Rent it and watch it but don't buy the DVD IMHO.
B00IKFSSTW,MM,5,Really enjoyed the history lesson in this film. If you have been to Pompii and walked the streets this film brought it all to life. Kit Garington was great.
B00IKFSSTW,norma jean kringer,2,I thought this was about a volcano and chance of survival.  Gladiator vs. gladiator just didn't match the movie.  A waste of my time.
B00IKFSSTW,Scott C Piercey,4,A good theatrical version of the of Pompeii characters were interesting and intriguing. Good action and special effects. Liked the story between the 2 main actors.
B00IKFSSTW,seetheartsoftly,5,great movie love the film remind me of the old pompeii movie great dvd nice love story and action love it
B00IKFSSTW,Tara A. Hazlett,4,Pompeii was surprisingly a really good movie with a wonderful cast. I don't want to say much and ruin the movie for anyone but it has plenty of action and a little bit of a love story in it. It's definitely worth watching! Especially if you are into these types of movies which I love..
B00IKG21F8,A. Joseph Orlando,1,I can't really give an honest assessment because I shut it off after 30 minutes. But I can honestly feel good about myself for doing so in that I saved an hour of my life from witnessing this sad car wreck of a wannabe scifi horror thriller.
B00IKT36S6,Chris Winchester "mikeystoyz",5,I can tell that thought went into this series.  It is like filler between what happened in the movie with few things added in.  If you like the movie you will either hate or like this.  I happen to like it.
B00IKT36S6,David Asensio,4,it's a weird show i haven't seen any advertisements for it it is one of those stories told in reverse but explanations do come it has only 3 episodes so far i like what i have seen so far this is could turn out to be a hidden gem of a show a diamond in the ruff so to speak i will see as the series progresses so it is worth checking out
B00IKT36S6,JLH4,4,I bought the first episode it was free so I gave it a chance I was very surprised and very pleased my wife and I love the movie always love Robert Rodriguez's films the only sad part is we have to keep buying episodes but we are never disappointed
B00IKT36S6,Mike suell,5,One of my fav shows
B00IKT36S6,Timothy McGivney "Tim",2,I watched all ten episodes. There are a couple very cool action scenes (both involving Don Johnson) but the rest of the series is very hard to get through. Unlikeable characters and bad writing. Very disappointing.
B00IMYS1PC,Amazon Customer "spedteach",5,Love the characters in this show!  Josh Ewing just gets everyone riled up!  I especially love Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray!  Great storylines!
B00IMYS1PC,Bill,5,My wife and I both love Dallas. We've watched the show since its inception in 1978. There is always something unexpected!
B00IMYS1PC,Cyn,5,If you liked the old Dallas then you will love the updated version of this. The writers are brilliant without compromising the original. Little nuisances in both set and script keeps your dedication to the original. Can't wait each week for the next one.
B00IMYS1PC,Evelyn M. Garner "whitehead",4,A sexy raw story.. if you like such then this is for you.
B00IMYS1PC,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Great season.  Lots of plot twist.....maybe too many. But nicely done great job tying the death of Larry Hagman into the season. He will be missed but the legacy lives on.
B00IMYS1PC,Lizs Home Made,5,I was an original Dallas fan. This show has been filled with ups and downs. I am waiting on the next episode. I highly recommend this show.
B00IMYS1PC,Megan,5,The drama definitely pulls you in and from episode 1 your hooked! You start to like one person and then they become bad or vice versa! Definitely not predictable!
B00IMYS1PC,St Johns,5,Was a fan of several series in the 80's Dallas being one of them.  Enjoy the new cast and this last episode was a nail bitter.  Can hardly wait for the outcome next week.  Thanks for keeping the storyline intriguing.  Have one great idea for a future storyline but no idea whom to write to.  Will see if I can find an address online.  Thanks to all involved with this show.
B00IOGX55O,Amazon Customer "Computer DOC",5,Excellent documentary on the subject of WWII. Highly recommended series.
B00IOGX55O,David Seaquist,5,I am enjoying the series. I enjoy history and learning more about historical events. I am learning more about leaders of WWII
B00IOGX55O,Max Mustang,3,Shallow Bio's to much WWII revisionist histrionics. Lot'a old footage seen a 1000 times.  Not a scholarly epic.
B00IP45FAI,Michael Cooper,1,Really bad. Couldn't get past first few minutes.
B00IP45FAI,Patti V,4,This homegrown documentary is surprisingly intelligent and gives a little more historical leverage to the state's famous occupant.  You can spend your time in a less beneficial way.
B00IPQAQGE,Amazon Customer,3,It will be interesting to see where this show goes and how this family will cope with it's move. I will watch more.
B00IQ3XNLQ,A. Johnson "surfwood4",2,The show is diverting and interesting but seriously too light weight. Viewers are capable of dealing with much more depth than the show provides. A Brit would say the host is too cheeky for the subject matter!
B00IQ3XNLQ,Consumer 45,2,Different type of a way to introduce the subject at hand. Because of this I stayed to watch this episode but after got tired of the host being too intrusive that he started being the target of interest instead of the main subject.One episode was all I could take. The subject matter though was very interesting.Video quality awesome  Thanks Amazon!
B00IQ3XNLQ,dokolady "dokolady",4,Fun and basic education about Biblical archaeology.  The archaeologist-narrator adds a lot of humor and quirkiness to his colorful presentation.
B00IQ3XNLQ,D. P. Lance,3,The show does remove the  veil from the sites in the holy land. I saw a couple of episodes when this was first run. But I missed more then I saw so it was nice to see it was available. Please way to spend half an hour.
B00IQ3XNLQ,Katharine S. Dupre "Writer & Book Lover",5,It's nice to see a program that actually provides interesting information instead of the usual blather type programs we usually see.
B00IQ3XNLQ,Mary L. Everett "dressage lover",2,The subject matter is fascinating but the series narrator and travel guide is not.  His goal seems to be to prove that parts of the Bible are literally true in an historical sense.  This is fine but he isn't.
B00IQ3XNLQ,Thanks I Needed That,5,The guy is really interesting to watch.  He has a real thirst for knowledge and truth.  A great educational experience.
B00IQ3XNLQ,Vic Graninger,5,This show makes Archaeology fun.Simcha Jacobovici makes history fun and interesting - he is excited about biblical history and pulls his audience into the fray keeping things simple but not speaking down to his audience. He does not offend any particular people or religion. Mr. Jacobovici presents facts and evidence and allows the viewer to make his or her own decision based on the evidence.This is a very well done series. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this series and would recommend it to anyone.
B00IR6IB1E,Bill,5,The first episode was full of action and drama. The characters are well cast with some surprising plot twists. It's good to see Gillian Anderson in a new role.
B00IR6IB1E,Denn,1,Too many sharks jumped in first three episodes
B00IR6IB1E,Ellen Ellis,5,love gillian anderson in this role. The actress who plays her sister is a very good actress. believable. I hope this series stay on the air
B00IR6IB1E,Evelyn,5,This show started out with a big bang.  I could not stop watching it on Roku (I did not get to see the first few shows when they came on TV).  I hope the network keeps it going.
B00IR6IB1E,JJ,5,I am hooked right away!  This is in the same vain as 24!  Need to see how they develop the story line more!  Not to brutal yet!  I would not recommend this for people below the age of 16.
B00IRKCMHO,DebbieT,5,An absolutely amazing story! The actors are perfect in their roles! The story line of the movie is sooo tender and heartfelt.
B00IRKCMHO,Luv2learn "Sandy P",5,I was instantly drawn into the sweeping beauty of this movie.  The characters were well developed and evoked passion for them.  It made me want to read the book which doesn't often happen after a movie.
B00IRKCMHO,PhilDub,5,I really enjoyed this flick.  The characters and setting were all great.  Very interesting time period as there were some seriously crazy things taking place around the early WW2 era.
B00IRXIKA4,Michael Cooper,1,I don't know what the muck these people were thinking when the funded this movie. What a bunch of muckups!
B00IS8Q5HS,Amazon Customer,4,I have liked this show for a long time. This is a wonderful family show. I am impressed how they continually face obstacles and remain optimistic and caring towards each other.
B00IS8Q5HS,C.S.,5,We have been a fan of this series from day one.  I missed a couple of episodes and was catching up.
B00IS8Q5HS,Katherine Young,5,This family is the only reality show family worth watching. It isn't a zoo with ridiculous made up problems. It is real life with real challenges and they handle everything with love and strength.
B00ISC7LQS,By Ericka C.,5,Can't wait to see what happens this season after watching this.OMG!This is gonna be a crazy exciting season to watch
B00ISC7LQS,Carla tamari,1,Boring sad women some need meds and others ( turtle time) had plenty.  By the way Mario is a supercilious snake who ain't all that and a bag of chips.  Thank you for the vent  Carla Tamari
B00ISC7LQS,dana wallace,5,Heather can sing too???  What can't she do!  Send Ramona to the loony bin...
B00IT34WC2,alfredofranco,5,we need more shows like this
B00IT34WC2,barbw,5,And as usual it seems like most SciFy that I like just keeps getting cancelled live Believe.  They are also cancelling Revolution.  Another great SciFy show nbc had that was cancelled after one season was The Event.  So sad for this show to get cancelled when it barely got started. :(
B00IT34WC2,B. Slack,2,Pros:Acting and filming were ok.Some of the plot points were ok - who doesn't like extra-normal abilities?Cons:Girl was annoying and her actions would get people killed.Show also has a definite naive pacifistic slant - which is a major negative. One of the characters actually says &#34;We're good guys so we don't use guns.&#34; Oh please! Real good guys use what's necessary to protect the innocent.The whole &#34;save the musician/writer/poet because their words will change the world&#34;  thing has been done to death.Might watch another episode or two but not many more if it keeps the same direction.
B00IT34WC2,carrie,5,I AM NOT SURE ITS COOL DON'T LIKE BACK AND FORTH BULL CRAP BUT FEW BACK STORIES I NEED ALL INFO I LOSE INTRIST BUT IF SOAP WHAT WANT I GO WATCH THEM AMAZING DAD DAUGHTER TEAM EVER
B00IT34WC2,Michael "KarateMike",5,ORIGINAL PREMISE GOOD IDEA THAT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED THROUGHOUT THE SEASON IT STARTS OFF SLOW BUT HOOKS YOU RIGHT AWAY
B00IT34WC2,Rev.Carolyn J. White,2,I have just seen to much about this subject.  I just was not interested in keeping up a weekly show about this subject
B00IT34WC2,Robert J. Quigley "specs",4,Like the series but not quick enough to catch the pilot on Instant video before it became a price tag.
B00IT34WC2,Ruth in Salt Lake City,3,Good action scenes. Acting suffers as does scripts. It reminds me of Highway to Heaven...without the religion context. The girl bumps into people who &#34;need&#34; her help in some desperate fashion as she moves from not so safe house to not so safe house....
B00ITKS65Y,Virginia,4,Excellent acting and cleverly written.  Don't be put off by the title.  I will definitely be watching Nymphomaniac:  Volume two from Amazon. I highly recommend this movie.
B00IUX32OU,aidan pryde,1,One of the worst efforts at a new series I have ever seen. Don't spend a cent on this crap.
B00IUX32OU,Bill,5,I have watched the first three shows thus far and have found the writing and dialog to be very good. If you like &#34;Falling Skies&#34; you will like this show as well.
B00IUX32OU,Cathy Hinds,5,It gets better each show.  Worth watching lets hope they keep it on. Can't wait for season 2 this fall
B00IUX32OU,ccc,4,will continue to watch it and find out it its worth watching . like it so far. found it by accident.
B00IUX32OU,Denn,2,Ten bodice ripper
B00IUX32OU,D. Smith "Global Nomad",5,This TV series had me hooked and had to watch everyone.. I hope this will continue for sometime. If you like space/post apocalyptic tv shows this one is for you. Keeps you guessing who will make it.
B00IUX32OU,Ellie,2,I didn't think the acting was very good.  I wouldn't recommend this series to my family or friends.  Story too typical.
B00IUX32OU,Folina Peppercorn Dubernol,1,The overall premise of the story is good. The fact that the only people sent down are teenagers? Please. The whole thing is dreadful.
B00IUX32OU,Glenn H. Duncan,3,Now sure if I really will continue this series it is a bit immature for a adult audience. This is typical for the networks programming they took a good idea and messed it up. Unlike pure Science Fiction they had to add their political and environmental views to the story line I am sure the book is probably better. I will give it a few more episodes and then decide if I will continue. So far not impressed.
B00IUX32OU,Jeffery H,5,I really enjoyed the first season. I like the storyline. Can't wait for season 2. Its good to see some new sci-fi .
B00IUX32OU,KMaggi3,4,This show certainly has potential.  I hope that the CW will renew it for next season!  It's got some really good up-and-coming actors.  I'm anxious to see where this show will take us.
B00IUX32OU,Larry Baker,5,As Apocalyptic  stories go this one looks promising.  I think this would be an interesting series to follow.  I am interested in the story line.
B00IUX32OU,Mgriffin2312,5,Really enjoyed this new show! Looking forward to more seasons!
B00IUX32OU,michele symonette,1,too much lord of the flies doesn't sound interesting at all!  definitely not my type of show at all too depressing.
B00IUX32OU,pegeen,5,I haven't read the books but I really apprecite the attention to detail the series is becoming involved  with.  I will continue to watch season two.
B00IUX32OU,S. Fox "oyee",4,A bit too contrived to appeal to the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Dawson's Creek&#34; crowd but it redeemed itself occasionally.  I was entertained.
B00IUX32OU,Sharon  Williams,5,Great show!!
B00IUX32OU,vich,3,I like a fantasy as much as the next guy but this leans way onto the &#34;contrived&#34; and &#34;doesn't add up&#34; side.This show is destined to be cancelled and the fans left hanging.Check your reality scale at the door and it'll make for passable entertainment.
B00IUX32OU,Victor Nettle "Dr Vic",3,The 100: The Complete First Season is a gritty version of a possible future. Hard choices must be made and mistakes ensue.An evil character or two add conflict. I watch it.
B00IUX32OU,William Hodges,5,The show was a bit of a slow starter for me but once it got going I found the shows to be interesting and I am looking forward to next season
B00IVMTL9K,Amazon Customer,4,This is a very compelling story so far.  I am looking forward to watching the rest of the season and finding out how this has happened.
B00IVMTL9K,beth holman,5,First couple of shows were good then they got to be the same. Never explaining or finding the person who helped them.
B00IVMTL9K,Deborah Robinson,3,Only two episodes in it  is interesting.  I really don't have high expectations of network television but this could be an interesting concept with  good writing just have to hold out and see.
B00IVMTL9K,Pet Wisdom,4,I am very picky when it comes to scripted television. This is such a great series. It is suspenseful and every episode leaves viewers wondering what will happen next.
B00IVMTL9K,Rev.Carolyn J. White,4,This is a very interesting subject to me as I lost a two year old daughter.  I've been taping it every week.  I would like to be able to figure out more about why this is happening in fact I think it is getting somewhat boring because I don't know why this is happening.
B00IVMTL9K,S. Gonzales "PoleCat",5,I've only seen the first episode and I'm hooked... Looks to be a very good show..  Get hooked with my.. a must see
B00IVQ3ZH0,John C,5,She has a great way of comforting people after they experience the loss of a loved one.  She's very down to Earth.  Many people have accused her of being fake but I don't think so.  It seems very genuine to me.  She's got a great ability.  I am happy she's successful!
B00IVQ3ZH0,Karen,5,This show is amazing. I cry almost through every episode. I love seeing the joy and relief she brings to peoples lives. I have really changed my opinion and believe she is authentic! You go girl!!
B00IWLJD4I,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",4,It was a decent movie. It wasn't the best thing I ever saw. But it was good and gives you a good look into the world of alcohlism and children who live with alcoholic. It shows a system who sits by and let things happen because they can't do anything without physical proof. Granted the girls could have taken a different route but I understood why they did what they did. It's not something I would rush out to see but it's totally watchable movie. And it is good for anyone who does like Lifetime Movie Network type movies.
B00IWLJD4I,mistic,5,Crazy insane movie like wth! I cried in this dog gone movie wow poor girls the ending was a bit over freaking dramatic like ok now we get it ............ its a sad scene... but damn. Anywho's i cried like a baby in the end i aint even gonna lie honey! i cried i was like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh lord oooooh noooooooooo ohhhh jesus! lol
B00IYH8UEY,norma jean kringer,5,I was so impressed.  I was worried it would end up in the pile of SyFy garbage but I took a chance and it was brilliant.  I was at the edge of my seat to the very end.  Great entertainment.
B00IYXFDL6,robert robinson,2,This catoon has to much rambling about nothing and it needed more constriction on the heist. The value of the statue should have been made known from the start and who or what organization was behind it and why. The daughter was not polite in calling her father a wiedo. Good luck!
B00IYXFDL6,Thomas,1,You need to use the type of CGG that &#34;Archer&#34; uses rather than this stiff cartoonish animation. I could not watch past the first 5 minutes.The story is just too ho-hum. I would never even stream the thing let alone go to a theatre to view. Sorry. Try again.
B00J002TKA,Debrina Maria "Debrina",4,Definitely worth watching. I'm very surprised that I haven't seen this movie advertised or heard about before. Thank you Amazon.com for having this movie and lots of other awesome movies that no one else has now or ever will have. And to the director and writer of this movie cuddo's to you all involved in the film making. Very good and you could see this happening. MEAN WORLD OUT THERE.
B00J002TKA,helena,2,I ordered it by mistake. So I did not watch it. I don't like horror type movies. To each his own I guess.
B00J002TKA,Suzanne Schumacher "nocht2late",5,What a creepy movie.  I was so wide eyed throughout this entire thing I don't think I was breathing. Great
B00J5LHY72,Matein Movies,5,This movies is hilarious I have yet to stop laughing. I love the story line at last a true interpretation of our other brain. The romance was good too.A must watch for men
B00J5LHY72,Peter Morrison "Love reading.",3,Kinda cute.
B00J5SGZUM,Alex,5,I would like to see more seasons of this show. I enjoyed it a lot. It's about as good if not better than Face Off.
B00J5SGZUM,Amy,5,A great new show. Love seeing how the creatures are made.Can't wait to see what else the create. This is a fun show and great for the whole family.
B00J5SGZUM,DemonessOfDeathValley,5,I love special effects makeup and I've always loved Jim Henson creations. In the age of CGI (when it's used as a crutch) I'm so glad to see that there are still people interested in this kind of special effect.
B00J5SGZUM,Katherine Young,5,The best part about the show is getting to see all the work it takes to bring life into a creature that started as nothing.
B00J5SGZUM,Timothy Black,5,This is an excellent show! Anyone that is a fan of Jim Henson will love this show! I would recommend anyone that likes special effect in movies and TV shows to watch it!
B00J5TCASC,1443giggles,5,After the 4th season I wasn't sure if I would still like the show but I still love it and the 5th and now the 6th season have both been really good.  I even rewatch the earlier seasons because it is such a great show.
B00J5TCASC,Barbara,5,I love this story line.  The actors portrait really smart legal mines and makes you think about various legal problems.
B00J5TCASC,Carolyn,5,Great Series! I love it!  It was temporarily canceled in season 4 but liked so much they brought it back for a 5th. Season 6 just started. I just recently learned that this will be the last season. :(..... (Unless they can be talked into bringing it back again)
B00J5TCASC,Lee H.,5,I absolutely love Drop Dead Diva!!
B00J5TCASC,THOMPSON,5,CURRENTLY VIEWING SEASON SIX. VERY GOOD EPISODES SOO FAR.
B00J5TCASC,William Hodges,5,This is a fun show with so many twists and turns it stays entertaining all season because you never know what to expect.
B00J5U9SIQ,AUBREYGAMMON3,5,My WIFE And I Love That MOVIE It Was A True Story About 1776 That Before We Was Born. IT Was Good Movie.
B00J5U9SIQ,Denn,3,Better than most bodice rippers
B00J5U9SIQ,E. Best,5,Outstanding dramatization of America's First Spy Network.  Acting first rate.  Don't start watching if you're not prepared to be hooked and want to see it all!
B00J5U9SIQ,Helen Thomas,5,I am watching the development of the story line and the characters.  Wonderful concept.  It peaks interest in American history.
B00J5U9SIQ,Kisa,3,It is visually covert but not covert in the way we think of &#34;intelligence&#34; so its hard to understand and I lose interest quickly! The acting is really good but I'm not captivated at all because everyone is everyone's enemy. There is no structure between parties. Thinking that the creator made this concept up without enough thought put into it.
B00J5U9SIQ,Olethes A. Hodges,5,I love this series thus far...intriguing and the suspense is a slow climax to our nation history. You know it's a good show when you haven't seen it in weeks and can't stop wonder what going to happen. I recommend this to everyone young and old...enjoy!
B00J5U9SIQ,Sam Rashid,5,Very well portrayed and acted with respect to the American Revolution.  Amazing how people forget the apathy during the time of the Revolution by many Americans who felt that they didn't need their Independence from Britain.
B00J5U9SIQ,S. Marsh,2,I had thought this would be a great story and series to watch. After watching the preview I have no interest in this show.
B00J5WENJS,Bacon,4,i can't see how this is going to end but so far its going ok. Mad Men is getting a bit boring though and I don't like that they are making the final season 2 parts.
B00J5WENJS,C. Roderick,5,Fine first episode&#8230;Don more self-aware&#8230;insurance agency tense&#8230;women facing an uphill battle for recognition&#8230;.well-done&#8230;.It left me looking forward to the next installment&#8230;.
B00J5WENJS,dana wall,3,This season sucks! How fun is it to watch Don Draper not at the top of his game. He just seems so pitiful this season and it just doesn't fit with the character's cockiness! I'm hating it.
B00J5WENJS,Helen E. Dowd "HD",4,I know I am going to enjoy every minute. I can't believe it will be gone next year. I look forward every week to the next episode. So well written and such good actors. I have to have my Mad Men every week. Someday I many watch the whole thing all over again.
B00J5WENJS,JH,5,It's just too good to deal with those irritating commercial breaks. Worth the investment and then it's always available in my video library
B00J5WENJS,J. Walsh "Happy Mom",5,Just as fun and fast moving as all the other seasons!  I'm so addicted to this show and I'll be sad to see it go.
B00J5WENJS,Kate "OhNo",5,Got this one for my cousin....Wow!  Wow!
B00J5WENJS,Liz Hart,5,Mad Men...the best
B00J5WENJS,Martin,1,Almost unwatchable...there were 11 reloads in final 30 minutes ranging from 43 seconds  to over a minute ( Yes- we started timing them). Too many copies were probably sold. It would have been better with commercials.
B00J5WENJS,Norman,5,I have been unable to catch this series when it airs on TV.Exceptionally happy it is available via Amazon Prim!. No commercials; excellent quality; WELL worth the reasonable price.
B00J5WENJS,Sandra E. Chatelain,5,Story of Don's decline is compelling and the writing top notch as it has been throughout the series.  Fascinating train wreck.
B00J5WENJS,Shannon J.,3,I hope the final season has some more gritty drama. Last year's season was so so. It was a dull beginning.
B00J7UV274,Alex,5,The 'science' in 'science fiction' got cranked up quite a bit in this season. Pay real close attention because the complexity of the story has increased in this season.
B00J7UV274,Aliza M. Beer "Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,5,I'm a big fan of this series and I was really excited to hear that it was coming back. I can't wait to see what awaits.
B00J7UV274,Dan Weddle,3,Doesn't maintain the suspense and continuity of the first system.  Seems to be bogging down and loosing direction. That's it.
B00J7UV274,David S. Cowan,3,The plot thickens..  More unexpected twists and turns.  Turning the tables on major characters and re-understanding their motivations - the bad guys become heroes and the good guys lackeys to the corporate machine.  Really deepening the character development.  And all the weird time travel consequences...  Well written.  Not Great!  But Good!  The story has become so much more complex as the seasons developed.  The strategic use of flashbacks and flash-forwards makes the story-line richer.
B00J7UV274,gerry d lay,5,the series gives a view at one possible future for us and i for one enjoy the complexity and downright humanity of the characters and storyline
B00J7UV274,jimmarx,5,It has a great cast of characters and relationships.  The story and writing has some intense time travel concepts that keep you guessing.  Love it!
B00J7UV274,JV,5,Great show and I am glad to see season three finally here It was about time been waiting a while keep them coming.
B00J7UV274,Kent C Christen,4,It is a little too politically correct but the story is interesting and is worth the time to watch.  Kera's conversion to an independent thinking individual is fun to watch.
B00J7UV274,Lil'Dove,5,Wow! Love the cliff hangers. Can't wait to see where it all leads. Hope this is not the last episode or end of series.
B00J7UV274,Manuel De La Paz,4,Not as exciting as some but I enjoy the story line.  It does make you think about the possibilities.  I would recommend it.  Though there are some out there that best this series.  This is a interesting addition to scifi tv.
B00J7UV274,Melanie,1,Not very interesting
B00J7UV274,R. Hartley "Writer's Mind",5,I really enjoy this show. For me it is a great sci-fi show that handles the time travel genre very well. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good science fiction.
B00J7UV274,S. Fox "oyee",5,What's not to love?  Best sci-fi *ever* on TV .
B00J8CFQ2S,cynthia,5,My friend and I watched these together.  It is very interesting how they solve these cases.
B00J8CFQ2S,Deanna R Taylor,3,This series is an old one.  It is interesting and wish the TV shows of today were more like it in that it doesn't take so long to tell a story.
B00J8CFQ2S,Joyce A Campbell,5,This program shows how persistent people can be to reach the truth that also can be hard to find opening doors that need to be opened.  Now people don't get away with crimes that they would have several years ago.
B00J8CFQ2S,Kindle Customer,2,Just not my type of show.
B00J8CFQ2S,Sandra Martinez,4,This show is awesome!! I have always loved forensics & wanted a career in this field...definitly would recommend this show
B00J8CFQ2S,W. P. Emil,5,Great real life crime stories telling how intricate the crime detective field is.  Fascinating to see and learn how difficult some cases can be.
B00JBHQ138,Boulder Mike,4,This is quite entertaining..not exactly the Art of filmmalkng - but a great comedy with a somewhat hot main actress. Very good light entertainment. A little &#34;Kafkaesque&#34;...could happen to anybody..
B00JBHQ138,Day Fan,5,Pretty funny overall.
B00JBHQ138,Kelly,5,Loved it~ Very funny. Great acting by Elizabeth Banks as usually. Definitely recommend ordering if you are in the mood for a comedy.
B00JBHQ138,NC. movie man,4,I did enjoy this movie very funny but glad I rented. If you like Banks you will love it. Didn't care much for the ending but that just me. Don't let that stop you.
B00JBHQ138,Peter Morrison "Love reading.",3,so so
B00JBHQ138,Richard "Fun_to_know",5,I enjoyed every minute of this movie and laughed out loud many times. The highest compliment I can pay is I converted from rental to own!!
B00JBHQ138,Robert S Zoller,4,A truly funny and entertaining movie. Made me laugh out loud several times. Elizabeth Banks is drop dead gorgeous and showed she is a talented actress aslo
B00JBHQ138,txjaywalker,3,This movie was mildly entertaining - I honestly don't even remember much of the storyline.  I do remember thinking the story was predictable and mindless.  This is a movie you won't miss if you choose not to watch it.
B00JBNX59U,Blanda Lynam,5,Even though it had subtitles I watched the whole season and would love to have more.  Well written show too bad there was only one season.
B00JBNX59U,David W. Meadows,4,excellent series and well written well acted and believable/even though I would prefer English and not subtitles once I started watching I had to finish the entire series and would watch the next series if available
B00JBNX59U,E J Peak,4,When you see crimes committed against the backdrop of beautiful Sweden with everyone in them blond and beautiful you'd think you were in a surreal version of Clockwork Orange. The understated acting goes with the national temperament I suppose but it leaves you wanting more.
B00JBNX59U,Elaine Gowder,4,This series presented some very creative ways that people were murdered.  I was impressed.  Eva Rose portraying Maria Wern is very beautiful and she was always present to the audience to allow her  beauty to be appreciate her.  Having the series in Sweden was so great.  The English subtitles were not a distraction.  I enjoyed the challenge of reading the subtitles and following the story line.
B00JBNX59U,Lizzie,5,I prefer a lot of mental involvement in detective programs and this one does it for me; also enjoy various locations!
B00JBNX59U,Lynn "Bashira",5,I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Please make more of the Scandinavian tv series available for prime members on instant video streaming.
B00JBNX59U,Marion M. Giuffria "Marion6",1,I was unable to look mat it as it kept popping out.  It is not possible to rate this video.
B00JBNX59U,Mike von R,5,It is very interesting to see how the police and the justice systems work together in another &#34;western&#34; country.  It is also a pleasure to observe really good acting by all of the characters.
B00JBNX59U,Roger E. Ervast,4,I like the foreign versions of mystery and crime shows.  I guess it started with the Steig Larson trilogy first reading them and then watching the foreign language as well the English versions of the movie.
B00JBNX59U,salt94,3,Enjoyed shows but little over the top (Maria riding bus with teacher who kills himself when he gets off of and the same bus runs over girl also involved in story).
B00JBNX59U,S. M. Lott "MovieMusic",4,good stories with the opportunity to guess the villianto bad the episodes are not dubbed....just subtitled.  I have to be prepared to read through the whole thing...not always able to do that.
B00JBNX59U,Timothy J. Gannon,5,Brings forward the difficulty of a well rounded life in a complex high demand field. There is a calmness that surrounds the sound and ploddig police work of this series.
B00JBNX59U,Wiliam Myers,4,Thoroughly enjoy this series - even with the English subtitles --- would be nice if in English - but...at any rate --- good series - good plots and personal interaction.
B00JFQ96F0,Cward55,2,Ya this movie started off ok but then slowly declined into a crappy horror movie with some music thrown in. Pretty much the same songs are  just used over and over again throughout the movie and are not clever at all. Acting is ok but nothing special. The killer was kinda cool but even that annoying after awhile. I wouldn't recommend this at all.
B00JGMJ914,Catherine,4,A demonstration on how real life is a lot more subtle and disturbing at the same time. I don't think a lot of people have a grasp of reality at all
B00JGMJ914,pd,1,&#34; Morris also creates commercials to support liberal candidates and causes. &#34; About.com biography.  Just another Michael Moore that is trying to paint a picture of Republicans as evil boogey men.  I turned off after about half since it is obviously not an impartial evaluation of Donald Rumsfeld. I am not a Bush fan but all the five stars above must be Obama voters getting just what they expected from this guy.
B00JGMJ914,thehorrorwithin,1,I'm a huge Errol Morris fan.  Making good documentaries takes serious courage but when the subject of your film is an infamous  question dodger you better be prepared to ask tough questions and push him for real answers.  This film leads you don't a rabbit hole to nowhere.  I'm pissed that Morris allows Rumsfeld to smile mockingly at the camera for an hour and say absolutely nothing of consequence.  I rented a curtain reveal but instead of a brand new car I wound up with the 1970's vacuum.  Thanks a lot Jim.
B00JGMK50S,C. conway,3,So I have seen just about every behind the camera genre films .This one is not as good as some but it has its good moments .Its very intense at parts but not so far as for me to call this little film a horror movie .I suggest if u are a fan of this type genre film making then you should check it out .sorry I don't do spoilers I feel it takes away from the imagination Of the viewer .ENJOY&#128522;
B00JGMK6VG,David "Black Widow 2014",5,this movie is awesome. better than the first one. winter soldier was awesome he kicked butt. he was the best villain in a marvel movie in a long time. the story was awesome the action was awesome and so was the special effects. I'm glad that they put winter soldier as the bad guy in this movie. and if anyone did not notice that they mentioned doctor strange in the movie which was cool and it was cool that they had falcon in the movie. which is another avenger in the comics. all in all this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00JGMK6VG,MISTER SJEM "sonofhotpie",4,A bit better than the first and something of a treat for the graphic novel fans. Like most Marvel movies it's easy to get lost in the action over the story and characters but this one does a better job. A lot of fun but far from perfect for film snobs. Kudos to Black Widow trying to set Cap up with Sharon Carter (another nod to the graphic novels).
B00JGN11DM,mistic,5,This was a crazy funny insane movie i laughed so damn hard.... But i did take notes hahahah. Realy kool funny flick. Hilarious.
B00JH1IDDY,Amazon Customer,5,This is an outstanding show!!!  This is an absolute must watch!  Syfy has do it yet again! WATCH IT PEOPLE!
B00JH1IDDY,Bill,5,If you're a fan of the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; or &#34;American Horror Story: Coven&#34; you'll like this! Good plots and a lot of familiar actors.
B00JH1IDDY,C. Hill,4,I used to love reading about the Salem witch trials when I was a little girl.  This spin on them is quite gory and rather scary but really interesting and I cannot help but compare it with historical perspectives.
B00JH1IDDY,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,Great show
B00JH1IDDY,D. K. Peel "jstkdn",4,very interesting but the plot gets lost every once in a while
B00JH1IDDY,Kelly,1,This stinkeroo is so blatantly bad it will make your teeth hurt.It is incredibly disrespectful to women. It makes no attempt to be historically accurate. WGN should be ashamed to be associated with this project!
B00JH1IDDY,L. John,4,At first I decided this was too creepy and I'm not interested in creepy stuff...but then I had to watch another episode...and then another to see what happens next...and now I'm hooked...waiting waiting waiting each week for the next installment of the story.
B00JH1IDDY,Marti Ellis,5,Found the pilot to be all I expected it to be and more. Liked seeing the charactures well defined from the beginning and the story line fantastic but believe able! Special effects were awesome.
B00JH1IDDY,Nena,4,I am intrigued by the olden days of witchcraft and Salem let's me into that world. The special effects are great and the characters are interesting.
B00JH3S0AI,C. D. Simmons "Doug Simmons-Old Timer",5,Sounds like one of her better efforts.
B00JIL4HLA,Adam Rutledge,5,Was so sad to see the original 24 series go away and this comes in where the original ended. Same suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole season.
B00JIL4HLA,Anubis,5,24 Season 9 is great and cannot wait for season 10 if they plan on doing it.
B00JIL4HLA,Bertha Scoggins,5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I enjoyed 24 years ago and again they brought back 24 and it is great. I like the new actors they added and enjoyed the fast pace the had during the 24 hour period. More...
B00JIL4HLA,Chris D. Kepford "huh?",5,yay so great unbelievable so very happy i like it hell i love it hell its great  and wowee woohoo
B00JIL4HLA,Deb,5,Big Jack Bauer Fans.
B00JIL4HLA,D. Robertson,5,I loved the original 24 and this has all the same elements and even with the change in format it doesn't seem to have lost anything
B00JIL4HLA,Janet Atkinson - Q15J,5,The London setting adds a nice touch - the villain is truly villanous and the action and uncertainty keep you engaged.
B00JIL4HLA,John,5,I was hoping the new 24 would pick up where it left off.  I was not disappointed.  Same suspence and anticipation until next week.  although a bit older (who isn't)  Baur does not disappoint.  Glad to see Chloe is back as well - they make a great team.
B00JIL4HLA,Kent C Christen,5,If you liked the show in the past you will not be disappointed about the renewal of the series.  I hope they keep the series going next year for another season.I do like the 12 hour format better than the 24 approach.
B00JIL4HLA,kevin brown "mopar",5,Just as good as the first one. I would say better but that would be seriously impossible.Go Jack.Oh and Chloe
B00JIL4HLA,L. Carlson "lovemykindle",5,I love 24 live another day! It really keeps along with the original 24! I was at the edge of my seat the whole time!
B00JIL4HLA,Linda Adams,4,I continue to watch each year.  I enjoy Keith Sutherland and all the cast.
B00JIL4HLA,Linda K. Holman,5,This has been a constant entertaining series.  It has been an exciting and action packed series to watch.  I look forward to it every week.
B00JIL4HLA,megb "megb",4,True to itself. This season followed the 24 formula all the way and did not disappoint this fan. I'm hoping for more seasons to come.
B00JIL4HLA,miasarx,5,We're only up to episode 8 but WE LOVE 24. WE LOVE JACK BAUER. We love the thought of a guy who will do whatever it takes to stop terrible things happening to America.
B00JIL4HLA,myview,5,It's great to have Jack back!!  Even if it is for only 12 weeks. 24 was one of the very few good drama series on television in recent years.  So bringing it back for even a short time is a breath of fresh air.  The actors are excellent and the plot brings me back each week.
B00JIL4HLA,Nancy Barrett,5,I never watched 24 when it was on FOX. I love Kiefer Sutherland so I watched all episodes on Amazon and I was hooked. So having these latest episodes is a thrill
B00JIL4HLA,Nancy Sutherlin,5,As usual one stays on the edge of their chair.  The 24 series is a wonderful experience.  Glad more is coming
B00JIL4HLA,Ronald W. Pramshcufer,5,Wow.... is all I can say to describe the first 2 hour episode of Season 9. Going into it I wasn't sure how the location change to London would work.... it worked great!!  Jack with tatts and a darker Chloe..... double wow..
B00JIL4HLA,Roy E. Oetting,5,President Heller is a great President but he needs a haircut. If he runs for the real President I'll vote for him. Maybe Jack could be the VP. Great series so far. I'd also like to say that everyone is doing a great job of acting. Never been to London but if I were rich I'd definitely take in the sites.
B00JIL4HLA,Terry smith,4,Just when I thought they were all dead. Jack returns like never before and BAM!!!Did Cloe ever look different; she is kind of way out there.Next episodes should be the determining factor if the renewed series will make it or not.
B00JIL4HLA,Thomas Condon "Film boomer",4,I love 24 but this miniseries left me wanting more. There is a wonderful backstory but this one left me wanting.
B00JIL4HLA,W. Prentice,5,Exciting action and an honest to goodness American hero you can enjoy!
B00JKOAOMQ,Bookworm4,3,Just wondering as usually it's $1.89 an episode if one subscribes to the TV Pass. Is this another perk being taken away?
B00JKOAOMQ,Linda Adams,2,Over the years it has changed a lot and often I find some of the things said a bit trashy.
B00JMJOWXG,Al Mellon,5,missed some and just ordered it and she was happy and a happy wife is a happy life.  Prime is great
B00JMJOWXG,Amazon Customer,5,F2F does it again. Great show from a network that along with AMC offers some of the best shows on basic cable.  Fargo is well worth the watch.
B00JMJOWXG,Denn,5,as good or better than the movie
B00JMJOWXG,Eleanor Weber,5,Going to be a great show. Love all the actors but I'm a big fan of Billy Bob. Look forward to season.
B00JMJOWXG,Happy Time,5,This show has managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.  The writing is exemplary.  The plot twists are what keep me glued to the set.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00JMJOWXG,Liz Hart,5,It took me a little time to enjoy this series...one show. The cast is amazing. Billy Bob Thornton plays a pretty scary character. If you've watched Breaking Bad or Dexter or 'End Game&#34; (Netflix) you will truly enjoy these amazing actors. This is my night life. I know so many people who are hooked. Fantastic by the Cohn Brothers.
B00JMJOWXG,L. John,4,Minnesota. Garrison Keeler had me convinced that nothing like this could ever happen there...and then I started watching Fargo. Now I can't stop watching.
B00JMJOWXG,Odell Hobbs,5,In the case of Fargo... One keeps wondering when the other shoe is a going to be drop......it does... and then there's a bigger shoe...... The show is twisted and exceptionally deceptive on the order of others-wise sweet and decent people co-mingling with the likes of murderous scum bags whose movements are being tracked by one whip smart but unappreciated female beat-cop who is suffering from a abundus ignoramus surroundus!!! She keeps llustrating her valid findings to people who should be listening but to not avail. The show is to say the least is interesting and some of the bad guys get it and it some of them don't....... And so goes Fargo.
B00JMJOWXG,samer kader,5,Superb...better than the film!
B00JMJOWXG,S. Fox "oyee",2,derivative but not in a good way.  Took all the goofy things from the movie ( right down to an Asian with a Minesotan accent ) and just replayed them.  Dumb.
B00JMJOWXG,Terrance L. Mcgowan,3,I thought the story would never get off the ground.  No definitive conclusion.  Lot of blood spilled and dead bodies seem to accumulate everywhere.
B00JMJOWXG,Thomas G Caulfield,3,It was good I guess I expected more but it was entertaining. I would recommend it but not strongly.  It was okay.
B00JP260B2,Diana L. Cain,5,I have been watching Deadliest Catch since Sig was a embryo - if you watched the show you'd get that. I missed their Wanted Dead Or Alive sound track but other than that it's still a good show.
B00JP260B2,Jamie Hensley,3,This season is lacking in the excitement of past seasons. No big storms and mellow seas make this season rather boring.
B00JP260B2,O. Vaughn "Movie Fan",5,We haven't missed a single season of this exciting show.  We love the family aspect and the challenges that the crew overcome. Great adventure!
B00JP260B2,pam,5,Have enjoyed since 1st season!
B00JP260B2,S. Thiel "Sanpan",5,This is one of my favorite programs.  I like being able to watch it on prime on my own schedule instead of trying to catch it on tv.  This is great!
B00JQ306BK,KES,3,This film was charming but I have read numerous books and research about this subject so did not find it as interesting as I had hoped. But for a first time introduction to near death experience I think it is an excellent production and viewers with no prior knowledge or experience of this subject matter would totally enjoy.
B00JQ306BK,miss tinkerbell,5,this movie was so awesome and really made you think seeing something through a child's eyes is the purest way to see it I loved this movie
B00JRSBG9U,FLOWERPOWERMD,5,I LOVE THIS SHOW  . THE ACTORS ARE GREAT I JUST WISH THAAMAZON PRIME STOPPED CHARGING ITS LOYAL PEOPLE FOR EPISODES IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IR SOME REWARDS PROGARM TO OFFER  BUY MORE GET MORE OR EARN REWARD S FR FREE SHOW S .. I AM CUT THE CORD AND DONT WANT HE BILL FOR  CABLE SHOWS TO GET PILED UP
B00JRSBG9U,Julie Murphy,5,So much fun to watch!
B00JRSBG9U,Le Magicien.,5,I really love this series. My sister once again recommended this series to check out and I did. I love it and I follow it. It is very funny and entertaining as well. I recommend this series!
B00JRSBG9U,Nena,5,Love this show. The story line is intriguing and the characters are lovable. I can't get enough of Devious Maids
B00JRSBG9U,THOMPSON,5,WHEN IS THE NEXT SEASON ARRIVING? MORE EPISODES  FOR THE SEASON PLEASE.
B00JRU8QGO,1farstar,3,Weird.  Gory.  I've seen worse films.
B00JRU8QGO,Marshaleigh,3,This was pretty interesting if nothing else than you cannot figure where they are going. This is a psych thriller from the get-go. There's some shock factor so expect anything. Acting is decent but the best thing is how the scenes are directed. I'm still scratching my head but it wasn't too bad.
B00JXCZIFI,The Movie Guy "Movies from A to Z",5,Kate (Leslie Mann) discovers her husband Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has been cheating on him with Carly (Cameron Diaz) and Amber (Kate Upton). The three women form a sisterhood making me feel like I was watching a &#34;Sex in the City&#34; episode. Together they conspire to &#34;hurt&#34; Mark.The movie is a chick flick. Cameron Diaz is not the spry Charlies' Angel anymore. Leslie Mann plays an unrealistic character that was fun to watch. And Kate Upton ran in slow motion in a white bikini. This was a fun formulaic film that is not deep. Good sound track helped in the enjoyment.Parental Guide: No nudity. 2 mouthed f-bombs. Sex talk
B00JXCZIFI,Twilight Mom,5,Missed it in theaters so I rented it and watched on my Kindle Fire HD...I will purchase this on DVD!
B00K0CD10Y,Anubis,5,Great new cop show with a twist.  Really hoping this gets a 2nd season.
B00K0CD10Y,TammyZ,4,It's really good.  The girl from Miami Vice who played Gina is also in this show.Good story line.  You have to like cop shows.
B00K1WIN7O,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",5,I loved this movie. It is typical Ti West in my opinion. His movie tend to be a bit of a slow burn some better than others. But this is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was very impressed. It was well done and the acting was stellar.
B00K2PN9JM,denmich1997,2,There was a lot of buzz about this movie on horror movie sites.  That it used practical effects and was a return to old school movie making.  But it's slow and just follows the standard isolated and trapped with a creature story.  The effects are minimal and the dubbing is bad.
B00K2PN9JM,some guy,1,Dubbed. Couldn't finish it.
B00K59EL6K,Chuck Bittner "Disabled comedian & gamer!",5,I'm a huge Louis CK fan and I've loved this show since season one. But I think this season he really went out of his way to prove that he can address so many facets of life on his own terms. The key to this season is don't go into it looking for laugh out loud moments but more those moments where you chuckle inside because what you see on the screen possibly will/did happen to you.If you don't know Louis has a deal with FX where he gets to make a show and they have no creative control over it he gives it to them and that's that. It really is the sweetest deal that any comedian/writer/actor has ever had. He can do whatever he wants and this season I think he really polished that idea.Some people call this season a very pretentious display by Louie to get on a soapbox about social issues. I don't see it that way I see it more in the vein that he wants to tell stories he perceives to have importance and truth to them. I don't love every episode of season four but I still respect his creative right to make it. In fact I'm glad that I don't like every episode because maybe I'm not supposed to.It's not always comedy in fact this season is very little comedy and more about the struggles we as humans face and how we face them. Most of the season of Louie each episode is a self-contained story with very little overreaching story arcs between them. This season is the same but a few of the episodes have a narrative that stretches between three or four episodes.Some people don't like what Louis has done with this season but what I appreciate is that he does what he wants to do. I think is a very insightful standup comedian but I also think that he's actually a very insightful filmmaker.Thanks for reading!
B00K59EL6K,Monica A. Sloan,1,Didn't care for this at all but clearly a matter of opinion.
B00K5M7LSC,Arish "A+",1,If you want to watch something more adventurous watch basic instinct. This is the same premise but without any bite too it very boring and slow. The girl is crazy but they draw it out and the shrink or whatever falls for her charm. Girl makes a fool out of the shrink and sets him up .
B00K5M7LSC,Melissa Robinson "Melissa",4,I decided to watch this after a friend recommended. And I really liked it a lot. I love the girl from American Horror Story she is such a great actress. It was great to see her on something more than that tv show. The movie was well done. I didn't get bored like I usually do. It was very entertaining and definitely worth the watch.
B00KBN95IE,biker boy 66 "biker boy",5,Great show. I like the actors and the way there is a plot within a plot. The ongoing drama that goes on every episode and the new plot for each episode. Great acting by all actors. A must see. I believe this is Lou Diamond Phillips best role of his career.
B00KBN95IE,David Murphy "Nalvage",5,Great show from the beginning and continues strong.All of the characters are perfectly cast.Love the Native American outlook.
B00KBN95IE,Denn,3,Starting to stretch too much
B00KBN95IE,Faith,4,It's a Western soap opera hidden in a beautiful Western setting. The acting is OK and the episodes are watchable for entertainment (better than a lot of them out there)
B00KBN95IE,K. Thomas,5,Great show. Sexy actors. Great plot. Must see. Your guy will enjoy it too. Hopefully will keep getting renewed. Excellent.
B00KBN95IE,MacGyver's "Swiss Army Knife",3,I like this show.  Would prefer more cowboy and less Indian mysticism.  The locations are great.  Scripts could be a little tighter and beefed up.
B00KBN95IE,MM,5,This has to be one of the best shows out. I stream all my viewing thru Amazon(no TV for me) and find they offer just the shows I want to watch. Always waiting for the next great episode.
B00KBN95IE,NormaJean James,5,Great series.
B00KBN95IE,Norman,5,Great series. So very glad it's available via Amazon. AND commercial fee.  Well worth the &#34;rental fee&#34;.
B00KBN95IE,Patrice L. Geathers "yenomden",1,All I got was a preview or interview of what the season was about. I didn't get to the third season at all. What's up with that?
B00KBN95IE,rsbinscarth,5,I really love this show.  It is a great different crime show with an &#34;out-west&#34; flare.  Great casting.  Robert Taylor is very easy on the eyes!!
B00KBN95IE,Ruth M. Capolino "scooter",5,just can't get enough of this series.  Love western themes. This Longmire isdone so so well!!
B00KBN95IE,S. Scarlett "Sam",5,modern take on a western sheriff&#8230;really quite well done given that it is just an hour long procedural.
B00KBN95IE,Susan "Susan",5,At last - images of today's real West on the American small screen again! Solid acting with story lines that keep you tuning in week after week. Don't miss it!
B00KBN95IE,t,5,It's an excellent show. Good story. Good characters. Good cast & crew. Love it.
B00KCXHNRS,Anthony J Perri,3,Somewhat of a disappointment ...I like the premise and the characters have potential but somehow the stories don't execute...I keep wanting it to be better
B00KCXHNRS,Fish,5,This is looking to be a top-notch caper series.  Lee Pace and Scoot McNairy are great.  The only false note in the story is the Camron Howe character which is a little too cliche riooooot giiiirrrlll (Priss from Blade Runner look a like) for me but Mackenzie Davis does a great job with what she is given.  I turned 10 in 1980 and grew up with the personal computer.  I can't wait to see what happens next.  Another solid AMC show that has a chance to become another Mad Men or Breaking Bad.
B00KCXHNRS,Peter Morrison "Love reading.",4,Interesting
B00KD9N9BA,ellison,3,Story of JB who is running a failing sports agent agency.  When a potential client falls through he is unable to make the payment on his office. While watching Susan Boyle sing in a contest and some guys playing a game of cricket he wonders if he can have a contest to find a pitcher.He goes to India and sets up 'The Million $ Arm' throwing contest.  He finds two guys that have a little talent.  He brings them back to the United States for six months of training to get a Major League tryout and possible contract.
B00KDMEHWW,Mike suell,5,Good show Jon is awesome
B00KDO42CU,alfredofranco,5,wash the show play the game. that's cool
B00KDO42CU,Aunt Hilda,5,Another of my current favorites!
B00KDO42CU,bob is dead,5,Very good show.
B00KDO42CU,Elliot Viker,4,Looks like people need to pay attention.  This season is taking some interesting twists. It looks like some of the people's true selves is showing.
B00KDO42CU,gerry d lay,5,Great so far the story is getting better every episode the characters are quite intriguing and the series overall gets an A+ from me
B00KDO42CU,Ruth in Salt Lake City,4,Improved writing from last season and the sets or CGI sets seem to have more depth/detail. I find it entertaining and engaging.
B00KDO42CU,Scott E. Bruneau,4,Yes I paid to see it. Good entertainment but writing seemed to be lacking unlike last year. Will continue. Still costs less to purchase a few series of TV on the net than to pay every month for cable. This is worth it I think. Interesting characters and some good action. Good sci fi is rare. This is rare.
B00KDO42CU,Terri H,5,i was on the edge of my seat
B00KEOOBUC,Route66Review,1,Whatever this lame flick is it's not a horror film.  It looks like a classic bait and switch game to get you to see the documentary that is this film.  I guess some directors  will do anything to get you to view their C Movie.  Not I.
B00KEOOBUC,Sadcelticlady,3,The film has some good moments . The story line is good . Acting is typical of the genre . Some comic scenes .A lot of blood & gore . But not bad .
B00KF7NNTI,happy,5,I can no longer see this series on airwave/cable gone so than you Amazon for making a way to watch this show. If you could only do this with the upcoming highlander Diana gabaldon series
B00KF7NNTI,Michael "KarateMike",5,UNBELIEVABLE THIRD SEASON IS OFF TO AN AMAZING START &#34;THE RUSTY MOM STUFF IS JUST TOP SHELF DRAMA &#34;i LOVE IT&#34;
B00KF7NNTI,SaraG,5,This is my favorite show!
B00KGUJUXC,Bacon,4,well... my wife watches this so idk how I am suppose to rate it. she continues to watch it so it must be good. 4 stars i guess
B00KGUJUXC,Kate "OhNo",5,Addicting!  My aughter got me interested in this show last year..had to watch from beginning to get caught up...very intriguing!
B00KGUJUXC,NormaJean James,3,I think this series has gone on too long.  Not very interesting anymore.
B00KGUJUXC,Tagsmom,4,These girls are so fun and look fashionable as their Scooby-Doing-It!  Its getting a little more intense in this season cause you dont know what Mona's going to do!
B00KGUJUXC,Tamara L Perez,5,Great mystery show with some romance.
B00KKGRT1W,Glenda Birdow,4,Great show.
B00KKGRT1W,Michael "KarateMike",5,WOW THIS SHOW JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER THE MAIN CHARACTERS GOOD AND BAD ARE TOP NOTCH  A GREAT SHOW I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
B00KKGRT1W,M. Kennedy,5,You want these two characters to capture the murderer (or the one whom you believe to be the villain) and wipe the smirk off his face.  They are clever and very human with lives full of very human foibles.
B00KKGRT1W,Nancy,5,Keeps me looking forward to the next episode.
B00KKGRT1W,Richard E. Moriarity "rikE2iis",5,great show---lots of storyline intermingled.
B00KKGRT1W,R. Miller,4,My wife and I really enjoy this series.
B00KKGS1KK,Adele M. Klima,5,I can hardly wait to see the next episode to find out how the Mason family escapes their captors to reunite tha family and continue the fight. Very disappointed in the Cochise factor though...perhaps he will redeem himself...
B00KKGS1KK,Amazon Customer,4,I really enjoy si-fi movies and shows. need more episodes please
B00KKGS1KK,Anubis,5,Season 4 is amazing though I do not want to catch up until all the episodes are released.
B00KKGS1KK,Bill,5,I have watched all four seasons and like the evolution the show is doing. Like most SF shows a lot of CGI and liberties taken with scientific theories but after all that's what science FICTION is.
B00KKGS1KK,DP,5,Good escape!!
B00KKGS1KK,George R. Park,5,Falling Skies.It's great to have this series on again.  I totally enjoy this alternate reality show where the aliens have invaded earth and a small band of human survivors struggle to stay alive.
B00KKGS1KK,Gerbear,4,Getting better each season
B00KKGS1KK,Grandma Geek,5,Great series.  I am so glad we have Amazon Prime so we can watch it without paying gigantic cable or satellite bills.
B00KKGS1KK,Joyce A Campbell,5,Very exciting.  Great characters and actors that you care about.
B00KKGS1KK,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",5,More twists & turns so far.  The Masons  et all are a fun bunch to watch!
B00KKGS1KK,Mike suell,5,Awesome show
B00KKGS1KK,mvlver,4,Still have't got into all the new character's so that is why the 4 stars and not my normal 5. but has great newplot so far.
B00KKGS1KK,Sonshine,5,This is one of the best TV shows EVER!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The characters are engaging and the storyline is intelligent.  I hope to see MANY more seasons!!
B00KKGS1KK,The repair guy,5,Sci Fi at its level best the story mixes with the most interesting characters ever to visit the screen in Sci Fi action TV. The cast is a great mix of good and evil a realistic slice of the human experience. This show must continue it is well thought out and inventive in a new way which should be the new standard in the TV industry for a very long time to come.
B00KOA8UXU,amrbilly,5,it been a long time coming and what a shocker in the end. I like the story about hank miss a lot while he was gone but again it good to see them back!
B00KOA8UXU,Joan,5,Royal Pains is not a pain at all to watch.  Good acting and story line.
B00KOA8UXU,raven,5,loved it!
B00KOA8UXU,serenity83,5,I have enjoyed each episode of this series and am expecting it to be cancelled because I enjoy it.  Not funny.
B00KOA8UXU,William Hodges,5,I have watched all five seasons of the show and was really looking forward to this years series. The start of the season did not let me down. It is a true family show without all of the unnecessary bad talk and sexuality.
B00KPQ7TR6,Anthony J Perri,5,Really well done...strong  stories and appealing characters...nice to have a post apocalyptic virus show without vampires or zombies...science is good...Rhona Mitra very appealing
B00KPQ7TR6,bob is dead,5,This looks like it might end up being a very good series.
B00KPQ7TR6,Gerbear,4,We will see
B00KPQ7TR6,gerry d lay,5,After 1 episode i am hooked It is the most realistic show I've seen in a very long time if they stick to what they've been doing and don't go silly with the writing it will be an exciting successful series written as if it's really happening I love it so far i bought the season cant wait for more.
B00KPQ7TR6,Glenn physics,5,Great show!
B00KPQ7TR6,Jeffery H,5,I was hooked after the first episode. Very good storyline and very believable.
B00KPQ7TR6,Joan,5,Great show.  Pleasantly surprised at the story line and acting in this show.  Not just another fill in before fall.  Good watching!
B00KPQ7TR6,Judith A. Hunt "plant lover/ crafts",4,I find that many new shows are exploring how we as Americans/ humans react to having our normal lifestyles disrupted by events we thought were not possible.  The writers seem to be trying to show good & bad reactions & how we might deal with such scenarios.  This show is not that far off the actual possibility of what might/ could happen someday.
B00KPQ7TR6,Larry Baker,5,Outstanding show!  Not an impossible story line and could very well happen in the near future.Excellent acting and special effects.
B00KPQ7TR6,PATRICIA COLBURN,5,Great series very entertaining -love love love
B00KPQ7TR6,SaraG,5,Such a great story!
B00KPQ7TR6,Yvonne Michel,5,I'm loving this show. I am really impressed by the use of a working navy ship as backdrop. It lends such reality and immediacy to the show. The players are fantastic at expressing the dire and compelling circumstances in the show's story.
B00KPQ862S,k9krzy,5,Great acting - highly recommend it.  Can hardly wait for the next episode.
B00KPQ8L0K,GA girl,5,I never tire of this family. It's funny and hillbilly.  I love those bearded guys!
B00KPQ8L0K,mvlver,5,So far show keeps with the great family theme. Just good old country fun for everyone. Enjoy!
B00KPZIABG,BARBARA RICOTTA,5,love it waiting for more
B00KPZIABG,DIANA T.BARON,5,Love this show !!!!!!!!!!!! The story lines keep u interested !!!!!!!!!!! The actors r great and so easy on the eyes for females and male audience !!!!!!!!!!
B00KPZIABG,K. Leach,5,Great characters and storylines
B00KPZIABG,Kobe 519 "Genevieve Cherry-Sours",5,Don't really care for shows about lawyers but this show is HOT!!! LOVE IT!! I always can't wait for the next episode! ! I love the boldness of language and it keeps you guessing. You never can predict what will happen next like shows that start and end in each episode.  They carry the story over to each new episode.
B00KPZIABG,L. Carson "L Carson",5,Just as expected.  It just gets better and better.  Love the never-ending dynamics among the characters.
B00KPZIABG,MM,5,Truly one of the best shows on TV.  Great law stuff but also great relationship stuff.Hope there will be many more seasons.
B00KPZIABG,Nancy Barrett,4,I love this show and very fond of Rick Hoffman.  I would love to see him in other thedings...I find him soooo cute and talented
B00KPZIABG,Norman,5,Excellent show. Totally enjoy the &#34;no commercials&#34; version here on Amazon.
B00KPZIABG,Peented,4,There are no episodes yet available. All I watched was the interviews with cast and they were enthusiastic and interesting.
B00KPZIABG,Scott Newton,5,I like this show.
B00KPZIABG,Sherrie H,5,I WATCHED SUITS FREE WITH KINDLE FIRE AND I WAS HOOKED. THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF 'LAWYER/COURT' SHOW.SUITS begins  with an adorable fellow who comes in a law office and applies for an associate position. He never went to law school and has passed the bar for many others who have gone to law school. One of the partners (to be) hires him anyway because the guy is a genius and little by little his secret is found out.The story starts there and the storyline(s) and cast are perfection. If you have a Kindle Fire and Prime (worth every penny) check it out for (I think) three seasons free and I guarantee you'll be hooked!I can't wait until the next episode comes on and I can watch without commercials (I hate commercials).
B00KV8A68W,alfredofranco,4,something new and cool to wash
B00KV8A68W,Peter Morrison "Love reading.",4,Very interesting.
B00KV8A68W,ziex,1,Blood and guts ... females expendable
B00KWGDBB2,Dayna Newman "Slasher Diva",4,Fun monster flick with a great ensemble cast and a creature that looks somewhat like the creature in feast.A group of people are trapped in an abandened house in the middle of the woods after being chased or hunted there by The &#34;Animal&#34;.There are people from three different parties trapped and things get heated inside the house as well as outside as the creature stalks his prey.I don't know what's worse the animals inside trying to survive or the one they are trying to avoid.There are some pretty brutal scenes of bloody violence but not a lot of gore.I enjoyed it and I'm a big KeKe Palmer fan as well.
B00KWGDBB2,Route66Review,1,Total- TOTAL C- Movie!I plead that you listen to all the 1 star reviews.  They are not lying!!!  OM Triple GGG!!! This movies gore is not even C minus worthy.  There is none. Sad that the  movie trailer has you  thinking otherwise.  I sat through almost half the movie before I had to turn it OFF.  The folks who are rating this movie 5 star must be part of the filming and acting crew.  Great premise but the monster is throw up ridiculous looking and my gag reflexes would not stop and not because of the movie.  More due to the symptoms of actually paying to see this BEFORE SCHOOL special. Best bet- save your money for an adult horror flick not some third grader pop tart and marshmallow roasting affair.
B00KWGDBB2,some guy,1,It's so misleading.  Don't rent this movie.  Honestly?  It's the script.  The actors are actually decent... but this doesn't play to any of their strengths - they all seem like nice people... nice people who make bad choices.  It's all over the place and the monster looks better when you only see the head - and that's in profile or dead-on.  All in all... not enough redeeming qualities to justify the price.
B00KY50U74,David Asensio,5,im glad it's back for another season i really like this show i think the stories are well done and the actors play there parts well you haven't seen it already you should check it out
B00KY50U74,Keats,4,A better episode than most this season.
B00KYKI2GU,Ms KAM,4,Scary and funny.
B00KYZMSQ0,Bertha Scoggins,5,GREAT!
B00KYZMSQ0,D. A. Donahue,5,Okay I am wondering where this season is heading and that leaves me wanting for more.  I do not want to miss out on an episode and get lost in where the cast and crew are seeking to take us this season.  I look forward to finding out where this new story line is building towards.
B00KYZMSQ0,Douglas C. Meeks "Book Reviews @ Large",5,I have watched every season & every episode.  I thought when I started this was going to be a lot of fluff and impossible things for a woman in high heels.  To some extent the high heels part has happens a time or two but overall this has been a great show and the writers have not let it get stale although it is getting a bit hectic.  We need some downtime to let some of the interpersonal relationships work themselves out. I am concerned that we will not see much of Oded Fehr (the Israeli Mossad agent) since every episode he has been in was exceptional as pretty much anything I have seen him in since The Mummy.I am sure the writers will keep us addicted as always but high stress seems to be the name of the game in this entertaining series.
B00KYZMSQ0,edith banes,4,Good but getting off to a slow start.
B00KYZMSQ0,Ruth M. Capolino "scooter",5,love spy stuff.  hardly can waituntil the next episode.  So well put together is COVERT AFFAIRS!!!
B00KYZMSQ0,Shirley White,5,Wish they would never end this series.  I love it!  Piper is excellent in the lead role and the stories are compelling and of interest.
B00KYZMSQ0,Terry smith,4,still a fun show. She's getting better every season.
B00KZ7XOKQ,Amazon Customer,5,Claymation is wonderful and this is better than a cartoon.  All Shaun the Sheeps are well done with great stories for the PG crowd!
B00KZ7XOKQ,Lurch,5,One of the best shows out there for big and little kids.  It is clean and a great laugh this is a show you don't want to miss.  Bring out the kid in all a great family night show.  You will not be let down an inch
B00L1R7Q76,Glenda Birdow,5,Great show
B00L1R7Q76,marsha janulis,3,Season 3 did not start out with a bang. The story lines and even his halluciations seem to be waning. Eric McCormack was a big draw for me because of his work on Will and Grace; and i stayed with the series because of its suspensful and clever scripts. However Season 3 came in like a whisper not a bang..  Where has the suspence gone?  Even his hallucinations seem mediorce  In season one and two McCormack's acting and that of the supporting cast was &#34;no less than brillant&#34;. All the character's were so deeply rounded that you got lost in the fantasy and felt like you knew them.  But so far Painless has been painless.  Where has the unpredictability gone?  So far the hallucination characters are &#34;unknowns&#34; and play a very small role in the story.  I will still watch because this is a continuing storyline but Season 3 has lost its spark!  Sure hope &#34;the best is yet to come&#34;
B00L1R7Q76,Richard E. Moriarity "rikE2iis",5,Helps me understand me
B00L1R7Q76,William Hodges,5,I was very glad to see my favorite professor is heading back to the states where he does his best work.
B00L1WUD58,Charlotte Roy,2,Move along. Nothing to see here.
B00L1WUD58,Glenda Birdow,4,Enjoyable show with great storylines.
B00L2GPYKW,John E. Klintz "Audiophile",5,This was recently on &#34;Masterpiece Mystery&#34; on PBS; we saw the first episode but missed the rest.  Definitely worth the purchase and the time to watch.
B00L2GPYKW,Liz Hart,5,I love PBS and I adore David Tenant. Had my attention for the whole time. I would highly recommend.
B00L33AF7G,Amazon Customer,5,Love it!  As usual it's good entertainment!!
B00L33AF7G,Anne E. Heinzer "achariane",5,Fantastic! I love the plots and the cast is first class.
B00L33AF7G,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,It is interesting to watch Jane become more interested in having a child since she thinks she is pregnant. The first episode was also sad with the memorial for Frost. A great actor and character was lost to the show and all who follow the two BFFs.
B00L33AF7G,Molly "Molly Rossiter",5,It's hard to go wrong with Jane and Maura - they're the ultimate team.
B00L33AF7G,Pete,4,The show continues to be good entertainment. The personal issues of both Rizzoli and Isles are fun. The crime fighting plot is entertaining. The loss of one of their teammates in this first episode is a surprise (don't want to spoil the plot).
B00L86ZKAK,Amazon Customer,5,Love this series. Cannot wait for the rest of the season. Though I must say I was pretty angry when it wasn't the &#34;mini series&#34; it was billed as originally and I had to wait almost a year for more!
B00L86ZKAK,Capt'n Bub "seau2007",2,And another Stephen King story. That says it all.
B00L86ZKAK,Carla tamari,3,So far a bit lack luster the plot is very slow.  But it is my sort of show .you know all metaphysical and hyperdimensional and stuff. So we will continue to tune in and buy when we have to .
B00L86ZKAK,charles ackley,5,I never watched this show tell this year about a month ago so I seen that amazon was going to stream season two was all over it. the show keeps my attention from start to finish and that means a lot keep up the good work amazon and do more like this like all of cbs shows please
B00L86ZKAK,chinagirl "ncchinagirl",5,**Bit of a Spoiler**Looking forward to learning more about this other world where Junior's mother is at the moment. It is very intriguing that she's not dead and that years ago she saw the future of the dome.Watch it religiously every Friday! I love anything Stephen King!
B00L86ZKAK,Darren Slawson,3,The season so far is crazy people coming together that were mortal enemies previously doesn't make sense and the time frame doesn't make sense at all either
B00L86ZKAK,Dave,1,Last season was so much better.
B00L86ZKAK,Denn,3,The shark jumping is constant.
B00L86ZKAK,Devora,5,Lets hope for another good season they can go several ways I hope it keeps up.
B00L86ZKAK,Doni. Wright,5,absolutely love this show. was very very SHOCKED  in the very first episode.. WOW...
B00L86ZKAK,frank a chambers,5,Under the Dome continues with none of the intensity lost and Mr King made his usual appearance at the diner counter.  It continues to lead one to the conclusions and reasons for the event as all of Mr King's stories have done.  I am enjoying this season as much as last season and recommend it to all sci fi fantasy buffs as it caters to both camps.
B00L86ZKAK,James,5,One of my favorite shows and it took long to get season two out.
B00L86ZKAK,jonoknee,5,I have Been Watching this from the Start. a Great entertainment to watch at my convenience
B00L86ZKAK,J. Phillips,3,This show has not developed the way it needs to in order for succeeding years.
B00L86ZKAK,Larry Lincoln "fifi the cat",5,Again the story continues.  I am glad the decision was made to make the second season.  I hope the series will continue for several seasons.
B00L86ZKAK,Linda K. Holman,5,I love this series. Well worth the watch.
B00L86ZKAK,Mary E. Shipman "LizMoves",5,Great show. Interesting premise. A fun escape.
B00L86ZKAK,Melanie,5,One of my fav shows
B00L86ZKAK,Ms. Annette Arnold "nucie 50",5,The second season of under the dome is good. A series that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.
B00L86ZKAK,NormaJean James,5,This 2nd season is even better than the 1st.
B00L86ZKAK,Patrick R Smith,4,Not sure how much I like the show but it has a good dialog that i can fallow
B00L86ZKAK,Paul A Ream Jr,5,So far the shown has been very exciting by adding new mysteries but answering just enuf of the old ones to keep if interesting and moving forward. So far I'm moving it
B00L86ZKAK,Rating My Best Pick,4,I enjoyed the first season so much I couldn't wait until the second season to start. I hope there is just as much action as there was last season. surprise me!
B00L86ZKAK,RBMiller,2,They need to wrap this series up this season. Acting is awful.
B00L86ZKAK,Roger E. Ervast,4,So far so good.  I just like this show.  I am not sure how it could have gone this far without very much outside help but what the heck.  Glad they didn't hang Barbie
B00L86ZKAK,S. Lasher,5,Very well done Steven King series. Keeps you guessing.
B00L86ZKAK,srrogers50,4,Fun and entertaining series.
B00L86ZKAK,Sylvia Evans,5,I never miss this show - but a storm recently wiped out our tv reception so I was very thankful to be able to watch it later on my Amazon Prime.  It is an addictive show - can not figure out where it is headed at all but I love watching it - so entertaining.  The suspense each week is great!
B00L86ZKAK,Tara A. Hazlett,5,This is a really great show! Very interesting in finding out what the dome is and how all of these poor people are going to make it through this. It leaves you on the edge of your seat just waiting and wanting more!
B00L86ZKAK,The Currdog,4,The Dome has to be real because it cut a steer in half lengthwise and withstood a nuclear blast.
B00L86ZKAK,thepoetnmotion,3,The series is doing what the book does. It's beginning to drag.
B00L86ZKAK,twesjewel,5,This is the second season and it starts off super!  They lay the foundation from last season and outline the direction for the future.  You will be spell bound as you continue to get hooked on this series.  Good watching!
B00L9MZFOO,Madelynne Morris "M.M.",5,Awesome and will be addicting! Great cast and solid character development thus far.
B00LBVQW3Q,A. Zachary,4,Very funny.  Or funny enough. Worth watching. Once. And then maybe like 10-15 years from now. Probably.
B00LBVQW3Q,finley,2,I love Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler but the script is not good.I had to cut this movie off.  This is just too wierd for me.
B00LBVQW3Q,John,1,It wasn't my cup of tea. I know most romcoms stink but I gave this one a chance. Bad idea.
B00LCEPKBM,MM,5,This show just keeps getting better and better. So many twist and turns and who done it stuff.Hopefully there will be more seasons of this great show.
B00LCEPKBM,Ruth M. Capolino "scooter",5,watch this as soon as I can.  Acting is superb.  great great series!!!
B00LCHENE4,C. A. Swift,5,I have always been a Morse fan and was sorry when the old series ended. This is a great way to bring him back. This is interesting to see Morse's early years and how his skills developed. Very enjoyable series.
B00LCHENE4,M. Webster "None",5,I believe I enjoy young Morse more than the older Morse.
B00LCHENE4,will crow,4,i admit i was not really enjoying the type casting with each cop an iconic english 'copper.' but it has weedled it's way in and i've watched all of the episodes now. well done
B00LG0DKBO,barbw,5,So far it seems like a very interesting story and I just love it when Amazon has a current show on Prime.  I watched/taped the first episode and I just hate hate hate hate etc. commercials.  They just ruin the show with their constant interruptions and they last so long and even when I tape the show and fastforward through the commercials it disrupts the show and my focus.  I had quit watching TV shows for many years until netflix and then amazon prime came along.  I really enjoy them now without the commercials.  I love good scify so am really glad this is on prime because this could get really good and has such a great cast.  Thank you Amazon Prime.
B00LG0DKBO,BillR,3,Interesting basic concept with a poor use of flashbacks.  Those flashbacks or back story is important to the overall plot but they are too split up & incomplete after only 1 episode.  This is 'niche' programming that would not have survived a regular television season.  It will be interesting to see the ratings as the series progresses
B00LG0DKBO,Cathy "Kindle Kreature",5,Just hang in there past the slow start.  I can't wait for episode 2.
B00LG0DKBO,Chris NYC,5,This show rocks!I agree with the majority this is a great sci-fi show and I look forward to the next episode to see what is really going on with Dr. Woods character. Extant is really a great show and every moment there is an interesting plot going on. It's certainly worth the time to see and glad to see Halle on television.
B00LG0DKBO,CocoBees_Teaches,4,I liked the first show. It has my attention. Let's see if it can ke it.
B00LG0DKBO,Damian P. Gadal,5,I caught the pilot episode of this show and it looks like it really has some promise. It will be interesting to see how it develops. Can't wait for more.
B00LG0DKBO,Entertaining Read,5,So far the first show has been very good.  Look forward to seeing how it progresses.
B00LG0DKBO,G. Montour "GEM",4,Good acting. Interesting plot. Halle Berry is very good and supporting cast does a solid job. First episode grabbed my attention. Now we'll stick around and see where it goes.
B00LG0DKBO,J. Johnson "Bugs Gma",5,Intriguing so far. Curious to see where it goes. Love the futuristic toys and items.
B00LG0DKBO,Lynn,4,Have not watched all.
B00LG0DKBO,Maureen Barrett,5,I found this to be very interesting.  I can't wait till next time.  Excellent acting also.
B00LG0DKBO,Moss,5,Great show with a plot. My wife and I enjoyed the first episode and can't wait for the second. Halle Berry is a great actress.
B00LG0DKBO,Patois,4,So far it is holding my interest.  I want to know what happens next.  I am always fascinated by the ideas/visions of the future portrayed in movies even the Jetsons.
B00LG0DKBO,S. Lasher,4,Seems like a good Sci-Fi series.
B00LG0DKBO,Victoria J. Dennison,5,This sure seems like it will be a really good series!  Can't wait to see more episodes.
B00LG0DKBO,ZZrider,3,Given time this could be a good show.  I wasn't blown away by the first episode and I'm not sure this will make it past the first year.  Is it better than Defying Gravity or Almost Human?  So far I would have to say no due to slow plotting and questionable writing.  I love Sci-Fi so lets hope this is given a chance to grow.
B00LIRFK5E,P. Tibbs "Pat Tibbs",5,This film is very well made. Roger would give it two thumbs up. See it.
B00LM493J2,Movie 2'sday,4,Never discount the Arnold or he will look at you and say....Awwl bee bock....with yet another fine film!!!!
B00LPWPMCS,Mpr90,5,I love the books! The show is amazing so far. I am very pleased to see the book come to life on the TV screen. Guillermo Del Toro does not disappoint.
