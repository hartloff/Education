    <!--You are given an array A with n entries, with each entry holding a distinct number. You are told that the sequence-->
    <!--of values A[1], A[2], . . . , A[n] has only one positive number at index p (you are not given p). Furthermore, you-->
    <!--know the array is unimodal: The values in the array entries increase from index 1 to index p and decrease from index-->
    <!--p to index n.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--Give an algorithm to find p by reading at most O(log n) entries of A.-->

    <!--You are about to go live with a new website that will be home to a database with sensitive information that poses a-->
    <!--critical security risk. With this, it is likely that some talented hackers will attack the site and-->
    <!--compromise the data. The launch of the site seems somewhat hopeless until a well meaning, yet vague, white hat-->
    <!--hacker informs you that k of the n users of the site are attackers each of whom know a different vulnerability in-->
    <!--your site. You would like to use this information to ensure that the launch of the site goes well.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--The soon to be users and attackers are constantly pinging your site waiting for it to go live. You donâ€™t want to go-->
    <!--live with any security holes, but you can activate a fake site to any subset of the n users by IP address to check-->
    <!--if-->
    <!--any of them are attackers. These fake launches will not expose any sensitive data, but will appear to be a-->
    <!--legitimate launch to the attackers. Each time you launch a fake site, you can tell if there are any attackers in the-->
    <!--chosen subset of users by observing the site after launch. If exactly one hacker attackers the site, you will be-->
    <!--able to analyze the behavior and patch the security hole used to compromise the fake site. However, if more than one-->
    <!--hackers attacking the site on a fake launch they will alter enough of the site that you will be unable to learn-->
    <!--about-->
    <!--the vulnerabilities they exploited. Launching fake sites to different subsets of the user base can be used to-->
    <!--identify attackers and identify security holes, but each launch is expensive and can irritate the legitimate users-->
    <!--of the site.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--Your goal is to identify all of the attackers by launching fake sites that only go live to one attacker at a time-->
    <!--while minimizing the total number of fake launches. You must prove the correctness and analyze the runtime of your algorithm.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Note that an algorithm with O(n) number of launches is trivial: Launch a fake site to each of the n users where they-->
    <!--are the only user of the site. We also know that a lower bound is O(k) since even if we know who the hackers are we-->
    <!--still have to launch k fake sites so we can patch the k vulnerabilities. Your task is to launch with O(k log(n/k))-->
    <!--fake launches.-->
