== Part 1 (30 point)

<p>
    (Textbook Exercise 1 in Chapter 6)
    Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph with n nodes. A subset of the nodes in a graph is called an independent set if
    no two of them are joined by an edge. Finding large independent sets is difficult in general, but here we’ll see
    that it can be done efficiently if the graph is “simple” enough.
</p>
<p>
    Call a graph G = (V,E) a <b>path</b> if its nodes can be written as v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub>,
    with an
    edge between v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>j</sub> if and
    only if the numbers i and j differ by exactly 1. With each node v<sub>i</sub>, we associate a positive integer
    weight w<sub>i</sub>. Note that the nodes have weights in this problem, not the edges.
    The goal in this question is to solve the following problem:
</p>
<p>
    Find an independent set in a <b>path</b> G whose total weight is as large as possible.
</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>
        Provide a counter-example to show that the following greedy algorithm does not always find an independent set of
        maximum total weight. The “heaviest-first” greedy algorithm
        <br/><br/>
        <pre>
1. Start with S equal to the empty set
2. while some node remains in G do
    a. Pick a node v<sub>i</sub> of maximum weight Add v<sub>i</sub> to S
    b. Delete v<sub>i</sub> and its neighbors from G
3. Return S
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Give an example to show that the following algorithm also does not always find an
        independent set of maximum total weight.
        <br/><br/>
        <pre>
1. Let S<sub>1</sub> be the set of all v<sub>i</sub> where i is an odd number
2. Let S<sub>2</sub> be the set of all v<sub>i</sub> where i is an even number
(Note that S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> are both independent sets)
3. Between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, return the one with larger weight
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Now that we've explored 2 incorrect solutions, write your own algorithm that takes an n-node path G with weights and
    returns an independent set of maximum total weight. The running time should be polynomial in n, independent of the
    values of the weights. Prove the correctness and analyze the runtime of your algorithm.

== Part 2 (55 points)

<p>
    You are working as an assistant for a billionaire who is an avid collector of Marvel action figures. There is
    a large auction for rare figures coming up that the billionaire would like to attend, but she will be busy in
    meetings to discuss an upcoming merger so she decides to send you to the auction to make purchases on her behalf.
    She gives you a list of all n items that will appear in the auction along with values quantifying how much each one
    is worth to her along with enough money to outbid anyone else in attendance (i.e. you don’t have to worry about how
    much the items will cost, only their values).
</p>
<p>
    When you get to the auction, you learn a few things about the format. First, you learn the order in which the
    action figures will be presented. You also realize that each time you buy an item, you will have to fill out some
    paperwork to finalize your purchase. You will be so busy with this paperwork, that you will not be able to purchase
    either of the next two items in the auction. Since you have plenty of money, your job is to determine how to
    maximize the total value of the figures you purchase under this format.
</p>
<p>
    More formally, you are given a sequence of <em>n</em> items such that each item <em>i</em> has value
    <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> and if you buy item <em>j</em> you can
    not buy items <em>j + 1</em> or <em>j + 2</em>. Your goal is to maximize the sum of the values of all the items
    purchased.
</p>
<p>
    Give an O(n) runtime algorithm to find a set of items fitting these criteria, prove the correctness of your
    algorithm, and analyze its runtime.
</p>
