== Background

<p>
    Rating systems are all around. Whether we are shopping online, looking for a place to eat, or deciding which movie
    to see many of us will search for other people's opinions before we decide how to spend our time and money. In
    this assignment we will explore different aspects of ratings and reviews while building our own system where we
    can share and analyze preferences.

<hr/>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    For this part of the Ratings and Reviews project we will apply methods from the Utilities class to help us analyze
    song ratings submitted by the class. Through this assignment you will write a java program that will analyze raw
    data in a csv file and determine the classes highest, and lowest, rated songs. More specific details can be found
    in the code provided from the repo.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    Along with the files to define the Ratings and Reviews program you are also provided a Driver.java containing
    calls of many of the program methods and and prints the results to the screen. You are strongly encouraged
    to run this file often and verify that the results are accurate.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Ratings and Reviews we will write several methods that will help to analyze and rank ratings. These
    methods will be contained in a class called Utilities. Specific problem descriptions are provided as comments in the
    handout code and can be seen after cloning the repository.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    The repository includes a Testing class that can be used to test your code without having to submit through AutoLab.
    This class contains one call to the first method for the assignment and you are strongly encouraged to add your own
    test cases for all the other methods as well. When you submit to AutoLab it will give you a know test case that is
    used while grading for each method that is not correct. You should add these test cases to your Testing class to
    streamline your testing process. This allows you to run the Testing class to check your code instead of creating a
    jar and submitting on AutoLAb for every check.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submit a jar file of your project under "Ratings and Reviews - Part 1" on
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/ratingsandreviewspart1">AutoLab</a>.
