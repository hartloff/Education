== Project Submissions


<p>
    For all of the projects, and later labs, you will be submitting you entire eclipse project as a .jar (Java Archive)
    file instead of submitting a single .java file. This is necessary when submitting a project with code in multiple
    files.
</p>

<p>
    To create a .jar file in Eclipse:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        In the left sidebar, right click on your project and select "export"
    </li>
    <li>
        In the export wizard window, choose "JAR file" from he "Java" folder and click next
    </li>
    <li>
        On the next screen, make sure the following boxes are checked
        <ul>
            <li>"Export generated class and files and resources"</li>
            <li>"Export Java source files and resources"</li>
            <li>"Compress the contents of the JAR file"</li>
            <li>"Add directory entries"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the correct project is selected, choose a location to save your file, then click finish to create the
        .jar file containing your entire project
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit this .jar file to AutoLab
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You may submit as many times as you'd like until the deadline. Only your last submission will be counted towards
    your grade. If your score decreases while you are working on a new objective you can always resubmit your previous
    jar file to get your completed objective back.
</p>

<p>
    You progress on the progress objectives will not be reflected on the course website. Your project scores will only
    be shown in AutoLab as this page is only for information.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>All Projects are Due: Friday, May 18th @ 11:59 pm</strong>
</p>

<p>
    * There will be no support from the course staff during finals week

== Ratings

<h4>
    Background
</h4>

<p>
    Rating systems are all around us. Whether we are shopping online, looking for a place to eat, or deciding which
    movie
    to see many of us will search for other people's opinions before we decide how to spend our time and money. In
    this assignment we will explore different aspects of ratings while building our own system where we
    can share and analyze preferences.
</p>

<p>
    By the end of this project we will analyzing ratings of song that have been made by this class of CSE115 student.
    Add your ratings using this the form below and you will compute the top rated songs in the class by objective 5.
</p>


<br/>
<hr/>
<h4>Rate Songs</h4><br/>

<p>
    Use this form to rate songs find the classes favorite songs. Aggregate results will appear here:
    <a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/api/musicRatings/getAllSongs">http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/api/musicRatings/getAllSongs</a>
</p>

<p>
    Each rated song must be linked to a YouTube video by providing the id for the video. This id is an 11 digit String
    that is unique for each video and can be found in the url
    of the video. See <a href="https://docs.joeworkman.net/rapidweaver/stacks/youtube/video-id">here</a> for an example.

<h4>
    Objective 1: Bayesian Average
</h4>
<br/>
<p>
    Your first objective in this project is to compute the Bayesian average for a given list of ratings. The Bayesian
    average is computed by adding a fixed number of extra ratings at a certain value to the existing ratings.
</p>

<h5>Background</h5>
<p>
    By
    comparing items based on their Bayesian average, as opposed to directly using the average of all review scores, we
    can improve the usefulness of these comparisons. For example, in a 5 star rating system an item with 1 rating of 5
    stars will be ranked higher than an item with 200 ratings at an average rating of 4.9. Most
    likely we would prefer the later item since we can be more confident that it is a highly rated item since there are
    200 opinions being considered. To address this we can rank the items by their
    Bayesian rating and choose 5 extra ratings of 3 stars to be added to each item. Now the
    first item has 1 rating of 5 and 5 ratings of 3 for a Bayesian average of 3.33 and the
    second item has 200 ratings at an average of 4.9 and 5 ratings of 3 for a Bayesian
    average of 4.85. Bayesian averages can be used in this way to lower ratings where
    there is not enough information to make a judgment on the item.
</p>

<h5>Tasks</h5>

<p>
    Setup the structure for this project and write a method to compute the Bayesian average of a list of ratings.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new project in Eclipse that will contain you work for all 5 objectives</li>
    <li>Create a new package in the src folder named "ratings"</li>
    <li>In the ratings package, create a new class named "Main" and write a main method in this class. This class
        will be the entry point for the project and will be the only class with a main method. You should use this class
        to test your project
    </li>
    <li>Create a class named "RatingsAnalyzer" in the ratings package. In this new class, write a public static
        method named "bayesianAverage" that takes three parameters (an ArrayList of Doubles, an int, then a double) and
        returns a double. The first parameter represents all the ratings for a particular item, the second parameter is
        the
        number of additional ratings to add, and the third parameter is the value of these additional ratings. The
        return
        value is the bayesian average of these ratings based on these parameters.
    </li>
</ol>


<br/>
<hr/>
<h4>
    Objective 2: Find the Best Song
</h4>

<p>
    Now that we can compute the Bayesian average of a list of ratings we can start computing ratings.
    The first ratings that we'll compute will be of songs. For this objective you will be given a csv file with song
    ratings and you'll compute the song with the highest Bayesian average.
</p>


<a href="/static/data/sample_songs.csv">sample_songs.csv</a><br/>
<a href="/static/data/large_songs.csv">large_songs.csv</a><br/>

<h5>Tasks</h5>

<p>
    Create a Song class, create Song instances based on data read from a file, and compute the Song with the highest
    Bayesian average.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a package named "ratables" inside the ratings package. In the newly created ratables package, create a
        class named "Song" containing the following methods. Note that none of these methods are static since they will
        belong
        to
        instances of the Song class and not the class itself:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                A public constructor taking three Strings as parameters in the order (youTubeID, artist, title). These
                values must be stored in instance variables of your choosing
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "getID" that takes no parameters and returns the youTubeID that was provided when
                the constructor was called as a String
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "getLink" that takes no parameters and return the YouTube url for this song as a
                String. The url must be in the format "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=###########" with ###########
                replaced with the youTubeID for this song
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "getDescription" that takes no parameters and returns a String containing the
                artist and title provided
                when the constructor was called. The format of this description must be "artist - title", as in the
                artist of the song then the title of the song separated by the String " - "
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "addRating" that takes a double as a parameter and returns void. The double
                represents a rating made for this song which must be stored in an instance variable. Note that this
                method will be called each time a new rating in found for the same song and all ratings must be stored
                in an instance variable
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "getRatings" that takes no parameters and returns an ArrayList of Doubles
                containing every rating that was added to this song with the addRating method
            </li>
            <li>[optional] You may add any other methods or instance variables that will help you complete the project
                objectives. For example, it is helpful to override the toString method so you can print out songs
                while testing your program to verify the output
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a new class in the ratings package named "DataSources" that will contains methods that read data into our
        program. In this class write a public static method named "readSongCSVFile"
        that takes one String as a parameter and returns an ArrayList of Songs. The input parameter is the name of a
        csv file containing song ratings where each line is in the format "YouTubeID,artist,title,rating"
        This method will return all the data in this file in an ArrayList of Songs.
        Note that songs can be rated multiple times in the file and each rating must be recorded in the same Song
        object that represents that song. (Hint: The YouTubeIDs are unique and can be used to identify a song and can
        stored in a data structure to check if you've seen a song multiple times. For each line that is read from the
        file, check if the YouTubeID from the line is already in your data structure. If it is, the rating needs to be
        added to the existing Song instead of creating a new Song object. One way to do this is by using a HashMap
        of YouTubeIDs (Strings) to Song objects)
    </li>
    <li>
        In the RatingsAnalyzer class write a public static method named "bestSong" that takes three parameters (an
        ArrayList of Songs,
        an int, and a double) and returns a Song. The method will return the Song from the parameter ArrayList with the
        highest Bayesian average. The int and double parameters are the number of extra reviews and the value of those
        reviews to be used while computing the Bayesian averages (You should call your method from objective 1 to
        compute these Bayesian averages)
    </li>
</ol>


<br/>
<hr/>
<h4>
    Objective 3: Abstraction and Products
</h4>

<p>
    So far our program can find the best song by bayesian average, but what if we want to rate more than just songs?
    In this objective we will refactor our code so it can also be used for Amazon.com products. To do this we will
    create an abstract class that will be extended by both Song and Product classes. With this structure we can easily
    expand our program to rate anything we'd like by writing another class that extends our abstract class and
    implements its methods.

<h5>Tasks</h5>
<ol>
    <li>In the ratables package create an abstract class named "Ratable" containing the following. Note that none of
        these methods are static:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                A public default constructor (take no parameters). This constructor will be implicitly called whenever
                an extending classes constructor is called. You can use this constructor to initialize and instance
                variables that are needed by all sub-classes (ex. An ArrayList of Doubles storing all the ratings)
            </li>
            <li>
                A public abstract method named "getID" that takes no parameters and returns a String. This method will
                be used to return a unique id for any type of Ratable
            </li>
            <li>
                A public abstract method named "getLink" that takes no parameters and returns a String. This method will
                be used to return a url for any type of Ratable
            </li>
            <li>
                A public abstract method named "getDescription" that takes no parameters and returns a String. This
                method will be used to a description for any type of Ratable
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "addRating" that takes a double as a parameter and returns void. The double
                represents a rating made for this ratable which must be stored in an instance variable. Note this method
                is identical to the one from the Song class. The method is being moved from Song to Ratable
            </li>
            <li>
                A public method named "getRatings" that takes no parameters and returns an ArrayList of Doubles
                containing every rating that was added to this ratable with the addRating method. Note this method
                is identical to the one from the Song class. The method is being moved from Song to Ratable
            </li>
            <li>
                [optional] You may add any other methods or instance variables that will help you complete the project
                objectives. For example, it is helpful to override the toString method so you can print out ratables
                while testing your program to verify the output
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Modify the Song class to extend the Ratable abstract class
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Extend Ratable from Song using the extends keyword</li>
            <li>Remove the addRating and getRatings methods from the Song class. Since Song now extends Ratable, and
                Ratable defines these methods, each Song will inherit these methods from the Ratable class
            </li>
            <li>Note that since we already defined the three abstract methods from the Ratable class in the Song class
                there is no more work needed to extend Ratable from Song. However, depending on your previous
                implementation you may have to make a few more changes as needed (ex. Remove a line where you create a
                new ArrayList for the ratings)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>In the ratables package create a class named "Product" that extends Ratable and containing the following:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
                A public constructor that takes 1 String as a parameter. This string represents the asin (Amazon
                Standard
                Identification Number) of the product and it should be stored in an instance variable
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the getID method to return the asin that was provided in the constructor call
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the getLink method to return a link to the product page for this product. The format of this
                url
                must be "https://www.amazon.com/dp/##########" where ########## is the asin for this product
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the getDescription method to return the asin for this product. Note that this is the same as
                the
                getID method
            </li>
            <li>
                Now that we've implemented the 3 abstract methods we have completed this class
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now that we've refactored the our ratables to be either songs or products we will need to write methods in the
        rest of our program that will handle and ratables. To start, whenever we read data from a source we will return
        the data as Ratables instead of Songs or Products. For this task, write a public static method in the
        DataSources class
        named "readSongsAsRatables" that takes a String as a parameter and returns an ArrayList of Ratables. This method
        will read a csv file with Song ratings in the same format as in the readSongCSVFile method. The only difference
        is the return type which is an ArrayList of Ratables instead of an ArrayList of Songs. (Hint: you can call
        readSongCSVFile from this method and add all the Songs into a new ArrayList of Ratables)
    </li>
    <li>
        Write a public static method in the DataSources class named "readProductCSVFile" that takes a String as a
        parameter and
        returns an ArrayList of Ratables. The input String is the name of a csv file where each line is in the format
        "asin,reviewerName,rating,review" and the output is an ArrayList of Ratables containing all the product ratings
        from this file.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the RatingsAnalyzer class write a public static method named "bestRatable" that takes three parameters (an
        ArrayList of
        Ratable,
        an int, and a double) and returns a Ratable. The method will return the Ratable from the parameter ArrayList
        with the
        highest Bayesian average. The int and double parameters are the number of extra reviews and the value of those
        reviews to be used while computing the Bayesian averages. Note that this method can be used for Songs or
        Products.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>
    Objective 4: Top k Lists
</h4>
<p>
    We have a lot of structure in place for our project are we have the flexibility to write code that can be used for
    Songs, Products, and any other class that we add as long as it extends Ratable. For this objective we now want to
    analyze the ratings beyond just finding the Ratable with highest Bayesian average.
</p>

<h5>Tasks</h5>

<ol>
    <li>Write three Comparator classes for Ratables
        <ol type="i">
            <li>In the ratings package create a new package named "comparators"</li>
            <li>In the comparators package create a new class named AlphabeticalComparator that implements the
                Comparator of
                Ratable interface. Implement the compare method to order the ratables alphabetically, ignoring case,
                according to their descriptions (Use the getDescription method)
            </li>
            <li>In the comparators package create a new class named NumberOfRatingsComparator that implements the
                Comparator of
                Ratable interface. Implement the compare method to order the ratables by the number of reviews for each
                ratable in decreasing order
            </li>
            <li>In the comparators package create a new class named BayesianAverageComparator that implements the
                Comparator of
                Ratable interface. Implement the compare method to order the ratables by their bayesian average in
                decreasing order. For this class you will need a constructor that takes an int and a double as
                parameters
                representing the number of extra ratings and the value of these ratings and store these values in
                instance
                variables so they can be used in the compare method
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>In the RatingsAnalyzer class write a public static method named "getTopK" an ArrayList of Ratables, an int (k),
        and a
        Comparator of Ratables as
        parameters and returns an ArrayList of Ratables. This method returns the top k ratables from the ArrayList based
        on the provided Comparator. This method
        must return the list in order such that the first element is the first ratable according to the provided
        Comparator. Ties can be broken arbitrarily
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    While testing you top k method you should write code in your Main class that calls a method from your DataSources
    class to get an ArrayList of Ratables and call getTopK with this ArrayList.
</p>

<h4>
    Objective 5: The Internet
</h4>

<p>
    So far we've been reading data from csv files that are saved on our hard drive. Our next objective to access song
    data that is hosted on the Internet through a web API and use the data in our program. This will allow us to work
    with real-time data that is constantly updating
</p>

<h5>Task</h5>

<ol>
    <li>Write a public static method in the DataSources class named "getSongsFromAPI" that takes no parameters and
        returns an
        ArrayList of Ratables. This method will access the API endpoint at the url

        which will return a JSON array where each element in the array is a JSON object in the format
        {"title":"No Regrets", "artist":"Aesop Rock", "ratings":[5,5,4,5], "youtubeID":"sClhmDN5Fcs"}. The method will

    Debriefing

<p>
    Congratulations! You have written a complete project that analyzes ratings of
    songs and Amazon products. This program has the flexibility to read songs from a file, products from a file, or
    songs from a web API and generate top k lists based on their bayesian averages, number of ratings, or
    alphabetically. By this point you should see that this project can be expanded to rate more types of ratables from
    other sources or by different criteria without adding much additional code. By using object-oriented principles
    we are able to reuse significant amounts of code even if our goals change significantly. For example, we used the
    same exact code to add/store ratings, compare ratable, and generate top k lists based on any of three different
    criteria whether we were analyzing Amazon product reviews from a csv file or song ratings from a web API.
