== Background


<p>
This is the first part of our Word Play homework.  By the end of the
semester we will have built our own simple version of a popular word
game called TextTwist2.  TextTwist2 is a game in which you create
words from the letters in a given seven-letter word.  For example, if
we pick "smooths" as our reference word we can form words such as
"moth", "moths", "moot", "soot", "hot", "toss", etc.
</p>

<p>
There are several websites where you can play this game, including:
<a href="https://www.mindgames.com/game/TextTwist+2">https://www.mindgames.com/game/TextTwist+2</a>
<a href="http://zone.msn.com/en/texttwist2">http://zone.msn.com/en/texttwist2</a>
<a href="http://www.agame.com/game/texttwist-2">http://www.agame.com/game/texttwist-2</a>
You can probably find others.  Read the instructions for the game, and
try it out, so you have a better understanding of what you're aiming
for.  Our rules may be a little different in the end, so don't get too
hung up on the specific rules (especially if you look at several
different websites).

== Part 3

<h4>Due:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Wednesday, November 29 @ <strike>8:00 AM</strike> 8:00 PM</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are giving you a little more time to make up for the missed
opportunities to visit office hours during Thanksgiving week.  Also,
the class on Monday, November 20 will be devoted to homework Q & A, so
come prepared with questions!

<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>8 hours (over two weeks) for basic functionality (4 points)</strong>
    <strong>? hours (over two weeks) for extra credit functionality (2 points)</strong>
</p>

<hr/>


<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Word Play we will bolt on a graphical user interface to the game.  The repository
    contains a runnable JAR file name DEMO.jar.  If you double-click on this in the package explorer it 
    will run a solution that shows you what the finished product should look and behave like.
</p>
<p>
    It is important that you run the demo and explore its behavior -
    for example, there is an extra panel that provides feedback to the
    player when a guess is submitted.  Your submission must provide
    that feedback too.  Note that this functionality may require you
    do add code beyond that which is sketched through the various
    stubbed out methods provided to you.
</p>
<h5>4 proficiency points</h5>
<p>
Build the game to the same level of functionality and performance as
the provided demo.  There will be autograding for these proficiency
points.
</p>

<h5>2 extra-credit proficiency points</h5> 
<p>
If your submission scores 4 points on autograding you may make a
submission for manual grading of additional functionality.  Each extra
credit item succesfully completed will earn 0.5 additional proficiency
points.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Configuration file</dt><dd>Enhance the game so that, on startup,
it reads data from a JSON file named "HW2.config", appearing as a
sibling of the dictionaries folder on the file system:
<pre>
{
  "minWordLength" : 3,
  "mxnWordLength" : 7,
  "fontSize" : 44,
  "maxWordPerTurn" : 24
}
</pre>
minWordLength - the minimum length of any of the words the player
needs to find.  Regardless of the value in the configuration file, the
minimum word length must never be less than 3 and can never be larger
than the maximum word length.  If no minimum word length is specified
in the file the default value is 3.

maxWordLength - the maximum length of any of the words the player
needs to find.  Regardless of the value in the configuration file, the
maximum word length must never be less than the mimimum word length.
If no maximum word length is specified in the file the default value
is 7.

fontSize - the font sized use for all text in the user interface.  If
no default value is specified then 44 is used.

maxWordPerTurn - the maximum number of words to put in the list of
words the user has to guess.  This provides an upper bound.
Regardless of the value in the configuration file, the maximum number
of words per turn must be no less than 5.  If, for a given seed word,
the number of possible words is greater than maxWordsPerTurn, the game
must populate _wordToFind with the specified maximum number of words.
If not default value is specified then the maximum number of words is
unlimited.
</dd>

<dt>High scores</dt><dd>Implement a version of the game in which each
word found counts for as many points as there are letters in the word.  On startup,
the game reads data from a JSON file named "HW2.scores", appearing as a
sibling of the dictionaries folder on the file system.  Here's a sample structure for this file:
<pre>
{
 "194" :   ["bookWorm"] ,
 "192" :   ["ardelia"] ,
 "188" :   ["sam","wolfgang"] ,
 "187" :   ["sally"]
}
</pre>
At the end of the player's turn, their score is the total points for
the all words they found.  Keep a file (JSON again) of the top ten
high scores.  At the start of each game have the user specify a name
for themselves.  Load and display any scores in the high score file in
a separate JPanel in the user interface.  Add a "resign" button so
that a player can end a turn before finding all the words.  At the of
a player's turn add their name and their score to the high score file
if their score was among the top ten.  Drop any scores past the tenth
best score from the file.  Allow ties, so that all players who
achieved one of the top ten scores will be listed (see the two names
for the score 188 in the example, above).</dd>

<dt>Timed play</dt><dd>Implement a version of the game in which the
player has a limited amount of time to find words.  See
the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html">Swing
Timer documentation</a> for help on how to use a timer to trigger an
event.  Allow 60 seconds for a player to complete their turn.  The
time left must be displayed prominently in the Graphical User
Interface.</dd>

<dt>Levels</dt><dd>Implement a version of the game in which, once a
level is completed, a new level is presented to the user.  A player
need not find all the words on a level to advance; a player advances
to the next level if they find at least one of the maximum length
words.</dd>

<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    We again provide a Driver class that you can use for some manual testing of your code.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submit a jar file of your project
    under <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/wordplaypart3">Word
    Play - Part 3</a> on AutoLab.  Remember to check the correct boxes
    in the jar file export dialog.
</p>
<p>
    Autograding for the basic part of the assignment (the first 4
    points) will be available on AutoLab no later than Wednesday
    November 15.
</p>
<p>
    If you score 4 points on the autograded portion of this homework
    you can make a separate jar file submission
    under <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/wordplaypart3extra">Word
    Play - Part 3 - extra</a> on AutoLab.  There is no autograding of
    the extra credit.  Instead, it will be manually graded.  This will take time.  Be patient.

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Word Play we will build out more of the game.  In
    the third part we will build a graphical user interface that will
    complete the game.

<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Word Play we will write several methods that will form the basis for the game. These
    methods will be defined in a class called Model. Specific problem descriptions are provided as comments in the
    handout code and can be seen after cloning the repository.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    The repository includes a Testing class that can be used to test your code without having to submit through AutoLab.
    This class contains one call to the first method for the assignment and you are strongly encouraged to add your own
    test cases for all the other methods as well. When you submit to AutoLab it will give you a know test case that is
    used while grading for each method that is not correct. You should add these test cases to your Testing class to
    streamline your testing process. This allows you to run the Testing class to check your code instead of creating a
    jar and submitting on AutoLab for every check.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submit a jar file of your project under "Word Play - Part 1" on
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/wordplaypart1">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog.
