== Background


<p>
The Geography homework shows you how to manipulate and map geographical data.
</p>


== Part 3

<h4>Due:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Monday, December 11 @ 8:00 AM</strong>
</p>
<hr/>

<h4>Repository Link:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>ssh://ubit@timberlake.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/CSE115/Repositories/Fall2017/HW3_Part3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use the link above and follow the same procedure as you have for the coding exercises in lab.

    Remember to replace "ubit" in the above URI with <i>your UBIT name</i>,
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>8 hours</strong>
</p>

<hr/>


<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this final part of Geography we will add a Graphical User
    Interface (GUI) and a mapping feature.  The application will have
    three windows: a window with controls, a window with search/filter
    results, and a window with a map.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    You should test the basic functionality of methods in a testing
    class.  This time we do not provide that to you, but expect you to
    set it up on your own.
</p>
<p>
    You should test the operation of the GUI by running the program
    and interacting with it.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Autograding will be set up no later than Friday December 1 (but
    probably sooner).  Once it is ready, submit a jar file of your
    project under "Word Play - Part 3" on
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/geographypart3">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog.

    <strong>Monday, October 30 @ 8:00am</strong>

<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>6 hours</strong>
</p>

<hr/>


<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Geography we will build out more of the program.  In
    the third part we will build a graphical user interface that will
    allow us to interact graphically with the data.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    We again provide a Testing class that you can use for some manual
    testing of your code.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submit a jar file of your project under "Word Play - Part 2" on
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/geographypart2">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog.

== Part 1

<h4>Due:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Monday, October 9 @ 8:00am</strong>
</p>
<hr/>

<h4>Repository Link:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>ssh://ubit@timberlake.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/CSE115/Repositories/Fall2017/HW3_Part1</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use the link above and follow the same procedure as you have for the coding exercises in lab.
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiij77tpDM4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiij77tpDM4</a>)
    Remember to replace "ubit" in the above URI with <i>your UBIT name</i>,
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>5 hours</strong>
</p>

<hr/>


<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Geography you will write several methods that give
    you practice writing loops (either for or foreach loops), if
    statements, working with HashMaps and other types, calling
    methods, and applying some of your algorithm lessons from last
    week.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    The repository includes a Testing class that can be used to test your code without having to submit through AutoLab.
    This class contains one call to the first method for the assignment and you are strongly encouraged to add your own
    test cases for all the other methods as well. When you submit to AutoLab it will give you a know test case that is
    used while grading for each method that is not correct. You should add these test cases to your Testing class to
    streamline your testing process. This allows you to run the Testing class to check your code instead of creating a
    jar and submitting on AutoLab for every check.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submissions in AutoLab will be available no later than Tuesday, October 3. Submit a jar file of your project under
    "Geography - Part 1" on <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/geography1">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog!
