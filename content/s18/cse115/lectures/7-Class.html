== Introduction

<p>
    Java was designed from the ground up to be an object-oriented programming language. In java, all of our code must be
    contained within the definition of a class and all of our data, with the exception of primitives (ex. int, double,
    boolean, char), must be contained in an instance of a class called an object. So far, in this course, we have been
    using java as a functional programming language by exclusively writing static methods which are methods that can be
    called without creating an object of the class type containing the method. In this section we start writing
    non-static methods and create objects from our classes.
</p>


<p>
    Why learn classes and objects? Objects help us organize and reuse our code. While there
    <em>technically</em> isn't anything that we can do with classes and objects that we can't do without them, with
    objects our code can be easier to understand and much simpler to expand and maintain.
</p>

<p>
    Although we haven't defined our own classes yet, we have been using classes throughout the course. We've been using
    classes as objects (String, ArrayList, HashMap, Integer, Double), used their static methods
    (System, Math, Paths, Files, Collections), and we came across other classes during our travels without exploring
    much about them (IOException, StandardOpenOption, Comparator, Random). We've also used the following primitive
    types (int, double, boolean, char) as well as arrays which is a basic way to create multiple variables of the same
    type. Throughout this lesson we will revisit many of the classes we've used and gain more insight into how they
    work.
</p>


== Classes

<p>
    A class is a template containing variables and methods. We have written many classes that contain methods, but we
    have not yet seen a class that contains variables. We have used variables throughout the course, but the have always
    been contained inside a method and not in the class itself. When we have variables outside of the methods, we will
    call these instance variables. When we create instances of the class, each instance will contain their own copy of
    all the classes instance variables which can hold different values for each instance.
</p>


<p>
    Let's explore our first example of a class with instance variables and see how they are used. We'll start with a
    class that stores the first and last name of a person.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class Person{

    // Instance variables
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;


    // Default constructor
    public Person(){
        this.firstName = "";
        this.lastName = "";
    }


    // Constructor with parameters
    public Person(String firstNameParam, String lastNameParam){
        this.setFirstName(firstNameParam);
        this.setLastName(lastNameParam);
    }


    // Getter and Setter methods (Accessors and Mutators)

    public String getFirstName(){
        return this.firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstNameParam){
        this.firstName = firstNameParam;
    }

    public String getLastName(){
        return this.lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastNameParam){
        this.lastName = lastNameParam;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    There are a lot of new concepts to discuss in this example so let's explore them one at a time.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Instance Variables</h4>

<pre><code class="java">
    // Instance variables
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
</code></pre>

<p>
    These are the values that will store the state of each instance of the Person class. More simply, we will store
    the first and last name of each person our software should know about in these variables which will store different
    names for each person.
</p>

<p>
    To access these variables (or methods) from within the class we use the <code>this</code> keyword which returns the
    calling instance of the class.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Access Modifiers</h4>

<p>
    Java provides 4 different access modifiers that can be applied to a classes instance variables and methods.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>private: Private variables and methods can only be accessed from within the class itself.</li>
    <li>public: Public variables and methods can be accessed from any class.</li>
    <li>protected: Protected variables and methods can only be accessed by classes in the same package, or any class
        that inherits or extends the class.
    </li>
    <li>default: Default variables and methods can only be accessed by classes in the same package. This is the level of
        access if no access modifier is declared.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Warning: Access modifiers can be a controversial topic among programmers. Since their value is debatable, we will
    not spend much time discussing them in this course.
</p>
<p>
    We will however follow the convention of making all of our instance variables private and accessing them through
    methods called getters and setters (or accessors and mutators).
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Getters and Setters</h4>

<pre><code class="java">
    public String getFirstName(){
        return this.firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstNameParam){
        this.firstName = firstNameParam;
    }

    public String getLastName(){
        return this.lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastNameParam){
        this.lastName = lastNameParam;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    We will never access our instance variables directly from outside the class. We will instead control access to the
    variables through two types of methods, getters/accessors and setters/mutators. This allows us to write more
    flexible code by editing these methods to change the way users interact with their data. For example later in this
    lesson we will change the setters for first name and last name to capitalize the names as they are set. This allows
    us to store all names in a common format even if our users are not consistent in their capitalization. By adding
    some code to the setters, a user could submit their name in all caps or alternate the case of each letter
    ("vErOnIkA")
    and our setter will clean the data before storing it in the instance variable ("Veronica"). Storing user submitted
    data without setters would prevent us from adding this feature without changing our code everywhere the value is
    set. This is the type of flexibility we gain through the proper use of objects and classes.
</p>

<p>
    We have used similar getters and setters to store and retrieve data in ArrayLists and HashMaps.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Constructors</h4>

<pre><code class="java">
    // Default constructor
    public Person(){
        this.firstName = "";
        this.lastName = "";
    }


    // Constructor with parameters
    public Person(String firstNameParam, String lastNameParam){
        this.setFirstName(firstNameParam);
        this.setLastName(lastNameParam);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Constructors are special methods that define how an instance of the class can be created. Constructor methods have 2
    properties that distinguish them from other methods: Their name is the classes name, and they don't have a return
    type. Any method with these properties will be treated as a constructor. Constructors are called using the
    <code>new</code> keyword to create a new instance of the class.
</p>

<p>
    In the Person class we have 2 constructors. The first is the default constructor (no parameters) which initializes
    the instance variables to empty Strings to be set later through a their setters. The second constructor requires a
    first and last name and populates the instance variables with these values. Not all classes will have a default
    constructor and this one could be omitted to require users to provide a first and last names in order to create an
    instance of a Person.
</p>

<p>
    We've been using constructors to create new instances of ArrayLists and HashMaps. We have used the default
    constructor for these data structures which is why the call ends with ().
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; listOfInts = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; mapStringToInt = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>
    These constructors create empty data structures for us to use. We then call their mutator methods (add, put) to
    insert our data.
</p>

<p>
    We've also used constructors to create ints and doubles from Strings. These constructors take a String as a
    parameter.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    int j = new Integer("10");
    double number = new Double("1.55");
</code></pre>


== Objects

<p>
    We create instances of a class using the <code>new</code> keyword to call one of its constructor methods. These
    instances are called objects and each has its own copy of each instance variable defined in the class. In the
    example below we will create
    several instances of the Person class (objects of type Person) and store the instances in variables of type Person.
    Once we have variables of type Person we can call our getter and setter methods defined in the class.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class PersonExample{

    // Names generated randomly from https://www.behindthename.com/
    public static void main(String[] args){

        Person rocco = new Person("Rocco", "Jimenez");
        Person veronika = new Person("Veronika", "Kimberley");
        Person ouri = new Person("Ouri", "Aliberti");
        Person quinten = new Person("Quinten", "Hollins");

        Person mani = new Person();
        mani.setFirstName("Mani");
        mani.setLastName("Victors");

        System.out.println(rocco);
        System.out.println(rocco.getFirstName() + " " + rocco.getLastName());
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println(mani);
        System.out.println(mani.getFirstName() + " " + mani.getLastName());
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println(veronika.getFirstName() + " " + veronika.getLastName());
        System.out.println(ouri.getLastName() + ", " + ouri.getFirstName());
        System.out.println(quinten.getFirstName());

    }

}

</code></pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>
    Person@610455d6<br/>
    Rocco Jimenez<br/>
    <br/>
    Person@511d50c0<br/>
    Mani Victors<br/>
    <br/>
    Veronika Kimberley<br/>
    Aliberti, Ouri<br/>
    Quinten</kbd>

<p>
    Note: The values 610455d6 and 511d50c0 are identifiers for these instances and may be different when you run the
    example. We are not concerned with these values and instead call our getter methods to print the information we
    want.
</p>

<p>
    In this example we are using the Person class to create variables that store both a person's first name and last
    name in a single variable. This allows us flexibility in the way we display their name while organizing the way we
    store this data.
</p>

<hr/>
<p>
    Without objects we might have code that looks like this to store the same information:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String roccoFirstName = "Rocco";
    String roccoLastName = "Jimenez";

    String veronikaFirstName = "Veronika";
    String veronikaLastName = "Kimberley";

    String ouriFirstName = "Ouri";
    String ouriLastName = "Aliberti";

    String quintenFirstName = "Quinten";
    String quintenLastName = "Hollins";

    String maniFirstName = "Mani";
    String maniLastName = "Victors";
</code></pre>

<p>
    While this may not look too bad at first, it will quickly become unmanageable to maintain as we add more features.
    For example, when we want to also store each persons birth date, height, and email address we would need 3
    additional variables for each person instead of adding 3 variables to the class once.
</p>



== Methods

<p>
    Static methods belong to the class. Non-static methods belong to each object.
</p>

<h4>Non-Static Methods</h4>

<p>
    Non-static methods are called from objects.
</p>
<p>
    Non-static methods, or just methods, are called from a specific instance of a class (an object). We've used these
    methods when we have Strings, ArrayList, and HashMaps. These methods use the instance variables of the object to
    accomplish a task.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String paris = "fr,paris,a8,48.866667,2.333333";
    String[] splits = paris.split(",");
    int lineLength = paris.length();
</code></pre>

<p>
    When we call the split and length methods we call them from a particular String object. The split method reads the
    instance variable
    stored in this instance of the String class and returns the value separated by the delimiter, by commas in this
    example. The length method accesses the instance variables and returns the number of characters stored in this
    instance. Since these methods need to access the instance variables of a particular String object, they are written
    as a
    non-static method.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Static Methods</h4>

<p>
    Static methods are called from Classes.
</p>
<p>
    To call static methods we use the name of its class, then the dot operator to access the method. We do not need an
    object of this class to call these methods.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    double x = Double.valueOf("5.5");
    double xSquared = Math.pow(x, 2.0);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here we see 2 difference calls of static methods. From the String class we call valueOf, which is effectively the
    same <code>new Double("5.5")</code> to create a new double value from a String. We then call pow which is a static
    method in the Math class. We call these static methods by using their class names directly instead of instances of
    the classes. In fact, we don't even have instances of String or Math in this example.
</p>


== Override

<p>
    There are times when we want to change the default behaviour of a classes methods. To do this, we will use the
    @Override annotation. We will see more overrides when we explore OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and for now we
    override the toString method. Every class has a toString method, even if it is not explicitly defined, which is
    called to convert an instance of the class to a String. This method is implicitly called when we print an object to
    the screen. We saw this when we printed instances of the Person class which displayed something that looks like
    <kbd>Person@610455d6</kbd>. This default behaviour of toString is to print the name of the class along with an
    identifier for the particular instance of the class. This identifier tells java where to look in memory to find this
    instance.
</p>

<p>
    If we don't want this default behaviour we will override the toString method and replace it's definition with
    a new way to print objects of this type.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    @Override
    public String toString(){
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    With this new definition of the toString method we can print a person's name directly by printing the variable
    directly. Now the statement <code>System.out.println(rocco);</code> in our previous example will now print
    <kbd>Rocco Jimenez</kbd> instead of <kbd>Person@610455d6</kbd>.
</p>


== References

<p>
    On the data structures problem set we saw this question:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    static void Q2(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; input){
        // add the String "movie" to the end of the input list
        input.add("movie");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    How did I grade this? The return type is void and nothing is printed to the screen. There is not output from this
    method that can be read by the grading code.
</p>

<p>
    The answer is a very important feature of java. Objects are passed by reference. That is, when a method is called
    that takes an object as an argument that object is not copied inside the method. The method called instead has the
    <em>same exact object</em> as the calling method. Recall the default value printed from toString <kbd>Person@610455d6</kbd>.
    This is the only value that is passed when a method is called that takes an object (Technically java is
    pass-by-value and that value happens to be a reference). This tells the method that it was given an object of type
    Person and it can be found at 610455d6 which is interpreted by java to find the exact location of the object in
    memory.
</p>
<p>
    This means that in the example above the Q2 method is receiving instructions to find an ArrayList and those
    instructions are stored in the variable <code>input</code>. The grading code also has these instructions and can see
    any changes made to the that particular ArrayList.
</p>

<p>
    Passing references to objects has a variety of implications to consider when writing java code:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Any changes made to an object by a method will also change the object in the calling method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Setting an object equal to another object does not make a copy of the object. Instead, both variable manipulate
        the same object.
    </li>
    <li>
        When calling == to compare two objects it only returns true if the variables point to the same instance. This is
        why we can't use == to compare Strings and instead use .compareTo.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Let's see these features in a code example using instances of our Person class. For this example we will use the
    default toString method.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class References{


    public static void toInitials(Person person){
        person.setFirstName(person.getFirstName().substring(0,1));
        person.setLastName(person.getLastName().substring(0,1));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){

        // Create 2 instances of the Person class
        Person veronika = new Person("Veronika", "Kimberley");
        Person anotherVeronika = new Person("Veronika", "Kimberley");

        // Return false since veronika and anotherVeronika store references to different objects
        System.out.println(veronika == anotherVeronika);
        System.out.println(veronika);
        System.out.println(anotherVeronika);
        System.out.println();


        anotherVeronika = veronika;

        // Return true since veronika and anotherVeronika now store references to the same objects
        System.out.println(veronika == anotherVeronika);
        System.out.println(veronika);
        System.out.println(anotherVeronika);
        System.out.println();


        // Calling toInitials with either variable will change the
        // values of both since they control the same instance
        toInitials(anotherVeronika);
        System.out.println(veronika.getFullName());
        System.out.println(anotherVeronika.getFullName());

    }
