== JSON

<h4>
    JavaScript Object Notation
</h4>

<p>
    JSON is a way to store complex information as strings which is commonly used as a way to communicate information
    over the Internet. When sending information over the Internet we cannot rely on the data types available to us
    through a particular language since the server may be using a different language. For example, how do we send a java
    ArrayList to a server running python? Python has no knowledge of java types and how they are represented at the byte
    level so it would not be able to read the data. However, every language has a way to interpret text by using
    standard encodings (ex. ASCII, Unicode). This allows us to use these encodings to communicate with a server without
    even knowing what language was used to write its code. Since we can send text but not more complex data types we are
    in need of a standard way to encode complex information as text. This is the problem JSON helps us to solve. When
    communicating with a server that "speaks" JSON we will convert our data to a JSON string before sending it to the
    server and expect a JSON string in response which we will parse to convert it into the data types we want to use.
</p>

<p>
    JSON only has 4 types of data that we will use in this course (There are only 6 total, but the remaining 2 are less
    useful
    than the 4 we'll cover). Each of these types is marked using characters in the string itself. These 4 types are:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        String
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Any value in a JSON string in double quotes will be interpreted as a String literal. ex: "this is a string"
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Number
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Any (most) values that are not in quotes will be interpreted as numbers. ex: 5
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Array
    </dt>
    <dd>
        An array in JSON is a comma separated list of values surrounded by []. ex: [5, 8, "data", "elements"]
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Object
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Not to confused with objects in java, a JSON object is a comma separated collection of key-value pairs
        surrounded by {}. The keys in these pairs must be strings. ex: {"department":"cse", "course":115}
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    With these 4 types we can represent astonishingly complex information. The key to this is that the values in arrays
    and objects
    can themselves be arrays and objects which allows multiple levels of nested data. For example, connecting to this
    Music Reviews API (<a href="https://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/getAllSongs">https://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/getAllSongs</a>)
    will return a string in this format:
</p>

<h5>
    [{"title":"God Am (Live 1996)","artist":"Alice in
    Chains","ratings":[5,4],"youtubeID":"74P4W_okEqA"},{"title":"Fade to
    Black","artist":"Metallica","ratings":[5,2],"youtubeID":"WEQnzs8wl6E"}]
</h5>

<p>
    Now we can see how nesting multiple lists and objects allows us to represent information with quite a bit of
    organization in a single string. On the top level, this JSON sting is an array signified by the []'s. This happens
    to be an array of objects where each object represents a song. For each song there are keys for title, artist,
    ratings, and youtubeID mapping to values related to the specific song for that object. The value stored at the
    "ratings" key is another array which contains numbers (no quotes) representing the rating values for that song.
    Once this format is known we can parse these values to retrieve the information for every song through our code.

== The Library

<a href="https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json">https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json</a>

<p>
    We will use the minimal-json library for all our JSON needs. This library is much smaller and more accessible than
    the library used to make HTTP requests.

</p>

== Writing JSON

<p>
    Once we have the library added to our project we can begin writing and reading JSON strings in our java programs.
    We will write these strings by adding our data into instances of the JsonObject and JsonArray classes from the
    library. Once our data has been added to these instances we can call a method to convert it into a String with the
    proper formatting. Since there are both ways of storing key-value pairs, using JsonObject will be similar to using
    HashMap. Likewise, using JsonArray will be similar to using an ArrayList since both are ways of storing an ordered
    list of elements.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonObject;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    JsonObject data = new JsonObject();
    data.add("department", "cse");
    data.add("course", 115);
    System.out.println(data);

    }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>{"department":"cse","course":115}</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    In this example we added two key-value pairs into a JsonObject and printed it to the screen. The toString methods of
    the classes in this library have been overridden such that their instances will print as JSON formatted strings.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that, unlike java, JSON allows data types to be mixed in its arrays and objects. In this example one value is
    a string ("cse") while the other is a number (115).
</p>

<hr/>

<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonArray;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    JsonArray data = new JsonArray();
    data.add(5);
    data.add(8);
    data.add("data");
    data.add("elements");
    System.out.println(data);

    }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>[5,8,"data","elements"]</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    In this example we add data into a new JsonArray and print it to the screen.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    With objects and arrays we can now start building more complex JSON strings. The following example show how we
    combine these types to add complex information into a single string.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonArray;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonObject;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    JsonObject cse115Object = new JsonObject();
    cse115Object.add("department", "cse");
    cse115Object.add("course", 115);

    JsonObject cse116Object = new JsonObject();
    cse116Object.add("department", "cse");
    cse116Object.add("course", 116);

    JsonArray data = new JsonArray();
    data.add(5);
    data.add(8);
    data.add("data");
    data.add("elements");
    data.add(cse115Object);
    data.add(cse116Object);

    System.out.println(data);

    }
    }

</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>[5,8,"data","elements",{"department":"cse","course":115},{"department":"cse","course":116}]</kbd>
</p>

== Reading JSON

<p>
    Reading JSON with this library follows the same concepts as writing JSON, but in reverse. Given a String that
    follows JSON we can convert it into an instance of JsonValue by calling Json.parse and reading the values from this
    instance. When reading JSON it is important to know the format used for the String being read. With this known
    format we can read the appropriate values from the JsonValue instance by first converting it into the type we have.
    Once we know the type of the value we can convert it to that type. Specifically, a JSON String will either be an
    array or an object at it's top level. If it is an object we can call to .asObject() to convert the JsonValue into a
    JsonObject, then read the values by providing the appropriate keys. If it is an array we'll call .asArray(), then
    iterate over its values. Let's see an example of each by reading the JSON String created in the previous examples.
</p>


<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.Json;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonObject;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonValue;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    // The double quotes need to be escaped with the \ character. This tells java
    // that we want the " character instead of ending the String.
    String jsonString = "{\"department\":\"cse\",\"course\":115}";
    JsonValue jsonValue = Json.parse(jsonString);
    JsonObject jsonObject = jsonValue.asObject();

    JsonValue departmentValue = jsonObject.get("department");
    String department = departmentValue.asString();

    JsonValue courseValue = jsonObject.get("course");
    int courseNumber = courseValue.asInt();

    System.out.println(department + courseNumber);

    }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>cse115</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    In this example we parse the JSON String {"department":"cse","course":115} to read each value. There is a quite a
    bit going on here so let's analyze this example in a breakdown.
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>String jsonString = "{\"department\":\"cse\",\"course\":115}";</code> Initialize a JSON String to be
        parsed.
    </li>
    <li><code>JsonValue jsonValue = Json.parse(jsonString);</code> Call parse which is a static method in the Json
        class. This method converts the String into an instance of the JsonValue class giving access to its non-static
        methods.
    </li>
    <li><code>JsonObject jsonObject = jsonValue.asObject();</code> Since we know the format of this JSON String, we know
        that the outermost value is a JSON object. This means we can safely call asObject to convert this JsonValue into
        a JsonObject.
    </li>
    <li><code>JsonValue departmentValue = jsonObject.get("department");</code> Now that our data is contained in an
        instance of hte JsonObject class we can read the information similar to how we read a HashMap. In this line we
        call the get method to retrieve the value stored at the key "department" and store it in a JsonValue variable.
    </li>
    <li><code>String department = departmentValue.asString();</code> Since we know the value stored at the "department"
        key is a String, we can safely call asString to convert the value into a java String. Now that we have the data
        as a java String we can work with it just like any other String value.
    </li>
    <li><code>JsonValue courseValue = jsonObject.get("course");</code> Similar to the value at the "department" key,
        we'll access the value at hte "course" key.
    </li>
    <li><code>int courseNumber = courseValue.asInt();</code> Since we know the value stored at hte "course" key is an
        int, we can safely call asInt to convert it into a java int.
    </li>
    <li><code>System.out.println(department + courseNumber);</code> Print the two values extracted from the JSON String.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You'll notice that in this example we relied on the fact that we know the format of the JSON String we received.
    This is an important part of working with JSON. JSON gives us a way to communicate by providing the notation, but it
    is up to us to agree on the ways we'll use this notation. For example in lab 10 you are submitting song in a JSON
    String with the format:
</p>
<h5>{"title":"Roar", "artist":"Katy Perry", "rating":5, "youtubeID":"CevxZvSJLk8",
    "key":"rf3498phfwqvwlie457fghwlriq347fl"}</h5>
<p>
    When submitting your songs you must follow this format of a JSON object containing key "title", "artist", "rating",
    "youtubeID", and "key" with values related to your song and your API key. Also, the value for rating must be an
    integer with the other values being Strings. It is important to follow this exact format as this is what's expected
    by the server. Likewise, when you get all songs from the server the server will always send the data in the same
    format so you can rely on that format in you parsing code for HW3.

<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.Json;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonArray;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonValue;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    // The double quotes need to be escaped with the \ character. This tells java
    // that we want the " character instead of ending the String.
    String jsonString = "[5,8,\"data\",\"elements\"]";
    JsonValue jsonValue = Json.parse(jsonString);
    JsonArray jsonArray = jsonValue.asArray();

    JsonValue index0 = jsonArray.get(0);
    int firstValue = index0.asInt();

    JsonValue index1 = jsonArray.get(1);
    int secondValue = index1.asInt();

    JsonValue index2 = jsonArray.get(2);
    String thirdValue = index2.asString();

    JsonValue index3 = jsonArray.get(3);
    String fourthValue = index3.asString();

    System.out.println("firstValue: " + firstValue);
    System.out.println("secondValue: " + secondValue);
    System.out.println("thirdValue: " + thirdValue);
    System.out.println("fourthValue: " + fourthValue);

    }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output:</p>
<kbd>firstValue: 5<br/>secondValue: 8<br/>thirdValue: data<br/>fourthValue: elements</kbd>

<p>
    This example is quite similar to the previous example, but show how we read data from JsonArrays by index just like
    we would an ArrayList. However, this is only useful if we know how many elements are in the list which often is not
    the case. When we want to access every element without knowing how many elements it contains, we can use a for each
    loop.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.Json;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonArray;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonValue;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    // The double quotes need to be escaped with the \ character. This tells java
    // that we want the " character instead of ending the String.
    String jsonString = "[5,8,\"data\",\"elements\"]";
    JsonValue jsonValue = Json.parse(jsonString);
    JsonArray jsonArray = jsonValue.asArray();

    for(JsonValue value : jsonArray){
    System.out.println(value);
    }

    }
    }

</code></pre>
<p>
    Output:</p>
<kbd>5<br/>8<br/>"data"<br/>"elements"</kbd>

<p>
    However, when we access the elements of an array in this way have to be careful about hte types of the data. We can
    no longer use asString or asInt in this example since the data types are mixed.
</p>

<br/>


<pre><code class="java">
    import com.eclipsesource.json.Json;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonArray;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonObject;
    import com.eclipsesource.json.JsonValue;

    public class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

    // The double quotes need to be escaped with the \ character. This tells java
    // that we want the " character instead of ending the String.
    String jsonString =
    "[5,8,\"data\",\"elements\",{\"department\":\"cse\",\"course\":115},{\"department\":\"cse\",\"course\":116}]";
    JsonValue jsonValue = Json.parse(jsonString);
    JsonArray jsonArray = jsonValue.asArray();

    JsonObject thisCourse = jsonArray.get(4).asObject();
    int courseNumber = thisCourse.get("course").asInt();

    System.out.println(courseNumber);

    }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>115</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    This example shows a combination of the previous examples to show how we can access data from an object which is an
    element of an array.
