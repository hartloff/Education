[Friday - Clean up of what wasn't covered between writing files and parsing csv]

== Exceptions

<p>
    So far everything in the programs we've written have been within our control and any errors have been caused by our
    code. This is no longer true when we start working with files that may not have been written by our code. When
    working with files we will write code to interact with the file system of different machines with different
    operating systems and file permissions to read an write files that can be modified, or even deleted, by other
    programs and users. Needless to say, there's a lot can go wrong and our code must be able to handle any situation
    without crashing. We will accomplish this using exceptions along with try/catch blocks.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    try{
        // risky code
    } catch ([Expected Exception type] [exception name]){
        // code to run if the exception is thrown
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is the basic syntax we will see when writing code that can cause errors (throw exceptions). When working with
    files we will catch the IOException.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    try{
        // code to open a file
    } catch (IOException ex){
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example we write all the code to interact with a file within the try block. If anything causes an error
    while trying to open the file, an IOException will be thrown and control will immediately move to the catch block.
    In this block we will write any code needed to handle the situation and after the code is executed the program will
    continue after the try/catch blocks. In this case if there is an error opening the file we print the error message
    to the
    screen and continue with the program.
</p>

<p>
    The most common cause of an IOException that we'll see is trying to open a file that doesn't exist.
</p>

== Reading Files


<pre><code class="java">
    String filename = "test.txt";
    for(String line : Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filename))){
        System.out.println(line);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    This code snippet will read a file named "test.txt" and iterate over each line in a for-each
    loop. Inside the loop we print each line to the screen. This is the syntax we will use to read files in this course.
</p>

<p>
    Note: There are many ways to open files in java that you are free to explore. Each has certain advantages and
    disadvantages though you can complete all the assignments for this course using the method shown in this section
</p>

<p>
    We've explored most of the concepts in this snippet except <code>Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filename))</code>. In
    this code we see 2 more java classes (Files and Paths) that contain more methods that help us accomplish our goals.
    First, the Paths.get method converts a String into a Path to a file. To us, the String already told us the path to a
    file, but this methods converts that String into a Path that java will understand. Once we have a Path to a file we
    call Files.readAllLines which reads a Path and returned a List of Strings containing all the lines of the given
    file. We use this list in a for-each loop to iterate over the lines one at a time.
</p>

<p>
    Since we used 2 more java classes we must remember to import these classes.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    import java.nio.file.Files;
    import java.nio.file.Paths;
</code></pre>

<p>
    To complete this example we need to add a try/catch block. As mentioned earlier, reading from a file can cause
    errors that are out of our control and we need to specify how our program will react to an error in a catch
    block.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    try{
        String filename = "test.txt";
        for(String line : Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filename))){
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    } catch (IOException ex){
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now if there is an error it will be caught and we will print the error message to the screen. If we don't handle
    this error the program will not run! It will instead alert you of an <code>Unhandled Exception</code> and refuse to
    run.
</p>

<p>
    Since IOException is another java class it too must be imported for this program to run. Putting everything together
    we have the following program.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReadExample {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        try{
            String filename = "test.txt";
            for(String line : Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filename))){
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This program will attempt to read <code>test.txt</code> and print its contents to the screen. If an error occurs
    while reading the file (ex. the file doesn't exist) the catch block will execute and the error will be printed
    <em>without</em> crashing the program.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>String to number</h3>

<p>
    We will often want to read numbers from files, but we read data from files as Strings. Recall that when we use the
    wrapper classes for primitives we gain access to methods that can help us work with these values. We can use one of
    these methods to create Integers and Doubles from Strings.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    int j = new Integer("10");
    double number = new Double("1.55");
</code></pre>

<p>
    By creating a new Integer or Double and providing a String in the proper format for each type of number we can
    convert the String to number. The method we are using is called a constructor which is a special type of method that
    is called when a new object is created. Note that even though we are creating new objects (the type starts with an
    uppercase
    letter) we can store the values in primitive variable (the type starts with a lowercase letter) and java will
    automatically convert between the two types.
</p>



== Writing Files

<p>
    To create a and write to a file in java we will use the follow method calls which are similar to the way we read
    files.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String filename = "example.txt";
    String textToWrite = "This will be written to the file";
    Files.write(Paths.get(filename), textToWrite.getBytes());
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    If a file with the give name already exists, Files.write will overwrite the existing file without warning.
</div>

<p>
    Here we use the Files.write method which takes a file Path and the text to write to the file as arguments. The file
    must be specified as a Path just like it did for reading files so we will the filename as a String to the Paths.get
    method to covert it to a Path. Next, the method requires an array of bytes to write to the file. Conveniently, the
    String class contains a method called getBytes that will return an array of bytes representing the value of the
    String. By calling both Paths.get and getBytes we convert the inputs into the format expected by Files.write.
</p>


<p>
    Adding all our import statements, try catch, and class definition will yield the following java program.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.nio.file.Files;
    import java.nio.file.Paths;

    public class Example {

        public static void main(String[] args){

            try{
                String filename = "example.txt";
                String textToWrite = "This will be written to the file";
                Files.write(Paths.get(filename), textToWrite.getBytes());
            }catch(IOException ex){
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }

        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    If we know a file with the given name already and we want to add to the end of the file without overwriting the
    original we can use the append option as follows.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    Files.write(Paths.get(filename), textToWrite.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
</code></pre>

<p>
    This append option is part of a class we haven't used yet so we also need to import this class <code>import
    java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;</code> before use. If the append option is used and the file does not already
    exist a <code>NoSuchFileException</code> will be thrown.
</p>

<p>
    Note: As with reading from files, there are many different ways to write files in java. This methods provides simple
    syntax making it a good choice for writing your first files and you are encouraged to explore other methods once you
    are comfortable with Files.write.
</p>



== Array

<p>
    Before we can explore CSV we'll need to learn about arrays. An array is a very basic data structure that does little
    else besides store data. In fact an ArrayList uses an array to store data, but adds many useful methods such as add
    and contains.
</p>

<p>
    The following example shows all ways we interact with arrays.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String[] stringArray = new String[3];

    stringArray[0] = "firstElement";
    stringArray[1] = "secondElement";
    stringArray[2] = "thirdElement";

    System.out.println(stringArray[1]);
    System.out.println(stringArray.length);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>secondElement<br/>3</kbd>

<p>
    Here we notice that [] are used extensively when working with arrays and they are used where we usually expect ().
    Here are the important points to note from the example above:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>To create an array variable we add [] after the type we want to store.</li>
    <li>When we create an array we must declare it's size in brackets. This size is the number of number of values of
        the specified type that can be stored in the array.
    </li>
    <li>The size of an array cannot change.</li>
    <li>We insert and access values using brackets with an index number. we can think of stringArray[0] being the
        variable name for the first element of the array, as in [0] is part of the variable name and only the index
        changes for each elements. This array really behaves as 3 separate variables.
    </li>
    <li>We can access the size of the array using stringArray.length. Note that this is not a method call since there is
        no () at the end. This is accessing an int variable named length which is stored in the array.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Since ArrayLists add many more features to arrays (most importantly a dynamic size) we tend to favor the ArrayList
    over a plain array. We will however need to know how to work with arrays as we'll see when working with data stored
    in the CSV format. In this case we will us a String method called split which will return an array of Strings which
    we'll need to know how to access to read the data we need.
</p>

== Comma Separated Values (CSV)




<h4>Alan's guest lecture material:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/static/CSVFiles.pptx">CSV Slides</a></li>
    <li><a href="/static/src.zip">Code example</a></li>
</ul>


<p>
    As we store data in files that can be read by a wide variety of programs we have a need to agree on common ways to
    store our data. If we follow a common format it allows us to communicate across programs writen by other people and
    possible in different languages. The first format we will is comma separated values or CSV (The next format we study
    will be JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation). Data stored as CSV is, as the name implies, separated by commas. In a
    csv file we can have each line contain several pieces of information separated by commas with each line representing
    different data. A sample of a CSV file stores stock prices and volume could look like this.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    2016-12-06,109.949997,26075900
    2016-12-05,109.110001,34037300
    2016-12-02,109.900002,26409800
    2016-12-01,109.489998,36825800
</code></pre>

<p>
    This sample happens to contain the information about Apple's stock over the first few trading days in December 2016.
    Here, the first value contains the date, the second value is the price of a share of the stock, and the third value
    is the trading volume (number of shares traded that day). Each value is separated by comma to indicate that a new
    value is starting. Since the values are separated in a predictable way we can write software that will look for
    commas and split the data accordingly. We will accomplish this using the split method for Strings.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String allValues = "2016-12-06,109.949997,26075900";
    String[] data = allValues.split(",");
    System.out.println(data[0]);
    System.out.println(data[1]);
    System.out.println(data[2]);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>2016-12-06<br/>109.949997<br/>26075900</kbd>

<p>
    Using the split method allows us to split a string using any other string as a separator, in this case a comma. The
    split method returns an array of Strings and its elements can be accessed using the array notation []. Care must be
    taken to not attempt to access an element at an index that does not exist (For example, accessing the 4th element
    when there are only 3 values).
</p>

<p>
    If you prefer to not work with arrays you can add the data into an ArrayList using the Arrays.asList method as
    follows.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    String allValues = "2016-12-06,109.949997,26075900";
    String[] data = allValues.split(",");
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; dataInList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(data));
    System.out.println(dataInList.get(0));
    System.out.println(dataInList.get(1));
    System.out.println(dataInList.get(2));
</code></pre>
<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>2016-12-06<br/>109.949997<br/>26075900</kbd>

<p>
    This code accomplishes the same task as the previous example but adds the data into an ArrayList instead of using
    the array. There is mostly no difference between the two samples, besides performance, so you can choose whether to
    use arrays or ArrayLists.
</p>
