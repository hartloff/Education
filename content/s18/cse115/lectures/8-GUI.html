== GUI

<p>
    So far everything we've done has lived in the command line. Whenever we wanted to output something to the users of
    our software we have been using <code>System.out.println</code> to display text to the console, and inputs needed to
    be made in code or through other files. In this section we will build GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) to interact
    with our users more intuitively.
</p>


<p>
    In this section we will cover a few components from the built-in java swing library. For a comprehensive swing
    tutorial the official tutorial is recommended (<a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/index.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/index.html</a>).
</p>

== JFrame

<p>
    It all starts with a JFrame. We will use javas built-in swing components to build GUIs. The base component in this
    library is the JFrame which creates a window for our applications.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
import javax.swing.*;

public class Example{

    public static void runGUI(){
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("First GUI");
        frame.setSize(600, 400);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }


    public static void main(String[] args){
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                runGUI();
            }
        });
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Our first JFrame isn't very interesting, but this example shows the important aspects of setting up a GUI. First,
    we'll notice that the main method calls <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater</code> on a new instance of the Runnable
    class. We Override this classes run method with a call to a method that initializes our GUI using syntax similar
    custom sorting using the Comparator class. This will run our GUI on a separate thread allowing us to continue our
    program while the GUI interacts with the user separately. This is called multi-threading and is a topic beyond the
    scope of this class so we will this conversation for a later course.
</p>

<p>
    Now let's look at the <code>runGUI</code> method that sets up the GUI itself. First, we need a JFrame so we create
    one using one of the JFrame's constructors. We call that constructor that takes a String as input which will be the
    title of the frame. This text will display in the title bar of the created window. Next, we set the size of the
    window in terms of pixels (600 pixels wide and 400 pixels for the height). Next we define what should happen when
    the window is closed. In this example we want our program to end so we'll set the close operation to exit. The final
    step is to actually display the GUI by setting its visibility to true. After all these steps we will have a GUI in
    the form of a JFrame with no components. In the rest of this section we will see a variety of components we can add
    to this frame to achieve the desired look and feel of our programs.
</p>

== Output Components

<p>
    We will not add components to our JFrame directely, but instead to its content pane which we'll access through its
    getter method <code>getContentPane()</code>. Once we have the content pane we can start adding components.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    frame.getContentPane().add(new JLabel("First Label"));
</code></pre>

<p>
    The first component we're adding is a JLabel. This JLabel provides a way to display text to our GUI by provided the
    String to be displayed in its constructor call. Here we are adding a new JLabel with the text "First Label" to the
    JFrame's content pane.
</p>

<p>
    We can also add images to our GUI by adding an ImageIcon to our JLabel:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    ImageIcon image = new ImageIcon("path/to/image");
    frame.getContentPane().add(new JLabel(image));
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here we create a new ImageIcon by providing the location of an image file, then adding a new JLabel to the content
    pane while providing the image in the constructor of the JLabel.
</p>

<p>
    We can also add images from the Internet by providing a url. Since reading the url can throw an exception we must
    use a try/catch block to get the image.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    ImageIcon image = null;
        try{
            URL url = new URL("http://www.buffalo.edu/UBT/UBT-archives/volume25number1/images/sports01.jpg");
            image = new ImageIcon(url);
        }catch(MalformedURLException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    frame.getContentPane().add(new JLabel(image));
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example we download a jpg image from the Internet and display it on our GUI.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>JPanel</h4>

<p>
    In the previous examples we added GUI components directly to the content pane of our JFrame which works, but can
    become difficult to maintain as our GUIs grow in complexity. For this reason we will add components to a JPanel,
    then add the JPanel to the JFrame's content pane. We will add components to a JPanel in a very similar way to adding
    them to a JFrame.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    panel.add(new JLabel("First Label"));
    panel.add(new JLabel("Another Label"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(panel);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here we create a new JPanel, add 2 new JLabels to it, then add the JPanel to our JFrame's content pane. This will
    display both labels on the GUI from left-to-right in the order they were added (This is the default behaviour of
    JPanel).
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>BorderLayout</h4>

<p>
    What if we want more control over the location of each element added to our GUI? For this, there are several
    different Layout Managers that can be used. We will only explore one of these, BorderLayout, which is the default
    layout for a JFrame. Alternatively the left-to-right behaviour of a JPanel is called FlowLayout. FlowLayout will
    automatically place the elements left-to-right as they are added, but with BorderLayout we must specify where each
    component should be displayed as either NORTH (top), SOUTH (bottom), EAST (right), WEST (left), or CENTER (default
    location).
</p>


<pre><code class="java">
    JPanel northPanel = new JPanel();
    northPanel.add(new JLabel("north"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(northPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);

    JPanel southPanel = new JPanel();
    southPanel.add(new JLabel("south"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(southPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

    JPanel eastPanel = new JPanel();
    eastPanel.add(new JLabel("east"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(eastPanel, BorderLayout.EAST);

    JPanel westPanel = new JPanel();
    westPanel.add(new JLabel("west"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(westPanel, BorderLayout.WEST);

    JPanel centerPanel = new JPanel();
    centerPanel.add(new JLabel("center"));
    frame.getContentPane().add(centerPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
</code></pre>

<p>
    When we add components to the JFrame using the BorderLayout we will specify its location using the BorderLayout
    constants (ie. BorderLayout.NORTH) as a second argument to the add method. In this example we add a different panel
    to each of the 5 areas of the GUI. If we add another element without providing a location it will be placed in the
    center of the GUI.
</p>

<p>
    CAUTION: Only one element can be placed in each of these 5 areas. Adding a second element to an area will overwrite
    the first component.
</p>


== Input Components

<p>
    We can create a new window through a JFrame, add text and images with JLabels, and organize components with JPanels
    and BorderLayout, but our users still can't interact with our GUIs. Let's give our users the ability to use these
    interfaces and make the most out of software.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    JTextField textField = new JTextField(5);
    panel.add(textField);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
    JPanel panel = new JPanel();
    JButton button = new JButton("Click Me!");
    panel.add(button);
</code></pre>

<p>
    With syntax nearly identical to that of JLabels, these examples show us how to add a new button and a text field to
    a panel. The text field gives users an area to type and the int in the constructor determines its width in terms of
    number of columns. The String in the constructor of the button is the text to appear on the button.
</p>
<p>
    That wasn't so bad, but there's one huge problem here. Our button doesn't do anything! This shouldn't be surprising
    since we didn't tell our button to do anything so it shouldn't know what we would expect to happen when it's
    clicked. Let's tell our new button what to do. For this, we will use an ActionListener.
</p>

<hr/>


<!-- Make the interfaces explicit -->


<h4>Action Listeners</h4>

<p>
    To add functionality to our button we will add an action listener to it with the same style of syntax we've seen
    for custom <a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/learn/courses/CSE115/lectures/algos/#section5">sorting</a> and
    running our GUIs with invokeLater.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JButton button = new JButton("Click Me!");
    button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
            // code to be executed when the button is clicked
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>
    This will add an action listener to the button that will "listen" for clicks on the button. When the button is
    clicked the action listener will know and will call its actionPreformed method with an ActionEvent containing
    information about the action (location of mouse, right/left click, clicked via space bar, etc). If we want to
    perform the same action for all types of events we can ignore the ActionEvent, but it's there if we want to add more
    flexibility later.
</p>

<p>
    Now that we have an action listener, we can run any code we'd like whenever our button is clicked. Let's use this
    code to interact with other components on our GUI and learn how to interact with them.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JLabel label = new JLabel("hello!");
    JButton button = new JButton("Click Me!");
    button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
            label.setText("goodbye!");
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>
    JLabels and JTextFields have getter and setter methods for the text they currently display. We can take advantage of
    these methods in our action listeners to build features into out interface. In this example we are changing the text
    of a label when the button is clicked.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JTextField textField = new JTextField(5);
    JButton button = new JButton("Click Me!");
    button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
            String input = textField.getText();
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>
    Similar to the JLabel, we can get and set the text of a text field. By using a text field and a button in this way
    we can allow the user to input and String for our program to use.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Key Listeners</h4>

<p>
    Similar to listening for mouse clicks on a button, we can also listen for keyboard inputs on a text field. To do
    this, we will use a key listener. Key listeners have three different actions that it listens to "key typed", "key
    pressed", and "key released". In this example we will only use "key pressed" which is triggered as soon as a key is
    pressed without waiting for it to be released.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JTextField textField = new JTextField(5);
    textField.addKeyListener(new KeyListener(){
        @Override
        public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e){

        }

        @Override
        public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){
            if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER){
                // code to be executed when the enter key is pressed
                // This is especially useful for text fields since it allows the user to hit
                // enter to submit their text instead of having to click a button
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e){

        }
    });
</code></pre>


<p>
    Unlike the action listener example we will read information from the event to find which key was pressed. We will
    get the event's key code and compare it with the code for the key we want to listen to. Here we lister for an enter
    key press which uses the constant <code>KeyEvent.VK_ENTER</code> for its code.
</p>


<hr/>

<h4>Combo Box</h4>

<p>
    More commonly referred to as dropdown menus, we'll use the JComboBox to give our users a list of choices. We'll see
    that combo boxes behave similar to ArrayLists in that they take a type parameter and we can add instances of that
    type as the choices in the menu. The menu will display each choice as a String by calling its toString method,
    though the instance itself is selected.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JComboBox&lt;Double&gt; dropdown = new JComboBox<>();
    dropdown.addItem(Math.E);
    dropdown.addItem(Math.PI);
    panel.add(dropdown);
</code></pre>

<p>
    We created a new combo box of Doubles and added two choices by calling the addItem method. This gives the user a
    choice between e and pi (tough choice..). Then we can read this choice in a listener.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    Double number = dropdown.getItemAt(dropdown.getSelectedIndex());
//  -or-  Double number = (Double) dropdown.getSelectedItem();
</code></pre>

<p>
    Just like an ArrayList, the combo box stores its choices indexed by integers starting at 0. We can get the index of
    the selected item by calling getSelectedIndex() then call getItemAt(int) which returns the item at that index.
    Alternatively we can call getSelectedItem() to get the item directly, though this returns it in an Object variable
    which needs to cast to type Double using (Double).
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Text Area</h4>

<p>
    Text areas are very similar to text fields except they can contain more than one line. Instead of specifying only
    the number of columns in its constructor as we did with the JTextField, we will provide ints for rows and columns.
    The following example creates a text area with 5 rows and 30 columns.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea(5,30);
    textArea.setText("text\ntext\ntext\ntext\ntext\ntext");
    panel.add(new JScrollPane(textArea));
</code></pre>

<p>
    We could have added this text area to the panel just like any other component, but instead we added
    <code>new JScrollPane(textArea)</code> to add the text area to a scroll pane. By adding a scroll pane we will have
    a scroll bar once the text area has more lines of text than rows to display. If we add the text area without the
    scroll pane the numbers of rows will increase to the number of lines of text. Either behavior is fine depending
    on the situation and desired aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes we want to use text areas strictly as an output component much like we did in the lab 9 chat room. In
    these cases we can prevent users from entering text with <code>textArea.setEditable(false);</code>.
</p>
