    https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>
</p>
<p>

    All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
    any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
    or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
    be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
    submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students are
    in
    violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
</p>
<p>
    All violations will result in:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE115.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<p>
    It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
    any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
    clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
    have been caught.

</p>
<p>
    Examples of acceptable behavior:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming abstract solutions, then writing
        code independently.
    </li>
    <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the homework topics.</li>
    <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submitting code that you did not write.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to see your code for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with another student to write code together for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to access your code. (Example: Do not host your code in a public
        repository)
    </li>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code found on the Internet into your submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you plan on cheating, plan on taking this course again.
</p>

== Grading

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is no curve for this course. There will be no changes to the grading policies or grade cutoffs
    throughout the semester.
</div>


<p>
    There are 2 different types of points that you will earn throughout this course:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Competency Points</b>: Earned by showing basic competency of course concepts.  There are a total of 4200 competency points available.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Proficiency Points</b>: Earned by showing advanced competency and application of course concepts.  There are a total of 90 proficiency points available.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Final letter grades will be determined by a combination of these
    two point types.  If you earn less than 2500 competency points
    your course grade is 'F', regardless of how many proficiency
    points you have earned.  If you have earned at least 2500
    competency points then your proficiency points determine the
    letter grade you receive in the course, as shown in this table:
</p>
<br/>
<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny" style="text-align:center">
    <tr class="active">
        <th><b>Competency Points</b></th>
        <th><b>Proficiency Points</b></th>
        <th><b>Letter Grade</b></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="9">&gt;= 2500</td>

<h4>Labs</h4>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Lab attendance is required.
</div>

<p>
    <b>
        3000 competency points; 24 proficiency points
    </b>
</p>

<p>
    There will be 12 graded labs throughout the semester. Each lab will consist of both a quiz and coding assignment
    on the concept covered in the previous week of lecture.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Lab Quizzes</strong>: Each lab will start with a short quiz based on the concept covered by that lab. Each
    lab quiz will provide an opportunity to earn up to 100 competency points.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lab Coding</strong>: Following the quiz will be a coding exercise that must be completed before the end of
    the lab period in order to earn credit. Each lab quiz will provide an opportunity to earn up to 150 competency
    points for the basic assignment as well as 2 proficiency points for completing additional challenges. The course
    staff will assist students as they code, but will not provide solutions.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Student expectations:</b> It will be assumed that all students have a basic understanding of the concept
    covered in the previous week of lecture before lab begins. The course staff will rely on this understanding
    and focus on applications of each concept.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Homework</h4>
<p>
    <b>
        36 proficiency points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    There will be 3 mini-projects in this course each divided into 3 homework submissions for a total of 9 submissions.
    Each submission will contain opportunities for 4 proficiency points. These assignments will be completed
    outside of lecture and lab and will be more complex than any other part of the course. Each homework is designed
    to simulate a problem that may be faced in the real world and will require intuition and creativity to complete.
    Preparing students to solve these problems is the primary objective of the course. Any student who can complete all
    3 mini-projects will be well prepared for success in an age based on computers.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Student expectations:</b> For each homework students will be expected to apply and combine all concepts covered
    in lab prior to the deadline for the homework. To complete each homework students are required to think critically
    and discover ways to combine concepts that have not necessarily been explained by the course staff.
</p>


<hr/>



<div><h4>Final Exam</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        1200 competency points; 10 proficiency points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    There will only be one exam in the semester which is scheduled during finals week. This exam will contain 1200
    competency points worth of questions providing an opportunity for students to make up for points missed in labs.
    In addition, there will be 10 proficiency points available for completing challenging questions.
</p>

<hr/>

<div><h4>TopHat Questions</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        10 proficiency points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Most lectures will contain a small number of questions asked through TopHat. The number of proficiency points earned
    through these questions will be determined by the percentage of questions correctly answered throughout the
    semester. Each question answered incorrectly will still earn the students 1/2 credit for the question (ie. A
    student who answers every question cannot get less than 50% score). Points will be awarded according ot the
    following chart with any boundary cases being rounded up (ex. 80.0% earns 8 points).

<div><h4>Lecture Activities</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        10 proficiency points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the semester there will be 11 lecture activities worth 1 proficiency point each. One activity will be
    excused/dropped resulting in 10 total proficiency available throughout the semester (A student completing all 11
    activities will still earn 10 points).
</p>

<hr/>

<div class="alert alert-warning">No late assignments will be accepted. Late submissions will result in a grade of 0.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">The course staff reserve the right to challenge any points earned by any student. If
presented with a challenge, the student must demonstrate an understanding of their own code or the points will be
revoked. Challenges will be made at the discretion of the course staff.
