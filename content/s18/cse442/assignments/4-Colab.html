== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Assigned Task: Complete the task to which you wre assigned</li>
    <li>On-board Developer: Help the developer assigned to your task</li>
    <li>Alpha Testing: Alpha test specified projects</li>
    <li>Alpha Release Maintenance: Communicate with your alpha testers and fix any reported bugs</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Collaborate with professionalism. This objective will be assessed on an individual
    basis, though there
    are various team accomplishments that will help individuals meet this goal (Ex. clear on-boarding documentation).
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The developer communicated effectively</li>
    <li>The developer was professional throughout our interactions</li>
    <li>The developer completed expectations</li>
</ol>
<p>
    These criteria will be assessed by anyone interacting with you throughout this phase while you complete the 4
    requirements. Note that any communication that does not occur in public channels endorsed by the course
    <!--(Ex. GitHub, Gitter, Jury Duty forms)-->
    cannot be used to make grading decision since the course staff do not have
    access to other channels. (ie. If you get a low score for communication you can't claim that you sent a lot of
    really
    great texts so you should get this point. If we can't verify something we must rely on the jury duty
    ratings)
</p>


== Assigned Task

<p>
    During this phase you be assigned task created by another developer in the class. The task assignments will be made
    randomly by the course staff. To complete this task you will find the "help wanted" GitHub issue created by the
    assigned developer in their repository and contribute code to their project that satisfies the issue. You can,
    and should, contact the task
    owner via GitHub and/or Gitter to ensure that you complete the task properly.
</p>
<p>
    You must
    follow the code contribution protocol for this task except you will fork their repository and create a new branch
    in this forked repo instead of creating a branch directly in their project.
    You cannot be added as a collaborator
    on their project and you will not have push access to their repository.
</p>

<p>
    Grading decisions will be made within reason. For example if you were assigned a task that is not clear, the project
    is disorganized, and the task owner is unresponsive then you might get credit for this requirement even if you don't
    complete the task. The course staff will use any available evidence when making these determinations.
</p>


== On-board Developer

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Do not add outside developers as collaborators on your repository! They must fork your repository instead.
</div>

<p>
    In this phase you will have developers outside of your team completing your tasks marked for outside help.
    It is the team's responsibility to on-board these developers and assist them as they navigate your code base. For
    questions specific to their assigned task the team member who created the task must assist the developer.
</p>

<p>
    Note that if your project is well-organized, your developer documentation is thorough, and your task a clear then
    this aspect of the phase can be easy. However, anything about the project or task that is not clear will create more
    work for you when you on-board this outside developer.
</p>


== Alpha Testing

<p>
    During this phase you will alpha test at least 3 projects. These projects are:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The project for which you are completing a task</li>
    <li>A project randomly assigned by the course staff</li>
    <li>A project of your choosing</li>
</ol>

<p>
    To alpha test a project you must first access the deployment of the project and run their software. This is similar
    to the Alpha Release jury duty, but now you are doing more than checking if the project enables the user
    story/stories. For alpha testing your goal is to provide valuable feedback to the development team that will help
    them improve their app. Throughout testing you should provide any information to the team that you think will help,
    though you must meet at least the following criteria.
</p>

<h5>Create a GitHub issue</h5>
<p>
    Create at least 1 GitHub issue in the repository of each tested project. If you find any bugs in the release you
    should create an issue for each bug (if the bug hasn't already ben reported). If you didn't find any bugs you can
    create an issue for a feature request. In either case, you must clearly mark whether your issue is a bug report or
    a feature request.
</p>

<h5>Feedback Form</h5>
<p>
    Complete the Alpha Tester feedback form of each tested project with details about your experience with the software.
</p>


== Alpha Release Maintenance

<p>
    Throughout this phase there will be alpha testers testing the alpha release of your project. You must be responsive
    to your testers and help them whenever it is requested. The team must be responsive to these tester on both GitHub
    and Gitter and help them test your project so they can provide feedback to the team.
</p>

<p>
    If a bug is reported by a tester, or anyone else, your team must respond by following the Hot Fix protocol. If the
    bug is preventing testers from accessing your software it must be fixed as soon as possible. For non-critical bugs
    you will have the full week as described in the protocol.
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
