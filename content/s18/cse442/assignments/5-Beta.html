== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Develop and release the beta version of your project with a complete MVP feature set and
    no major bugs. The release must be intuitive to use for a non-technical user.
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The software is easily accessed from the project's landing page</li>
    <li>The software is intuitive to use and provides the entire MVP feature set</li>
    <li>The software does not contain any major bugs</li>
</ol>


== Use Case Preparation

<div class="requirement alert alert-warning">
    Use case preparation will be presented as a lecture activity which is due Wednesday April 4th @ 11:59pm. As a beta
    release requirement it will be due Wednesday April 11th @ 11:59pm. If your team did not satisfactorily complete
    the lecture activity you will have a chance to revise your work before the second deadline to avoid a grade
    decrease.
</div>

<p>
    Describe 4 use cases for your project and provide testing procedures for 2 of them. This should all be added to a
    new wiki page titled "Beta Testing". These use cases will be tested
    by the 100-level students while they beta test your project. They will execute the testing procedures that you
    provide as well as execute their own testing procedures for the other 2 use cases.
</p>

<p>
    Each use case will be a specific set of actions that the user will take in your program as well as the expected
    outcome. These use cases will be assessed on the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>User Identification: Did you clearly identify the specific user for which this use case applies</li>
    <li>Related to description: Is the use case related to the description of your project (user story and feature set)
        in the readme of the project
    </li>
    <li>Non­Technical Presentation: Is the use case described appropriately for a non-technical audience</li>
    <li>Not ambiguous content: Is description of the use case clear with no room for interpretation</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the two testing procedures you will describe the specific ways that the use cases will be tested by your beta
    testers. The testing procedures will contain, and will be assessed based on, three separate sections:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Target: Clearly and specifically identify the aspect of the project being tested</li>
    <li>Testing Procedure: The procedure itself that will be followed by your beta testers. This should include all the
        specific steps to be followed during testing
    </li>
    <li>Expected Outcome: Clearly describe the expected behavior of the program after the testing procedure has been
        followed
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Use cases and testing procedures will be assessed by an outside party using this rubric
    (<a href="/static/UseCaseRubric.pdf">Grading Rubric</a>). If your team scores 1 or 2 on any of these criteria for
    any of your use cases or testing procedures your team will not earn credit for your submission.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>As a example suppose we are writing use cases for the search feature on Amazon, or any online retailer with a search
    feature.</p>

<p>
    Examples of use cases:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A use case that would receive all 4's on the rubric
        <ul>
            <li>
                "As a buyer I will type a product name into the site’s search bar and initiate a search by clicking on
                the magnifying glass symbol on the right side of the search bar to find the item I search for with the
                results sorted by how closely it is to what I typed for the search."
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A use case that would receive all 3's on the rubric
        <ul>
            <li>
                "As a user I will search for the product by initiating a search in the search bar and get results in an
                ordered list."
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A use case that would receive all 2's on the rubric
        <ul>
            <li>
                "I will use the search feature to look for an item I want to purchase and get back an ordered list from
                the search algorithm."
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A use case that would receive all 1's on the rubric
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Simply search for the item and, if you do it right, the algorithm will create a list of results."
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Example of a testing procedure that would receive all 4's
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Target:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The target is to test the process of searching for an item on Amazon using the name of the item as the
                search criteria.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Testing Procedure:
        <ul>
            <li>
                On the Amazon homepage (amazon.com) locate the search bar near the top of the screen. This will appear
                as a white rectangle where you can type and has a yellow box with a magnifying glass image on the right
                side of the bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                In this search bar, type the phrase "The Matrix", without quotes, then click on the yellow box with the
                magnifying glass image.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Expected Outcome:
        <ul>
            <li>
                After following the testing procedure the page should now show results based on your search with the
                most relevant product at the top of the page. Verify that the movie titled "The Matrix" is the top
                result and that the two following results are "The Matrix Reloaded" and "The Matrix Revolutions" in
                either order (ie. it doesn't matter which is second and which is third as long as these are the second
                and third results).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


== Develop Beta Release

<p>
    A non-technical user must be able to use the beta release of your software for the user story/stories of your
    project with all of your MVP features included and functional. For this release your software should be intuitive
    to use for a non-technical user.
</p>

<div class="requirement alert alert-info">
    Once the Beta version is complete, merge develop into master via a pull request and create a release from your
    master branch on GitHub as "v0.3.0"
</div>


== Deploy Beta Release

<p>
    The beta version of your software must be available and accessible to a non-technical user. Your beta release can
    replace your alpha release and must meet the same requirements except it will be provided to your users through
    a landing page.
</p>


== Landing Page

<p>
    Your beta release must be accompanied by a landing page for your project that includes instructions and details
    relevant to your beta
    testers. This site is separate from anything on the course website and you cannot assume visitors of this site know
    anything about your project. This implies that you cannot assume the users have seen any of your videos, though you
    can add any videos to your landing page if you want them to have that information.
</p>
<p>
    This is the site you should/will share with
    anyone interested in the project and it can be thought of as a poster advertising your project. You can include any
    additional information you'd like to this page, but for
    the beta release you are required to have at least the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of your project
    </li>
    <li>
        Instructions suitable for a non-technical user to access, run, and test your beta release
    </li>
    <li>
        A clearly indicated link to your beta testing feedback form
    </li>
    <li>
        A link to the issues page of your GitHub repository clearly marked as way to submit bug reports
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You should also add any additional information that is specific to your project such as specific bugs to look for,
    which features to test,
    special testing credentials, etc. The more information you provide to your testers and the more specific questions
    you ask them the more likely you are to receive meaningful feedback.
</p>

<p>
    *If your project is a web app the landing page can be the deployed app itself as long as it meets all the criteria
    of
    the landing page.
</p>

<p>
    To submit, add a link to you landing page in the readme of your repository.
</p>


== YouTube Video

<p>
    Upload a video demo of your beta release to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes. This video must give an
    accurate demo of the current state of your project and show your running software. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical language in this video.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Add a link to your video in your project's readme before the deadline. You may remove any links to previous videos
</p>


== Testing

<p>
    Although your testing at the team level will not be graded directly, you will be held
    accountable for any bugs or errors that appear in your released software. For your beta release there may be
    many
    minor bug reports (this is the purpose of beta testing), but you should not release your beta version with any major
    bugs or broken features. The bugs reported by beta testers should be such that they would have been very difficult
    to find in development.
</p>
<p>
    It is highly recommended that your team agrees on a robust testing
    methodology so you can release your software with confidence. In addition, robust testing will make code
    reviews much simpler for the team. At the very least, it will save the team a lot of time since you can limit the
    number of times you'll need to go through the Hot Fix protocol.
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
