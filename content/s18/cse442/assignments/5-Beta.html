== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Develop Beta Release: Develop the beta version of your project with a complete MVP feature set</li>
    <li>Deploy Beta Release: Deploy the beta version of your project for your beta testers</li>
    <li>Landing Page: Create a landing page for your project</li>
    <li>YouTube Video: Create and submit a YouTube video of your running software</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Develop and release the beta version of your project with a complete MVP feature set and
    no major bugs. The release must be intuitive to use for a non-technical user.
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The software is easily accessed from the project's landing page</li>
    <li>The software is intuitive to use and provides the entire MVP feature set</li>
    <li>The software does not contain any major bugs</li>
</ol>


== Develop Beta Release

<p>
    A non-technical user must be able to use the beta release of your software for the user story/stories of your
    project with all of your MVP features included and functional. For this release your software should be intuitive
    to use for a non-technical user.
</p>

<div class="requirement alert alert-info">
    Once the Beta version is complete, merge develop into master via a pull request and create a release from your
    master branch on GitHub as "v0.3.0"
</div>


== Deploy Beta Release

<p>
    The beta version of your software must be available and accessible to a non-technical user. Your beta release can
    replace your alpha release and must meet the same requirements except it will be provided to your users through
    a landing page.
</p>



== Landing Page

<p>
    Your beta release must be accompanied by a landing page for your project that includes instructions and details
    relevant to your beta
    testers. This site is separate from anything on the course website and you cannot assume visitors of this site know
    anything about your project. This implies that you cannot assume the users have seen any of your videos, though you
    can add any videos to your landing page if you want them to have that information.
</p>
<p>
    This is the site you should/will share with
    anyone interested in the project and it can be thought of as a poster advertising your project. You can include any
    additional information you'd like to this page, but for
    the beta release you are required to have at least the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of your project
    </li>
    <li>
        Instructions suitable for a non-technical user to access, run, and test your beta release
    </li>
    <li>
        A clearly indicated link to your beta testing feedback form
    </li>
    <li>
        A link to the issues page of your GitHub repository clearly marked as way to submit bug reports
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You should also add any additional information that is specific to your project such as specific bugs to look for,
    which features to test,
    special testing credentials, etc. The more information you provide to your testers and the more specific questions
    you ask them the more likely you are to receive meaningful feedback.
</p>

<p>
    *If your project is a web app the landing page can be the deployed app itself as long as it meets all the criteria of
    the landing page.
</p>

<p>
    To submit, add a link to you landing page in the readme of your repository.
</p>




== YouTube Video

<p>
    Upload a video demo of your beta release to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes. This video must give an
    accurate demo of the current state of your project and show your running software. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical language in this video.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Add a link to your video in your project's readme before the deadline. You may remove any links to previous videos
</p>



== Testing

<p>
    Although your testing at the team level will not be graded directly, you will be held
    accountable for any bugs or errors that appear in your released software. For your beta release there may be
    many
    minor bug reports (this is the purpose of beta testing), but you should not release your beta version with any major
    bugs or broken features. The bugs reported by beta testers should be such that they would have been very difficult
    to find in development.
</p>
<p>
    It is highly recommended that your team agrees on a robust testing
    methodology so you can release your software with confidence. In addition, robust testing will make code
    reviews much simpler for the team. At the very least, it will save the team a lot of time since you can limit the
    number of times you'll need to go through the Hot Fix protocol.
</p>



== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this submission</li>
</ol>
