== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Scheduling: As a class, determine the presentation schedule</li>
    <li>Presentation: Give a presentation of your project the CSE442 class (A technical audience)</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: The presentation undoubtedly meets the requirements and is presented in a clear
    and professional manner
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The presentation contained a clear description of the project</li>
    <li>The presentation showed an accurate live demo of the current software</li>
    <li>The presentation described the technical details of the project</li>
    <li>The presentation was professional</li>
</ol>


== Scheduling

<p>
    As part of the communication and teamwork component of this course, it is left to the class to schedule the team
    presentations. You have been working with your team members throughout the semester, working across teams during the
    collaboration phase, and interacting with alpha and beta testers. For this requirement the entire class will be
    working together to organize a fairly complex scheduling task. Very little, if any, help will be provided by the
    course staff regarding this task. As a class, you own the presentation logistics.
</p>


<p>
    While the schedule is left for the class to determine, the following criteria must be met for each presentation:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>All presentations must be scheduled at a time when the entire CSE442 class can attend. This effectively limits
        the scheduling to MWF @ 4-4:50pm and Friday May 18 @ 3:30PM - 6:30PM (our scheduled final exam time)</li>
    <li>Each scheduled presentation must make a minimum of 12 minutes available for the team to present (ie. No more
        than 4 presentations per lecture time, or 15 during the final exam time)</li>
    <li>A method must be in place to address teams that use more than their allotted time to ensure that the following
        teams have time to present. The course staff will not step in to prevent a team from taking too much time</li>
    <li>Unless stated otherwise, any lecture time can be scheduled for up to 4 presentations. If a certain lecture time
        cannot be used, the class will be notified with at least 1 week of notice</li>
    <li>Every student in CSE442 has jury duty for every presentation, except for their own team. Failure to attend and
        provide feedback for a presentation will result in a protocol violation</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note: that if your team/class fails to schedule a presentation you have not met this objective or the presentation
    objective and will earn 2 grade reductions for this phase.
</p>


== Presentation

<p>
    Your team will give a presentation of your project for a technical audience at your scheduled time. All team members
    must attend the presentation. The presentation will be assessed using the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of the project must be presented. Anyone in the audience with no prior knowledge
        about your work should get a clear idea of what your software does and what it accomplishes through the
        presentation alone.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must show a live working demo of the current version of your software.
    </li>
    <li>
        The technologies used to implement your project must be covered. Unlike the YouTube videos, you will get
        technical in your presentation. This does not have to be detailed, but it should give the audience an idea of
        how your project was implemented. For example, describe which languages, libraries, services, and frameworks you
        used and how they interact with each other. You do not need to show code in your presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The presentation must be executed professionally. There is no need to dress up, but you should be organized and
        well prepared before presenting. You should not be struggling with the projector, talking over your team
        members, figuring out what to say, debugging your demo, exceeding your scheduled time, etc during your
        presentation. Be prepared to show off your project.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Only team members in attendance for the presentation will receive the points above. Not all team members have to
    speak, but all need to be present and at the front of the room throughout the presentation.
</p>

<p>
    Note: Every student in the class has jury duty for every presentation. Failure to attend a presentation and provide
    feedback via the presentation jury duty form will result in a protocol violation
</p>



== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this submission</li>
</ol>
