== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Maintain your deployed software</li>
    <li>Address any bug reports</li>
    <li>Present your project</li>
</ul>


== Practical Objectives
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Responsive to communication through GitHub and Ryver.<hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that no bug reports have been made. Note that they will use discretion to
    determine if a report is an actual bug (example: a user filing a bug report that they prefer a green background is
    not an actual bug). They will also verify that the team is responsive to new issues, pull requests, messages on the
    team's public Ryver forum, or any other reasonable method of contact.<hr/>
    <b>Note</b>: There are 2 practicals objectives for this phase. Both must be met to earn a +1.
</p>
<hr/><hr/>
<p>
    <b>Objective 2</b>: The presentation undoubtedly meets the requirements below and is presented in a clear
    and professional manner.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will watch your presentation and determine if this objective was met. If there are
    any difficulties during the presentation, or if some parts were unclear then this objective has not been met.
    <hr/>
    <b>Note</b>: Feedback from students may be used as evidence for grading decisions, but will not directly
    determine any grades.
</p>
== Maintenance



<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: No major bug reports.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will determine if any bug reports are considered major. A major will be defined as a
    bug that prevents users from using your software for its intended purpose (ex. Not all features are functional)
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Interact with your users.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that the developers are interacting with users who contact them. This
    includes responding to bug reports, feature requests, comments on GitHub issues, and messages on the team's Ryver
    forum.
</div>

<p>
    Your deployed software must be available to users throughout this entire three week period. Users will expect your
    MVP and at least 1 add-on feature to be available and these features must work correctly for their intended purpose.
    Any issues with your software may be reported on GitHub issues and you must be responsive
    to any such issues. Users may be actively trying to break your software so watch for
    bug reports. Unlike the beta version, your released software is expected to be robust and bug free. If a bug does
    arise, the team must be responsive in addressing the issue and release an update if needed.
</p>


== Presentation



<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Present your project following all the requirements below.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will watch your presentation to verify that all criteria have been met.
</div>

<p>
    Your team must schedule a time to present your final project and present. All team members must attend the
    presentation. The presentation will be assessed using the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of the project must be presented. Anyone in the audience with no prior knowledge
        about your work should get a clear idea of what your software does and what it accomplishes through the
        presentation alone.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must show a live working demo of the official release of your software.
    </li>
    <li>
        The technologies use to implement your project must be covered. Unlike the YouTube videos, you will get
        technical in your presentation. This does not have to be detailed, but it should give the audience an idea of
        how your project was implemented. For example, describe which languages, libraries, services, and frameworks you
        used and how they interact with each other. You do not need to show code in your presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The presentation must be executed professionally. There is no need to dress up, but you should be organized and
        well prepared before presenting. You should not be struggling with the projector, talking over your team
        members, figuring out what to say, debugging your demo, exceeding your scheduled time, etc during your
        presentation. Be prepared to show off your project.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Only team members in attendance for the presentation will receive the points above. Not all team members have to
    speak, but all need to be present and at the front of the room throughout the presentation. If a group member is
    unable to
    attend the team presentation time please notify the course staff at least 24 hours <b>before</b> the presentation.
    Excuses given later will not be entertained unless there was a documented emergency.
</p>

<p>
    Note: As the lecture activities during this phase all students will be asked to rate the presentations.
