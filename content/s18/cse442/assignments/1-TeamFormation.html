== Project and Team Formation

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Form or join a team.
    <!--<hr/>-->
    <!--<b>Verify</b>: Your name will be listed on the project page for your team.-->

</p>

<p>
    You are free to choose your team and software project for this course. To help you find a project and team you can
    discuss
    ideas with other students in the course in the project ideas forum on Gitter. If you prefer to be placed in a random
    group, send an email to hartloff@buffalo.edu with "CSE442: Random Group" as
    the subject line before Friday on the first week of classes. So long as it is mathematically possible to place all such students into groups of size 3-5, all
    students making such requests will be placed into groups together instead of added to existing groups.
</p>

<p>
    Whatever you choose for your project and team you must fulfill the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Teams must have 3-5 members
    </li>
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Once your team is formed, create your project on the course website and fill in all required information-->
    <!--</li>-->
</ul>

<p>
    *The course staff reserves the right to reject any project idea that is too trivial for a senior level group
    project.
</p>

<hr/>
<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
<p>
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Form a team around a common interest or specific project idea. This course is much
    more enjoyable if the whole team is interested in the project.
</p>
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
<p>
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Use caution if forming a team with 3 members. If a member resigns the course you
    may need to disband
    and join other teams mid-semester. If you have 3 members, make sure all three are dedicated to completing the
    course.
</p>
<!--</div>-->

== Gitter

<p>
    If you are having trouble finding a team, please use gitter and start sharing ideas with other students.
</p>

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
    <!--<b>Requirement</b>: Create a public team forum and a private team channel.-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;<hr/>&ndash;&gt;-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;<b>Verify</b>: The river icon will appear on your project page which links to your public channel.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--We will use Ryver as the primary means of communication in this course (see syllabus for sign up link). For your-->
    <!--project you will need to create the following on Ryver:-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--A public forum and submit the channel name on the course web site under your project details. This forum-->
        <!--will be the primary means for anyone outside the team who wants to know about your project.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--A private team on Ryver and invite Jesse into your team. This team will be used to privately discuss any-->
        <!--grading decisions or other sensitive information with your group.-->
    <!--</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->


<!--== Repository-->

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
    <!--<b>Requirement</b>: Create a GitHub repository for your project.-->
    <!--<hr/>-->
    <!--<b>Verify</b>: A GitHub symbol will appear on your project page which links to your repository.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
    <!--<b>Requirement</b>: Add the course webhook to your repository and create an issue in GitHub.-->
    <!--<hr/>-->
    <!--<b>Verify</b>: The issue will appear on your project page.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Create a public repository on GitHub and submit the link in your project details. In addition, setup the course web-->
    <!--hook to send JSON for all-->
    <!--events and be sure that all team members add their GitHub id to their user profile on the course web site.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Webhook url: https://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/webhook-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<img src="/static/webhook_image.png" class="img-responsive"/>-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<p>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;If your project appears on the project page with a link to your repo then you did it right.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</p>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Once the webhook is setup, create your first issue in GitHub. This issue can be anything, but you should verify that-->
    <!--it appears on your project page. If it does not, re-check your webhook setup to find the error.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Team Contract-->

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
    <!--<b>Requirement</b>: Sign and submit a team contract.-->
    <!--<hr/>-->
    <!--<b>Verify</b>: Physically hand the signed contract to Jesse. The course staff will verify that all the required-->
    <!--content is in the contract and that it is signed by all team members.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;(Which tech, frameworks, how will they be combined, potential pitfalls and adjustments)&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--The team contract must be printed, signed by all team members, then submitted to the course instructor. This-->
    <!--contract will be kept on file and will be referenced throughout the semester. You are bound to this-->
    <!--contract and its contents will be used while making grading decisions. Any violations of this contract by a team-->
    <!--member may result in a grade reduction for that person. In this way, this contract can have an impact on your final-->
    <!--course grade so be careful about what you sign. It is recommended that you look through the-->
    <!--criteria for all 7 project submissions before finalizing your contract.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--If your group wishes to change your contract you can submit-->
    <!--a replacement as long as all team members agree to-->
    <!--and sign the new contract. These changes must be made in-between project submissions (ie. You can't redefine your-->
    <!--MVP the day before the MVP deadline).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<hr/>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--Your team contract must contain the following sections and details:-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
    <!--Project Outline-->
<!--</h4>-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<div class="alert alert-info">&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;<strong>Recommended</strong>: Look through the criteria for all 7 project submissions before finalizing your&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;contract.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</div>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Provide a high-level outline of your project and the technologies involved. This should give a clear idea of your-->
    <!--vision for the project and a general idea of how that vision will become a reality.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--In addition to the ideas and technologies, this section must clearly define your Minimum Viable Product-->
    <!--(MVP) and at least 3 potential add-on features that can be added to this MVP. By the end of the semester-->
    <!--you will be required to complete and deploy your MVP and at least one of these add-on features. Since only one-->
    <!--add-on features needs to be completed do not hesitate to list many difficult features here. All of these features-->
    <!--combined should-->
    <!--show the true potential that your project could become if you continue to develop it beyond the course requirements.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--<strong>MVP</strong>: As the name implies, when choosing your MVP you should choose the minimal amount of-->
    <!--functionality needed to deliver-->
    <!--a viable product. Think about the absolute minimal feature set that can still be useful to the end user and choose-->
    <!--that. Anything that isn't absolutely necessary for the project should be saved for your add-on features.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--<strong>Add-on Features</strong>: These are additional features that can expand your project. These-->
    <!--features must enable the end user to accomplish something that they could not do without it (ie. stylistic or-->
    <!--performance changes-->
    <!--will not count as add-on features in this course. They must add functionality for the end user).-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--<strong>User Stories</strong>: Your MVP and each add-on feature must have an accompanying user story. These user-->
    <!--stories must be non-technical descriptions of each feature from the users perspective. Each story must describe-->
    <!--something different that the user can accomplish with your software.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--<strong>Project Scope</strong>: As mentioned above, the course staff reserve the right to deny any project proposal-->
    <!--that is too trivial to justify a semester-long team project in a 400 level CSE course (ex. A desktop java app with-->
    <!--the scope of a CSE116 project). On the other side of this,-->
    <!--your team should be careful to not choose a project that is too difficult to complete in a single semester. If your-->
    <!--idea is very ambitious, don't put the whole project in your MVP. Identify a simple core in the-->
    <!--project and make that your MVP with everything else as add-on features. You must complete and release your MVP and-->
    <!--at least 1-->
    <!--add-on feature this semester so don't commit to more work than your team will be able to complete. Work on more-->
    <!--add-on features to complete the full vision if you have time.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--The projects chosen by each team will vary is size and scope making some projects more difficult than others. These-->
    <!--differences may be taken into consideration while grading, especially when assessing the practical-->
    <!--objectives.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<div class="alert alert-warning">&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;Create&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;complete the full vision if you have time.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</div>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<br/>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;<h4>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;Meetings&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</h4>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;<p>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;Protocols for meetings. All group member must meet at least once a week. Can have multiple meeting to get full&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;coverage if needed. Use the site to schedule these meetings. Official meetings must be held in Baldy 19.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</p>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
    <!--Team Roles-->
<!--</h4>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--With the project defined you will now divide the work of the project among your team members. It is highly-->
    <!--recommended that you take your time on this section and ensure that everyone is satisfied with their roles. If this-->
    <!--section is not clear it may cause severe stress later in the semester.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Each member of the team must have at least 1 role on the project for which they will responsible. Likewise, every-->
    <!--aspect of the project should have-->
    <!--a team member assigned to it. Any task that does not clearly belong to a team member is a potential source of-->
    <!--controversy. You are free to decide these roles, though keep in mind that these roles may be used to make grading-->
    <!--decisions. If one of your project submissions is unacceptable, an attempt will be made to identify which area of the-->
    <!--project is lacking. If it is very clear that a team member violated the team contract or neglected their area of the-->
    <!--project then they will receive a grade reduction.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<div class="alert alert-info">&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;<strong>Recommended</strong>: If your group is struggling to define these roles you can try the&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This provides 3 clear(ish) areas that can be assigned, or sub-divided.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</div>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--If your group is struggling to define these roles you can try the-->
    <!--Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This provides 3 clear(ish) areas that can be assigned or sub-divided.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Note that all team members might not have equal work to complete for each submission, but you should try to balance-->
    <!--the-->
    <!--amount of work done by each member throughout the semester. You should also look through all 7 project submissions-->
    <!--and make sure every aspect of the project is covered by a team member (ex. Who is responsible for deploying the-->
    <!--project).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
    <!--Reviewers-->
<!--</h4>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--In addition to every aspect of the project having a group member assigned to complete it, each aspect must have an-->
    <!--assigned reviewer on the team (different from the assigned member) who will review any code submitted in that area.-->
    <!--Every-->
    <!--member of the team must be a reviewer for at least one part of the project. You are-->
    <!--free to assign these-->
    <!--reviewers however you'd like even if it doesn't correspond directly to team roles. The-->
    <!--reviewer will perform the code reviews for any pull request made in this area and maintain the integrity of the-->
    <!--project. If the reviewer approves broken or buggy-->
    <!--code, they are responsible and may be held accountable in the form of a grade reduction.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--&lt;!&ndash;<div class="alert alert-info">&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;<strong>Recommended</strong>: You have a lot of freedom in this section and you should use this freedom wisely. From&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;a grading perspective, every piece of code submitted to your project must have 1 member assigned to it and another&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;member reviewing it. If any code is broken in a project submission, these two members will be in question.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</div>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<p>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;Each area of the project needs an assignee, and at least 1 reviewer. The assignee is doing the work and the&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;reviewers must&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;approve any pull request to develop. If things break, both are blamed (demerit). If the code sucks it's&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;the assignees fault, if it sucks and the pull request is approved it's also the reviewers fault. (My response when a&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;reviewer gets dinged? Where are your tests? Did you make sure the worker was testing? Why didn't you test?) Reviewer&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;should checkout the pull request and verify that it's in working condition. Pull request must be made with enough&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;time for review, and possibly multiple rounds of review. First week of a sprint for coding, second&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;week for review? Up to the group. Put your requirements in this document. Violate the document and you'll face a&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;grade reduction (In certain cases the whole group can decide that something was an acceptable violation).&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</p>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;<p>&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;Assign everything to at least one group member. This includes video submissions and documentation. If something is&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;missing or crappy,&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;the assigned member will take a hit. Try to balance all the work for each member. Note that not all members will do&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;equal work for each submission, but it should be close to equal throughout the whole semester. There might be some&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;negotiation here. [Can have a designated tester(s), though you can't blame them when your code sucks. Maybe they're&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;only blamed if they didn't open a bug ticket before the deadline]&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;</p>&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
    <!--Dispute resolution-->
<!--</h4>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--This section will detail the team's dispute resolution solution.-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;Disputes are bound to occur&ndash;&gt;-->
    <!--&lt;!&ndash;in any team. &ndash;&gt;-->
    <!--Team members might argue over frameworks, languages, who's responsible for a specific task, or even-->
    <!--whether to use tabs or spaces.-->
    <!--Anything that is not clearly defined in this contract has the potential to become a-->
    <!--dispute. You won't be able to predict every possible cause of a conflict later in the semester and add them all to-->
    <!--the-->
    <!--contract, but-->
    <!--you must outline a protocol that you will follow if a dispute does occur. This can be something ridiculous, fun,-->
    <!--serious, or whatever, but it must give a clear resolution. All members agree that this is the method that will be-->
    <!--used to resolve disputes and will-->
    <!--be bound to the results. This will-->
    <!--help the team move forward when a deadlock is reached and neither side is willing to move off their positions.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Some examples:-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Bring in a mediator (please define who will be the mediator)-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Compete in a game (winner gets to make the decision)-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Rock-paper-scissors or flip a coin (if you want random 50/50 decisions)-->
    <!--</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Whatever your team decides, it is recommended that you have fun with this section. You will be enforcing this-->
    <!--protocol at times of high stress when you will likely need some light-hearted fun.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
    <!--Additional Details-->
<!--</h4>-->
<!--<p>-->
    <!--The above are the minimum requirements for this document, but your team can add any other details that you'd like.-->
    <!--With the wide variety and unpredictability of the projects and teams in CSE442, the course itself has to be rather-->
    <!--vague since it must apply to every possible software project. This is-->
    <!--your opportunity-->
    <!--to add structure that is specific to you, your team, and your project. Within reason, this contract will be used to-->
    <!--make-->
    <!--grading decisions where the course leaves areas undefined. If a situation occurs that is not specified by the course-->
    <!--structure or the team contract a grading-->
    <!--decisions may be made at the instructor's discretion.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--As a concrete example, the course gives -1 to all team members if-->
    <!--a video submission is missing or doesn't meet the criteria for its submission, but if you state in this contract-->
    <!--that a specific team member is responsible for all video submissions then only that team member will receive a grade-->
    <!--reduction. Use this to your advantage to agree on, and clearly specify, exactly what each team member should-->
    <!--contribute to the project this semester.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Some examples of recommended additions:-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Assign the video, documentation, and other miscellaneous tasks to specific team members. If each team member's-->
        <!--role is very clearly defined it will limit disputes and stress later in the semester. Look through all the-->
        <!--phases of the project and try to cover every requirement.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
        <!--Specify a deadline for code submissions. The course structure allows students to submit a pull request right-->
        <!--at a deadline without recourse. This puts the code reviewer in a tough spot where they either have to trust the-->
        <!--author and-->
        <!--accept the code without review (risking their own grade) or refuse the request and potentially enter a dispute.-->
        <!--This can be avoided by requiring pull requests to be submitted with ample time for review.-->
    <!--</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->


<!--== Tasks-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Make sure everyone knows what to do for the prototype (assign tasks based on areas). Assign these tasks in GitHub.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Only 1 repo. If you're planning android/iOS/web, choose 1 as your course project and plan the others later or as-->
<!--add-ons. If you have an API backend it must be in the same repo as your client.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<p>-->
<!--Each member must be assigned an "area" of the project. Try your best to clearly define these areas and divide the-->
<!--work evenly across them. Every area must contribute significantly to the MVP. No one can have an add-on feature as-->
<!--an area. Be aware of how the work of an area is dived between the MVP and add-on features. Does someone have an area-->
<!--that doesn't need work after the MVP? Are you comfortable with that group member not doing much work after the MVP-->
<!--is released?-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Define as clearly as you can the boundaries between areas. Define the interfaces between them and code to the-->
<!--interfaces! This will save headaches while merging. This will make testing easier. This will make bugs easier to-->
<!--detect and fix. It allows team mates to work in parallel. Do this! At a loss for ideas? Start with MVC.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--We wont always check each individual contribution to the project, but if an area of the project is not working (and-->
<!--the rest is) then we know who is responsible. Set up the splits so a single team mate can't drag down the group.-->
<!--Ideally, a group member doesn't do their work.. don't stress, just get your stuff done and it will be clear who-->
<!--didn't work because their area will suck.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Groups can nominate an area as difficult. The member assigned to that area can get a gold star if everything is-->
<!--completed on time. 1 free, additional with approval. Caution for taking a very difficult project. This is a gamble.-->
<!--I need an A so I'm taking a difficult one. You're cool with a B? Take this easy area.-->
<!--</p>-->
