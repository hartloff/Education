== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Develop Alpha Release: Develop the alpha version of your project that enables your user story/stories</li>
    <li>Deploy Alpha Release: Deploy the alpha version of your project for your alpha testers</li>
    <li>Developer Documentation: Write documentation sufficient to on-board a new developer into your project</li>
    <li>Help Wanted Issues (Individual): Create an issue in your area of the project for an outside developer to
        complete
    </li>
    <li>YouTube Video: Create and submit a YouTube video of your running software</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Develop and release the alpha version of your project that enables your user story/stories with
    no critical bugs. The release must be accessible to a non-technical user.
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>As a non-technical user I was able to easily run/start the software</li>
    <li>As a technical user I was able to use this release for the user story/stories of this project</li>
    <li>The "help wanted" tasks have an appropriate scope and are clearly described</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note that the last criteria assesses individual work. If the team has a low score in this criteria the course staff
    will determine which task(s) caused the low score. If the project has great scores for the first 2 criteria the team
    members with appropriate and clear tasks will still meet the practical objective while the members with the
    offending tasks will not.
</p>

== Develop Alpha Release

<p>
    A user must be able to use the alpha release of your software for the
    user story/stories of your project. The alpha release does not have to contain your entire MVP feature set, however
    the missing features cannot be on the "critical path" since this release must still enable your user story/stories.
    Any MVP features that are missing must have GitHub issues created for them. These features must be completed before
    the beta release.
</p>

<p>
    For the alpha release you can assume that your users (alpha testers) are technically inclined. It is acceptable if
    user experience is not very intuitive to a general audience, but a technical user (your fellow CSE442 classmates)
    should be able to figure out how to use the software.
</p>

<div class="requirement alert alert-info">
    Once the Alpha version is complete, merge develop into master via a pull request and create a release from your
    master branch on GitHub as "v0.2.0"
</div>


== Deploy Alpha Release

<p>
    The alpha version of your software must be available and accessible to a non-technical user. Note the distinction
    that once your software is running you can assume your users are technically inclined, but a non-technical user
    must be able to run/start your software. This requirement will be different depending on each project. Deployment
    strategies for several
    primary categories are given below. If you feel your project does not fit into one of these categories please
    contact the course staff and we can discuss your specific deployment strategy.
</p>

<h5>Web Application</h5>

<p>
    If your project is a web application it must be deployed and running on a server that is accessible from any
    Internet connected device that is running a major browser (Chrome, FireFox, etc). You are responsible for finding a
    server where you can host your app. There are several free options available that you can use.
</p>

<p>
    When deploying a web application you must <strong>ensure that you app is secure</strong>. This includes protecting
    your site from attacks that can break its functionality or any way for an attacker to obtain any data of your users
    that should be protected (Ex. An attacker must not be able to log in as one of your users). We will cover securing
    a web app in lecture before this release is due.
</p>

<h5>Platform Specific Application</h5>

<p>
    This includes any app that targets a specific platform that is commonly available including Windows, OSX, Linux,
    iOS,
    and Android. Note that this includes both desktop and mobile apps. To deploy these apps you must provide a single
    executable file that can be ran on the target platform -or- release your app through an official distribution
    channel (Ex. Windows store, app store, play store). If the app is not released in an official store, a user
    should be able to download the single file and run/install your software without any addition steps.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to providing an executable or adding your software to a store you must also have a device available
    for your testers to use that has your app installed. This will be necessary when you have an assigned tester who
    does not have access to your target platform. In addition, if your app is not release in an official store you
    must have this device available to <strong>all</strong> of your testers. This is for security reasons so they are
    not installing an arbitrary executable on their own device.
</p>

<h5>Hardware Application</h5>

<p>
    A hardware application project is one that requires special hardware that is not commonly available to most users.
    This includes projects that require specialized devices (Ex. Hololens, VR headset, xbox, myo armband, smart watch)
    or hardware that was custom built for the project. To deploy such a project you can include instructions in your
    readme that are simple for non-technical user to follow and run the app assuming they have all the required
    hardware. This should be as simple as possible for your given use case.
</p>

<p>
    Since your testers may not have access to the required hardware you must provide times where you provide a hands on
    demo for your testers. A reasonable effort must be made to provide an opportunity for all testers to use your
    software. Lecture time can be scheduled for this purpose.
</p>


== Developer Documentation

<p>
    During the next phase of the project you will be completing a task for another team in the course, and your class
    mates will be completing tasks for your team. To facilitate this you must prepare your project for the on-boarding
    process and make it possible, preferably simple, for a developer to visit your project and contribute code. At the
    end of the next phase you will be assessed based on how difficult or easy it was for someone to contribute to your
    project. As with many aspects of this course, submitting quality work in this section will save you time, and
    possibly your grade, later in the course.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
    Write your developer documentation in your GitHub wiki. This documentation must outline the structure of your code
    and provide everything needed for a new developer to join the team. An
    outside developer who is unfamiliar with the project should be able to contribute code to your project after reading
    the wiki without having to contact the team (Though they can, and should, contact the team via your Gitter
    community).
</p>


<br/>
<h4>Code Organization</h4>
<p>
    Your code itself should also be easy to follow and well-organized. Simplicity is critical here. Meaningful naming,
    comments where needed, intuitive directory structure, etc. Try to imagine looking at your repository for the first
    time. Does it make sense? Is it confusing? Are there things that would need explaining? If so, adjust as needed.
</p>


== Help Wanted Issues (Individual)

<p>
    Each team member must create an issue in your repo to be completed by a student outside your group during the next
    phase of the project and tagged with the "help wanted" tag. Each issue should be related to the creators area of the
    project according to your team roles. Be sure that these tasks are clearly defined. Note that you cannot have 1 team
    member create all these
    issues. When these tasks are assigned each student will be given a GitHub username and they will find their assigned
    task by finding a "help wanted" issue created by that user.
</p>
<p>
    The tasks created for outside developers do not have to be substantial, but they must have some impact on your
    final product (Ex. adding comments or documentation is not acceptable).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Recommended</strong>: Write tests for the tasks that will be completed by outside help to make it absolutely
clear what needs to be accomplished.
</p>

== YouTube Video

<p>
    Upload a video demo of your alpha release to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes. This video must give an
    accurate demo of the current state of your project and show your running software. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical language in this video.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Add a link to your video in your project's readme before the deadline. You may remove the link to your prototype
    video
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
