-snag submissions
-tell me what new tech you've learned
-ethics discussions
-impact discussions
-legal discussions
-guest speakers and panels
-individual presentation (teach us something you've learned) (should be vetted. Give the presentation to me for approval) (maybe they apply and interview for the spots! No fixed number of spots so it's not a curve)


== Objectives

<ul>
    <li>Learn and apply various principles of software engineering</li>
    <li>Explore non-technical aspects of software engineering</li>
    <!--<li>(e) An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities</li>-->
    <!--<li>(g) An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society</li>-->
</ul>

== Lecture

<p>
    Many lectures will involve interactive activities. These activities are designed to help you understand and apply
    various aspects of software engineering. In addition, we will explore software engineering as a whole and discuss
    it's role
    in society.
</p>

<p>
    These activities will be self-contained in lecture and you must attend lecture to earn credit for them.
    <!--Attempting to earn credit for an activity without being physically present in lecture is an-->
    <!--academic integrity violation and [if caught] will result in a F in the course. A variety of methods will be used to-->
    <!--detect violators. Do not test this unless you are comfortable with an F in the course.-->
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Each activity is graded on a binary scale. You either completed the activity, or you didn't. The effect on your
    final grade will be determined by the number of activities you didn't complete.
</p>


<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny text-center">
    <tr>
        <td>Incomplete Activities</td>
        <td>Grade Change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1-3</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4-5</td>
        <td>-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6-7</td>
        <td>-2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8+</td>
        <td>-3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    *If the response rate on the course evaluations is at least 98%, all cutoff values for incomplete activities will be
    increased by 1. This would mean that missing 0-1 activities would result in +1, miss 2-4 for 0, etc.
</p>

== Make Up

<p>
    For each activity there will be a make up opportunity for any student who <b>attended lecture</b> and attempted the
    activity, but was unable to successfully complete it. No make ups will be given to student who either missed
    lecture, or were present but did not make an honest effort to complete the activity.
</p>

<p>
    Make ups will also be available for anyone with an excused absence. Excused absences <b>must</b> be supported with
    official documentation (doctor's note, police report, athletic schedule). No undocumented excuses will be
    entertained.
</p>

<p>
    The intent of these activities is to further your understanding of software engineering, not cause stress
    about completing each activity. Take your time, relax, and use the make up opportunities if needed.
