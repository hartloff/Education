== Objective
<ul>
    <li>Complete an MVP</li>
</ul>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: The MVP is bug-free and intuitively delivers the MVP functionality to a non-technical
    user.
<hr/>
<b>Verify</b>: After following the readme instructions (see below), if the software is running it will be tested for
this objective. The running software then must be intuitive to use for a non-technical user. Such a user must be
able to use the software for its intended MVP user story without any instruction or documentation outside of the
software itself (intuitive to use). Then, the course staff will search for bugs in the software and try to break
this release. If any bugs are found (excluding extremely trivial or obscure bugs) then this objective has not been met.
</p>

== Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Develop functional software that is ready for use for the MVP user story.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will verify that your software delivers the MVP functionality stated in the team
    contract.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release from the develop branch of your MVP on GitHub as "v0.2.0"
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page.
</div>

<p>
    For this submission you implement the MVP functionality for your project. At this point the project does not have to
    be aesthetically pleasing, but it MUST be functional and usable. A user must be able to use your software for the
    MVP user story stated in the team contract. No add-on features are required. Note that the specific requirements for
    this phase of the project depend greatly on you specific project and team contract.
</p>

<p>
    To finalize your MVP it must be merged into your develop branch and be tagged as release "v0.2.0" on GitHub.
</p>

== Readme

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Write a readme for your project with instruction for running your software.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will follow the readme <b>exactly</b> and check if your software runs after the
    instructions have been followed.
</div>

<p>
    Write a readme for your project describing how to run your software. You can assume your
    readers have technical experience. You should include any relevant
    instructions such as installing dependencies, how to compile/run the code, and any platform on which the software
    and
    readme will or will
    not work (ex. Don't assume Windows users can run apt-get. However, it's ok to specify that the instructions are only
    for *nix systems). Do not skip any details needed for a
    programmer to get from cloning your repo to running your software
    <!--(don't forget the basics like installing Node or a JVM)-->
    . You do not need to include instructions about
    using your software once it's running.
</p>

== YouTube Video
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your MVP to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements.
</div>
<p>
    As with the prototype, you must also complete a video demo of your MVP and upload it to YouTube. This video must
    show a working demo of all features in your MVP as described in your team contract. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes. The goal is
    to quickly demo your functioning software to the end users.
</p>

<h4>
    Submission

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your MVP video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that the video is displayed properly.
