== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Lab Session: Host a beta testing session with students in a 100-level CSE course</li>
    <li>Beta Release Maintenance: Communicate with your beta testers and fix any reported bugs</li>
    <li>Official Release: Develop and deploy the official release of your software</li>
    <li>YouTube Video: Create and submit a YouTube video of your software</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Deploy intuitive and bug-free software
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The software is intuitive to use and provides the entire MVP feature set</li>
    <li>The software is bug-free, or only contains trivial bugs</li>
</ol>


== Lab Session

<p>
    On the week of April 16, the first week of this phase, your team will host a beta testing session in a 2 hour lab
    of a 100-level CSE course. You must have at least 2 team members in the lab for entire lab time. You may switch
    team members throughout the lab (ex. You have a team of 4 and 2 of you can only make the first hour and the other 2
    can only make the second hour you can swap at the 1 hour mark and still have full coverage). In this lab session you
    team must complete the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Give a 5-10 minute non-technical presentation at the start of the session to briefly introduce your project, the user
        story/stories, the landing page, how to run the software, and how to submit feedback to the team</li>
    <li>Provide ample time and means for all the students to beta test your project. You must provided any required
        hardware or devices at this point. If you project is a web app with login and you don't have a beta testing account
        setup you must provide a machine that is logged in to your app for the testers to use. After they test your
        software, make sure they fill out your beta testing feedback form</li>
    <li>Give a 30-minutes "low-tech" presentation describing how you built your project. You can only assume that your
        audience has very basic programming and computer knowledge and your presentation must be directed at this
        audience. The goal of this presentation is to give them an idea of how they could create such a
        project. Note that taking them from their current level to being able to complete your project in reality will
        take years of training. If you are having trouble filling 30 minutes you are doing something wrong</li>
</ul>

<p>
    More details and requirements about this experience may be provided in lecture as we approach April 16.
</p>

== Beta Release Maintenance

<p>
    Throughout this phase there will be beta testers testing the beta release of your project. You must be responsive
    to your testers and help them whenever it is requested. The team must be responsive to these tester on both GitHub
    and Gitter and help them test your project so they can provide feedback to the team.
</p>

<p>
    If a bug is reported by a tester, or anyone else, your team must respond by following the Hot Fix protocol. If the
    bug is preventing testers from testing your full feature set (Critical or major bug) it must be fixed as soon as
    possible. For minor bugs you will have the full week as described in the protocol.
</p>



== Official Release

<p>
    In addition to all the requirements for your beta release, the official release must incorporate at least 1 feature
    request that has been suggested during your 100-level lab session. It is up to your team decide which idea to
    implement as long as it meets the following criteria:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>There is documentation that the feature was suggested by at least 1 beta tester from a 100-level student in
        your beta testing lab session</li>
    <li>The feature was not planned or requested before it was suggested by the beta tester(s).
        This excludes any stated add-on features or previous feature requests</li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you feel that none of the suggestions meet this criteria you should notify the course staff immediately so we
    can decide on a resolution.
</p>

<p>
    Use the "enhancement" tag on any GitHub issues related to this feature so the course staff can identify the code
    related to this feature. If you team has already been using this tag for other issues we may contact you on Gitter
    to check which issues are related to this requirement.
</p>

<p>
    Once the additional feature has been added, update all documentation to reflect the state of your official release.
    Revise the readme, wiki, and landing page as needed.
</p>


<div class="requirement alert alert-info">
    Once the official release is complete, merge develop into master via a pull request and create a release from your
    master branch on GitHub as "v1.0.0"
</div>

<p>
    For the 1 week following this deadline (the last week of classes) you must maintain your official release by being
    responsive to users and addressing any bug reports. After Friday, May 11 @ 4pm you no longer need to maintain your
    released software for the course, though you certainly should continue to maintain your project.
</p>

== YouTube Video

<p>
    One last video. There are no time or content requirements for this final video. You decide how you want to present
    your final product to the world. This is the last video submission so this is the one you will want to show to
    friends, family, and potential employers. Your future self will thank the team if this video is well made.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Add a link to your video in your project's readme before the deadline. You may remove any links to previous videos
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
