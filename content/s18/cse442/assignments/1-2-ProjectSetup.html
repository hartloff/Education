<!--== Objectives-->
<!--<ul>-->
<!--<li>Form a team</li>-->
<!--<li>Choose a project</li>-->
<!--<li>Setup the project structure</li>-->
<!--<li>Write a team contract</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Gitter: Create public and Private Gitter rooms for the project</li>
    <li>Repository: Create a public GitHub repository for your project and add the course webhook</li>
    <li>Project Description: Write a project description</li>
    <li>User Story: Write a user story</li>
    <li>Team Roles: Define roles for each team member</li>
    <li>Dispute Resolution Protocol: Write a method of conflict resolution</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Clearly define the goal of your project and how your teams intends to complete it
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>The project idea is clearly conveyed in the readme</li>
    <li>The user story conveys the project idea to a non-technical audience from the users perspective</li>
    <li>The team member roles are clearly defined and unambiguous</li>
</ol>

== Gitter

<p>
    We will use Gitter as the primary means of communication in this course (see syllabus for sign up link). For your
    project you will need the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Create a Gitter community for your repository and add the Gitter badge to your readme. This community must have
        at least one public room where anyone interested in your project can contact you. All members of your team must
        be in this room and responsive to messages sent to them
    </li><!--
    <li>
        Create a private private room on your Gitter community and invite Jesse (@hartloff) into this room. This
        room will be used to privately discuss any grading decisions or other sensitive information with your group
    </li>-->
</ul>

<p>
    Note that this community is separate from the CSE442 Gitter community. The CSE442 community will be used for course
    level conversation while you will maintain your own community for conversations about your project.
</p>

== Repository

<p>
    Create a public repository for your project on GitHub. In addition, setup the course web
    hook to send JSON for all events
    <!--and be sure that all team members add their GitHub id to their user profile on the course web site.-->
</p>

<p>
    Webhook url: https://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/webhook
</p>

<img src="/static/webhook_image.png" class="img-fluid"/>

<!--<p>-->
<!--If your project appears on the project page with a link to your repo then you did it right.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Once the webhook is setup, create your first issue in GitHub. This issue can be anything, but you should verify that-->
<!--it appears on your project page. If it does not, re-check your webhook setup to find the error.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<li>Write a project description</li>-->
<!--<li>Write a user story</li>-->
<!--<li>Define roles for each team member</li>-->
<!--<li>Write a method of conflict resolution</li>-->

== Project Description

<p>
    Provide a high-level outline of your project in the readme of your repository. This should give a clear idea of the
    vision for the project and a general idea of how that vision will become a reality. While writing this description
    keep you ideas separated into the following two categories/sections:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>MVP</strong>: As the name implies this is the minimal feature set needed to deliver
        a viable product. Think about the absolute minimal feature set that can still be useful to the end user and that
        is
        your MVP. This MVP feature set must be completed this semester so be careful what you put here. Though remember
        that
        you can change this after each project deadline so there's not too much harm in choosing a large MVP early.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Add-on Features</strong>: These are additional features that can expand your project into it's full
        potential. The MVP combined with all add-on features should represent the full vision of what this project could
        become. Describe as many add-on features as necessary to describe your vision, but you must have at least
        <strong>3
            add-on features</strong> list in your readme. Note that you will not be required to implement any of these
        add-on
        features for the course so don't be afraid to think big.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>
    Project Scope: As mentioned in lecture, the course staff reserve the right to deny any project proposal
    that is too trivial to justify a semester-long team project in a 400 level CSE course (ex. A desktop java app with
    the scope of a CSE116 project will be denied). In addition, the scope of each project will be taken into
    consideration when making decisions about the practical objectives. For example, a very simple project that is just
    ok might not earn a practical objective while an ambitious project that has some flaws may meet the objective.
</p>

== User Story

<p>
    The readme for you project must also contain a user story for your MVP feature set. This story must be written in
    the perspective of the user and must be written in plain English (No technical language). This story describes the
    use case of the
    user and reflects what the user is trying to accomplish. The focus of this story is on the task that needs to be
    accomplished and not the solution for that task.
</p>


== Team Roles

<p>
    Create a wiki for your project on GitHub and add a page named "Team Roles" that will define what each team member
    will be responsible to accomplish on your project. These roles must also include which team member will reviewing
    submitted code. You are free to choose your roles and who will review what code, but everything should be clearly
    defined and leave no ambiguity. When a new task needs to be completed it should be clear which one team member
    should be
    assigned to the task by referring to this page. These roles may be used during individual grading when necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Since you will likely know more about your roles on the project
    as the semester progresses you should revisit these roles after each project submission and
    revise them if necessary.
</p>

== Dispute Resolution Protocol

<p>
    You team must sign (with ink) and submit a paper copy of your team's dispute resolution protocol. This will be
    submitted during lecture on the due date for this submission.
</p>

<p>
    Team members might argue over frameworks, languages, who's responsible for a specific task, or even
    whether to use tabs or spaces.
    Anything that is not clearly defined by the course or the project has the potential to become a
    dispute. You won't be able to predict every possible cause of a conflict later in the semester, but
    you must outline a protocol that you will follow if a dispute does occur. This can be something ridiculous, fun,
    serious, or whatever, but it must give a clear resolution. All members agree that this is the method that will be
    used to resolve disputes and will
    be bound to the results. This will
    help the team move forward when a deadlock is reached and neither side is willing to move off their positions.
</p>

<p>
    Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bring in a mediator (please define who will be the mediator)
    </li>
    <li>
        Compete in a game (winner gets to make the decision)
    </li>
    <li>
        Rock-paper-scissors or flip a coin (if you want random 50/50 decisions)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Whatever your team decides, it is recommended that you have fun with this section. You will be enforcing this
    protocol at times of high stress when you will likely need some light-hearted fun.
</p>




== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
