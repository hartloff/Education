== Requirements

<ol>
    <li>Prototype: Develop a running prototype of you project and create a release on GitHub</li>
    <li>YouTube Video: Create an submit a YouTube video of your running software</li>
</ol>


== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Develop a running prototype that, by itself (no documentation or video required),
    clearly and simply conveys the idea of the final product to a non-technical audience. The prototype must also be
    easy to run for a technical user following instructions provided in the readme for the project (The readme can link
    to other resources)
<hr/>
<b>Criteria</b>:

</p>
<ol>
    <li>As a technical user, it was easy to run the software by following the readme instructions</li>
    <li>As a non-technical user, the running software alone gave me a clear understanding of the purpose of this
        software
    </li>
</ol>


== Prototype

<p>
    Develop a running prototype of your project that shows the idea of the final
    product. The idea of the project must be shown through the software alone with no supporting documentation. For
    example, you cannot assume that the users have read your readme, wiki, or watched your video.
</p>


</div>
<div class="requirement alert alert-info">
    Once your prototype is complete, create a release from the develop branch of your prototype on GitHub as "v0.1.0"
</div>


<p>
    No functionality is required at this point and most of the focus will be on the visuals and user interface. For
    example, you might have buttons that do
    not perform any actions, but it should be clear what the button will do after the software is developed and
    released. This
    prototype will become your final product by the end of the semester after your team implements all the
    functionality.
</p>


== YouTube Video

<p>
    Upload a video demo of your prototype to YouTube that is shorter than 1 minute. This video must give an accurate
    demo of the current state of your
    project and show the running prototype. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience to give people
    an idea of what you are going to accomplish this semester. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 1 minute. The goal is
    to quickly communicate your idea to an end user who may not be to run your software themselves.
</p>

== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this
        submission
    </li>
</ol>
