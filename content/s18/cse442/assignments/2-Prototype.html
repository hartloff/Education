== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Develop a prototype</li>
    <li>Effectively use git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Perform code reviews</li>
    <li>Work as a team</li>
</ul>

== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Develop a running prototype that, by itself (no documentation or video required),
    clearly and simply conveys
    the idea
    of the final product to a non-technical audience. The prototype must also be easy to run for a technical user.
    Instructions for running must be provided in the readme for the project (see the readme requirement of the MVP
    phase).
<hr/>
<b>Verify</b>: The course staff will "spin up" your prototype by following the readme and a non-technical user
may be given the prototype and asked what it is supposed to accomplish. The users description must match the stated
idea for the project, within reason. The non-technical user will not be given any
information outside of your prototype (They will not be shown the readme, prototype video, project page, etc. Only
the running code). If there is any difficulty at all in this process then this requirement is not met.
<hr/>
<b>Note</b>: Practical objectives will be very difficult to achieve throughout this course. Final grading decisions
will be
made by the course instructor and these decisions will be strict. Close does not count for these objectives.

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Develop a running prototype of your project that shows the idea of the final
    product.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that the prototype accurately shows your project idea. This verification is
    much less strict than the corresponding practical objective and may be checked through your video without running
    your prototype (ie. no readme required).
</div>
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release from the develop branch of your prototype on GitHub as "v0.1.0"
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page.
</div>

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
<!--<b>Technical Requirement</b>: Follow all the procedures for code contributions.<hr/>-->
<!--<b>Verify</b>: Follow the procedure. Branch, work, pull request, code review, merge.-->
<!--</div>-->


<p>
    In this phase your team will develop a prototype of your project. This prototype will be working software that runs
    and gives the customer a clear vision of your final product. No
    functionality is required and most of the focus will be on the visuals. For example, you might have buttons that do
    not perform any actions, but it should be clear what the button will do after the software is developed and
    released. This
    prototype will become your final product by the end of the semester after your team implements all the
    functionality.

    <!--Team members responsible for the view and-->
    <!--architecture may have more work than other members at this stage. Back-end team members can treat this as 4 weeks to-->
    <!--deliver the MVP.-->
</p>

<p>
    To finalize the prototype it must be merged into your develop branch and be tagged as release "v0.1.0" on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
    Note that any code contributed to the project must be made following the proper procedures. For code contributions
    this involves creating a feature branch off of develop, writing and testing the code, creating a pull request with
    the
    appropriate reviewer assigned, reviewing the code, and merging the code into the develop branch. This procedure will
    be
    covered in more detail in lecture. Any team member not following this and other procedures will receive a grade
    reduction.
</p>

<!--<p>-->
<!--Each individual effort doesn't have to be substantial, but the processes needs to be followed! This sprint is mostly-->
<!--about process.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Recommended: Have one group member build the base of the program and establish develop/master before the rest of the-->
<!--group starts creating feature branches. This will make the pull requests and reviews much simpler.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Version Control-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Recommended: Create test repositories and play around with git/GitHub features. Don't break the team repo.-->
<!--</p>-->


== YouTube Video

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your prototype to YouTube that is shorter than 1 minute.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements.
</div>
<p>
    In addition to creating a release on GitHub you will also produce a video demo of your prototype and upload it to
    YouTube. This video must give an accurate demo of the current state of your
    project and show the running prototype. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience to give people
    an idea of what you are going to accomplish this semester. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 1 minute. The goal is
    to quickly communicate your idea to the end users.

<h4>
    Submission

    Once complete, submit the link to your prototype video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that
    the video is displayed properly.
