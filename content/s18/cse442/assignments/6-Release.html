== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Release version 1.0</li>
    <li>Finalize the project and deployment</li>
    <li>Finalize documentation</li>
    <li>Release video</li>
    <li>You are held strongly accountable for your product after this</li>
</ul>

== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Deploy intuitive and bug-free software with a professional landing page.
<hr/>
<b>Verify</b>: The landing page and software are designed for a non-technical audience. A non-technical user can be
given a link to the landing page with no additional information and successfully use your software for its intended
purpose. This implies that the landing page and software are intuitive to navigate and use. If any bugs are found
(excluding extremely trivial or obscure bugs) then this objective has not been met.
<hr/>
<b>Note</b>: This objective is similar to the the beta release practical objective except your add-on feature must
also meet these standards and only very minor bugs are allowed. Likewise, feedback from student users may be used as
evidence for grading decisions, but will not directly determine any grades.
</p>
== Official Release


<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Deploy your software for non-technical users.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: A non-technical user must be able to access and use your software for
    its intended purpose. This will replace your beta deployment.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release from the master branch of your software on GitHub as "v1.0.0"
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Landing page and all documentation is updated to reflect the feature set in the
    official release.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that the updates have ben made.
</div>

<p>
    Complete your project, release it as "v1.0.0" on GitHub from the master branch, and maintain a live deployment of
    your software. You will
    release your software with the add-on feature completed in the previous phase which will replace your beta release.
    This will be the official release of your software and the last release for this course. For the remainder of the
    semester you must maintain this release and support your users.
</p>

<!--<p>-->
<!--Address any bug reports created by beta testers. Make sure everything is functional for this release.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    For the official release, all documentation must be current and clear. Revise the readme, wiki, and landing page as
    needed.
</p>

<p>
    Note that if your team has been completing all project tasks throughout the semester this might be a relaxing 2
    weeks.
</p>


== Release Video

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your official release to YouTube.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page.
</div>

<p>
    One last video. No time or content requirements this time. You decide how you want to present your final product to
    the world. This is the
    last video submission so this is the one you will want to show to potential employers. Your future self will thank
    the team if this video is great.
</p>

<form action="/courses/cse442-f17/submit-video/official" method="post">
    <div>
        <label>Video Link:</label>
        <input type="text" name="link"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
    </div>
</form>

<!--= Release Video (4 Points)-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Upload a video about your software. There is no time criteria for this video. There are no requirements for what-->
<!--needs to be contained in this video. As long as a video is uploaded, these 4 points will awarded to the group.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--You are encouraged to put time and thought into how you present this version of your software to the world. This-->
<!--video is a representation of your group and the work you have completed this semester. It can be a powerful tool-->
<!--while-->
<!--networking and searching for jobs to show other what you're capable of accomplishing as part of a team (which is-->
<!--what companies want to hire you to do). The grading criteria will step out of the way here so you can choose how you-->
<!--want to-->
<!--present your work, and yourselves, to others in the technical industry.-->
<!--</p>-->



== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this submission</li>
</ol>
