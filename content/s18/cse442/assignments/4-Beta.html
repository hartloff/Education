== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Release your software for beta testing</li>
    <li>Write documentation for beta testers</li>
    <li>Test your software</li>
    <li>Develop a landing page for the project</li>
    <li>Prepare on boarding documentation and tasks</li>
</ul>

== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Deploy intuitive software with a professional landing page.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The landing page and software must be designed for a non-technical audience. A non-technical user can be
    given a link to the landing page with no additional information and successfully use your software for its intended
    purpose and report testing feedback. This implies that the landing page and software are intuitive to navigate and
    use. There cannot be issues with the beta testing and no unnecessary confusion among the beta testers.
    <hr/>
    <b>Note</b>: This objective may be assessed throughout beta testing and grading decisions may not begin until the end
    of the collaboration phase. There may be a large number of beta testers using your software throughout this phase.
    Feedback from beta testers may be used as evidence for grading decisions, but will not directly
    determine any grades.
</p>

== Beta Release




<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Deploy your software for beta testers.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: A non-technical user must be able to access and use your software for
    its intended purpose and provide feedback to your team. These users will not follow your readme or install your
    project from the source code. You must provide a deployment appropriate for your project (ex. Downloadable
    executables, deployed on a web server, available in an app store, etc).
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release from the master branch of your Beta version on GitHub as "v0.3.0"
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page.
</div>

<p>
    In this phase you will prepare a release of your software for non-technical beta testers. For this release you
    cannot assume your users can follow the technical readme and will not install your project from the source code.
    This means your project must be deployed in a manner appropriate for your project. Examples of a deployment include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Host your software as a web app</li>
    <li>Host binaries or installers available for download for a major platform (ex. Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, android,
        iOS).
    </li>
    <li>Submit your software to be freely available on a public platform (ex. Play store, Steam, Kongregate). Note that
        this is very risky since your submission must be available by the end of this phase so you must submit early and
        hope for quick approval.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you are not sure what is considered a deployment for your specific project please contact the course staff
    immediately to avoid confusion near the deadline.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, the beta version of your project must be merged into your <b>master branch</b> and be tagged as release
    "v0.3.0" on GitHub.
</p>


== Landing Page

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a landing page for your project designed for non-technical users.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: On your project page, your project name will become a link to this landing page. Course staff will
    verify that this page contains the required content.
</div>

<!--<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">-->
<!--<b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a Google form where beta testers will submit feedback to you.-->
<!--<hr/>-->
<!--<b>Verify</b>:-->
<!--</div>-->

<p>
    Your beta release must be accompanied by a landing page for your project that includes instructions relevant to beta
    testers. This site is separate from anything on the course website and you cannot assume visitors to this site know
    anything about your project. This implies that you cannot assume the users have seen any of your videos, though you
    can add any videos to your landing page.
</p>
<p>
    This is the site you should/will share with
    anyone interested in the project and it can be thought of as a poster advertising the project. You can include any
    additional information you'd like to this page, but for
    the beta release you are required to have at least the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of your project
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe how a non-technical user can access your deployed software
    </li>
    <!--<li>-->
    <!--A clearly indicated link to a Google form where beta testers will submit feedback.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <li>
        The method for reporting bugs to the team (Bugs must be reported through GitHub issues on your project's
        repository). Your team can add any additional steps you'd like your beta testers to follow.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You should also add any additional information that is specific to your project such as specific bugs to look for,
    which features to test,
    special testing credentials, etc. The more information you provide to your testers and the more specific questions
    you ask them, the more likely you are to receive meaningful feedback.
</p>

<p>
    Add the link to your project details on the course website and verify that it appears on your project page.
</p>

<p>*If your project is a web app the landing page can be the deployed app itself as long as it meets all the criteria of
    the landing page.</p>


== Testing

<p>
    There are no new features added for your beta release so you have 2 weeks to test your code an ensure proper
    functionality (Alpha testing). Although your testing will not affect your grade directly, you will be held
    accountable for any major bugs or errors that appear in your released software. For your beta release there may be
    many
    minor bug reports (this is the purpose of beta testing), but you should not release your beta version with any major
    bugs or broken features. The bugs reported should be such that they would have been very difficult to find in
    development.
</p>
<p>
    It is highly recommended that your team agrees on a robust testing
    methodology so you can release your software with confidence. In addition, robust testing will also make code
    reviews much simpler for the team.
</p>


== YouTube Video
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your Beta release to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements.
</div>
<p>
    Complete a video demo of your beta release and upload it to YouTube. This video must
    show a working demo of all features in your MVP as described in your team contract, but updated with any changes
    made since the previous release.
    As with the previous 2 videos, this video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience and you should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video. However, this video can be used as reference for your beta testers if you post it on your
    landing page so it can be helpful to explain anything that will be relevant specifically to them.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes. The goal is
    to show the end users how the software is supposed to be used.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your beta release video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that the video is displayed properly. Again, it is recommended that you also post this video on your landing page.
</p>

<form action="/courses/cse442-f17/submit-video/beta" method="post">
    <div>
        <label>Video Link:</label>
        <input type="text" name="link"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
    </div>
</form>


== On-Boarding Preparation

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Develop on-boarding documentation in your GitHub wiki.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that there is some documentation. The quality of this documentation will be
    assessed throughout the collaboration phase of the project.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Setup tasks for outside developers.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: These tasks will be displayed on your project page and will be marked for outside help. Course staff
    will verify that each team member has created and tagged at least 1 issue for outside help. Use the "help wanted"
    tag.
</div>

<p>
    During the next phase of the project you will be completing a task for another team in the course, and your class
    mates will be completing tasks for your team. To facilitate this you must prepare your project for the on-boarding
    process and make it possible, or simple, for a developer to visit your project and contribute code. At the end
    of the next phase you will be assessed based on how difficult or easy it was for someone to contribute to your
    project. As with many aspects of this course, submitting quality work in this section will save you time, and
    possibly your grade, later in the course.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
    Use your GitHub wiki to outline your project and provide everything needed for a new developer to join the team. An
    outside developer who is unfamiliar with the project should be able to contribute code to your project after reading
    the wiki without
    having to contact the team (Though they can, and should, contact the team via your Ryver forum, having a
    face-to-face meeting with them might be too
    difficult to schedule so the wiki should leave them with only quick questions). The wiki should also include
    contribution instructions such as how to create a pull request, which branches to use, which tags to use in issues, who to
    assign as a code reviewer, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Your code itself should also be easy to follow and well-organized. Simplicity is critical here. Meaningful naming,
    comments where needed, intuitive directory structure, etc. Try to imagine looking at your repository for the first
    time. Does it make sense? Is it confusing? Are there things that would need explaining? If so, adjust as needed.
</p>


<br/>
<h4>Tasks</h4>

<p>
    Prepare your outside tasks to be completed by students outside your group during the next phase of the project. These
    tasks do not have to be substantial, but they must have some impact on your final product (ie. adding comments is not
    acceptable). These tasks must be tagged with "help wanted" in GitHub issues.
</p>

<p>
    Each team member must create at least 1 task for outside help that falls under their area of the project as defined
    by the team contract.
</p>

<hr/>
<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Assigning outside tasks for an add-on feature can reduce your workload for the next
    submission
<!--</div>-->
<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
<br/>
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Write tests for the tasks that will be completed by outside help to make it absolutely
    clear what needs to be accomplished.
<!--</div>-->



== Grading

<p>
    Note: If an individual team member was solely at fault for the team missing a requirement the team may be exonerated
    of the missing requirement and only the individual will earn a grade decrease. Such incidents will be handled on a
    case-by-case basis and it must be proven that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The student at fault did not complete their required work for this submission</li>
    <li>It is clear that the student knew, or at least should have known, what was required of them for this submission</li>
</ol>
