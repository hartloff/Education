<h4>Staff Visits</h4>

<p>
    On occasion the course staff may visit your team meeting if there is something we'd like to discuss with you. You
    must be able to accommodate this in your meeting schedule. A staff member may visit if there are any issues with the
    project, or if we can offer any specialized help to improve your project. Your team may also request a visit if you
    want help with anything pertaining to your project.
