<h4>Jury Duty</h4>

<p>
    After each project submission you will be assigned several project to rate based on the criteria for the practical
    objectives. These criteria will exactly match the criteria given in the description for each submission. You must
    review each project and fill out the corresponding form within 5 days (120 hours) of receiving your project
    assignments.The ratings submitted via this protocol will be referenced by the course staff while deciding which
    projects have
    met the practical objectives.
</p>

<p>
    You will also be asked to rate the scope of each project, to the best of your knowledge. The scope of each project
    will be considered along with the practical objective ratings while making final practical objective decisions.
</p>

<p>
    Note: You are required to rate your assigned projects, though you may rate any additional projects as well.
