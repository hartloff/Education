== Hot Fixes

<p>
    Note that this protocol only applies to bugs that are reported in your public releases. Bugs found by the team
    in development should be fixed with a feature branch following the code contribution protocol.
</p>

== Protocol

<ul>
    <li>Respond to the bug report within 24 hours</li>
    <li>Assign the task to the team member(s) in the affected area(s)</li>
    <li>Create a hot fix branch off of master for the bug</li>
    <li>Eliminate the bug on the hot fix branch and verify proper functionality</li>
    <li>Pull request, review, and merge into master and develop</li>
    <li>Create new release and pull into production in a timely manner</li>
</ul>


<hr/>
<h4>Respond to the bug report</h4>

<p>
    Once a bug is reported as an issue on your team's GitHub repository your team must make first contact within 24
    hours, excluding Saturday and Sunday (Ex. If a bug is reported Friday night or over the weekend you have until
    Monday night to respond). This first contact can be as little as a comment on the issue. If the task is assigned to
    team member this counts as first contact.
</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Assign the bug to a Team Member</h4>

<p>
    The team must first determine which member, or members, of the team should be responsible for fixing the bug. If the
    team cannot come to an agreement you should move to your team's dispute resolution protocol. Once the appropriate
    member(s) are decided assign the issue to them.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Hot Fix Branch</h4>

<p>
    Similar to creating a feature branch, create a hot fix branch from the master branch. This branch will contain the
    current state of your project that is running in production.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Eliminate the Bug</h4>

<p>
    Work on the hot fix branch until the bug is fixed. Be sure to test the new code in your development environment and
    verify that the bug has been eliminated while maintaining the functionality of the project.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Pull Request and Merge</h4>

<p>
    Create a pull request to merge the code into master. After the pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged you
    will also merge the fix into your develop branch.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Update Release and Production</h4>

<p>
    Create a new release of your master branch in GitHub with an incremented third digit of the version number. For
    example if the previous release was v0.1.0 this release will be v0.1.1. Once your master branch contains the
    updated code, update your production release so your users and testers can benefit from the update.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Timely Bug Fix</h4>

<p>
    This entire protocol must be completed within 1 week (168 hours) of the time the issue for the bug was initially
    created. Note that other constraints may require the bug to be fixed sooner (Ex. If the bug is preventing
    others from testing your software).
