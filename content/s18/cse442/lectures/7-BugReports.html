== Hot Fixes

<p>
    Once your software is released to the public or to your testers you will start to see bug reports in you GitHub
    issues from these users. It is your responsibility to respond to these reports and resolve the issue.
</p>

<p>
    Note that this protocol only applies to bugs that are reported in your public releases by your users. Bugs found by
    the team in development should be fixed with a feature branch following the code contribution protocol.
</p>

== Protocol

<ul>
    <li>Label the issue and respond to the bug report within 24 hours</li>
    <li>Assign the task to the team member(s) in the affected area(s)</li>
    <li>Create a hot fix branch off of master for the bug</li>
    <li>Eliminate the bug on the hot fix branch and verify proper functionality</li>
    <li>Pull request, review, and merge into master and develop</li>
    <li>Create new release and pull into production in a timely manner</li>
</ul>


<hr/>
<h4>Label and respond to the bug report</h4>

<p>
    Once a bug is reported as an issue on your team's GitHub repository your team must label/tag the issue as a bug
    using GitHub labels. Note that the user creating the issue cannot add this label themselves. It is up to the team to
    determine which created issues are bug reports and which are not. If it is a bug report, this protocol must be
    followed in full. If the issue is not a bug report, add an appropriate label to the issue based on its type.
</p>

<p>
    Whenever and issue is created on your team's GitHub repository that is a bug report your team must make first
    contact within 24 hours, excluding Saturday and Sunday (Ex. If a bug is reported Friday night or over the weekend
    you have until Monday night to respond) and spring break, of the creation time of the issue. This first contact can be as simple
    as a comment on the issue or assigning the task to a team member.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Assign the bug to a Team Member</h4>

<p>
    The team must first determine which member, or members, of the team will be responsible for fixing the bug. Refer
    to your team roles to determine who will fix the bug. If the
    team cannot come to an agreement as to who should fix the bug you should move to your team's dispute resolution
    protocol, and update your team roles after the next submission. Once the appropriate
    member(s) are decided assign the issue to them.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Hot Fix Branch</h4>

<p>
    Similar to creating a feature branch, create a hot fix branch off of your master branch. This branch will contain
    the current state of your project that is running in production.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Eliminate the Bug</h4>

<p>
    Work on the hot fix branch until the bug is fixed. Be sure to test the new code in your development environment and
    verify that the bug has been eliminated while maintaining the rest of the functionality of the project
    (ie. don't create more bugs while fixing one).
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Pull Request and Merge</h4>

<p>
    Create a pull request to merge the code into master. After the pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged you
    will also merge the fix into your develop branch.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Update Release and Production</h4>

<p>
    Create a new release of your master branch in GitHub with an incremented minor revision of the version number. For
    example if the previous release was v0.2.0 this release will be v0.2.1. Once your master branch contains the
    updated code, update your production release so your users and testers can benefit from the update.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Timely Bug Fix</h4>

<p>
    This entire protocol must be completed within 1 week (168 hours), not counting spring break, of the time the issue for the bug was initially
    created. Note that other constraints may require the bug to be fixed sooner (Ex. If the bug is preventing
    others from testing your software).
