== Grade Makeups


<p>
    As voted by the class you now have the opportunity to makeup grades after they are released. From the proposal
    this means:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Students have the ability to make up previous phases for full credit on that phase, in so far as the grade
        makeup request is submitted in time and it wasn't a hard deadline
    </li>
    <li>Grade makeups will be requested via a google doc like Grade disputes are</li>
    <li>Grade makeups requests for phase 1 and 2 are due April 4th.</li>
    <li>Grade makeups requests for all other phases are due within a week of receiving the grade for that phase</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This proposal has passed, but it leaves out any meaningful detail or definitions. In such cases the ambiguities are
    left for the course staff to decide at their discretion. Specifically, what it means to "makeup" a grade is not
    defined at all. The new grade makeup protocol in as follows.
</p>

<p>
    First, there are 2 hard deadlines this semester which are the beta release (You have to have a beta release for the
    100-level lab which occurs right after this deadline) and the presentation (Already due at the end of our scheduled
    final exam time).
</p>

<p>
    This protocol can only be used for the 5 remaining project submissions
    (Project setup, prototype, alpha release, collaboration, official release). Lecture activities and protocol
    violations cannot be made up.
</p>

== Protocol

<ul>
    <li>Fill out grade makeup form</li>
    <li>Complete all missed requirements and objectives</li>
    <li>Submit a makeup report electronically and in hard copy</li>
    <li>Regrade Jury Duty</li>
    <li>Auxiliary Requirements</li>
    <li>Decision</li>

    <li>If you are part of someone else's grade dispute you must get involved or it'll be a protocol violation</li>
</ul>


<hr/>
<h4>Grade Makeup Form</h4>

Form: <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2yZvN6lpyH3FxSgvoBd5Sz9F3L5uicr_vd6ClGPlIsjGyTw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Intent
    Form</a>
<p>
    Fill out this form with you team name before the deadline of the grade makeup. There will be no response from the
    course staff after filling out this form. You are only signaling your intent to submit a grade makeup. If anyone
    on a team fills out the form with their team name it will initiate this protocol for the entire team. If your
    team has filled out this form you must complete this protocol before the deadline.
</p>

<p>
    Deadlines are April 4th @ 11:59pm for the team formation and protocol phases and 1 week after receiving your grade for all
    other phases. The entire protocol must be complete before the deadline.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Complete Requirements and Objectives</h4>

<p>
    Undeniably complete every requirement and objective for the phase being made up. Since the team has extra time,
    especially for the first 2 phases, this grading will be very strict! If any of the course staff feels that something
    is missing then the makeup will not be accepted. Notice that this says requirements and objectives. Even if you are
    making up a phase where the team received a -1 for missing a requirement you <b>must</b> successfully complete the
    practical objective as well as the missed requirements in order to get any points back. This is all or nothing.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Makeup Report</h4>

<p>
    Write and submit a makeup report explaining what the team missed and why it is important to fix this mistake. [Note
    that this section is the only reason the proposal was not vetoed. You must justify that grade makeups do not
    interfere with your learning process by showing what you've learned]
</p>

<p>
    Your report must describe the following each in a separate section that is clearly labeled:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>What requirements and/or objectives the team missed and why your submission fell short of these goals. Use specific
    quotes from the course website where these requirements and objectives are described</li>
    <li>The reason why the team was unable to complete these requirements/objectives as stated in the description for
        the phase</li>
    <li>At least 1 specific example about why the tasks missed by the team are important in the real-world. Explain what
    consequences would be faced if this mistake was made in industry</li>
    <li>The educational value the team gained by going through this makeup protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In describing these sections you must use at least 1000 total words in your submission (The number of words I
    had to write to make this protocol, after rounding). This report must be submitted
    both electronically and as a hard-copy signed by all team members and handed to any of the course staff. It is ok to
    submit the hard-copy under Jesse's office door before the deadline.

    Submission Form</a>




<hr/>
<h4>Regrade Jury Duty</h4>

<p>
    At the discretion of the course staff there may be another round or jury duty for this project. Since the project
    has changed since the original deadline we cannot use the original jury duty feedback os another round may be
    necessary. Any members of this jury who do not submit feedback on the makeup will earn a protocol violation.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Implied Requirements</h4>

<p>
    The team filling a makeup request must, of course, follow this protocol. However, there are cases where other
    students in the class will have additional requirements due to a makeup request. For example, if a student is
    making up the collaboration phase this implies that every student who worked with that student during this phase
    will also be required to participate in this protocol or receive a protocol violation. Specific details of the
    requirements will be determined by the course staff on a case-by-case basis.
</p>




<hr/>
<h4>Decision</h4>

<p>
   Once a final decision regarding the makeup submission has been made by the course staff the team (or individual if
    making up the collaboration phase) will be notified. If every aspect of this protocol has been followed exactly
    then the grade for the phase will be changed to +1. If any aspect of this protocol is missing, regardless of how
    small, then the original grade earned will remain in tact in addition to earning a protocol violation for not
    following this protocol.
