== Project Changes

<p>
    You may change any aspect of your project or team within 72 hours after a project deadline. Any changes that do not
    violate an aspect of the course are allowed (Ex. You can change team members, but all teams must still have 3-5
    members)
</p>

== Protocol

<ul>
    <li>Changes must be made within 72 hours after a major project submission</li>
    <li>Changing team members (All involved must unanimously agree)</li>
</ul>


<hr/>
<h4>Changing the project</h4>

<p>
    Any aspect of your project may be changed within 72 hours after a major project deadline. A major deadline is
    defined as any submission that has a practical objective component. Any and all changes must be reflected in the
    appropriate place based on the original submission. For example, changes to the project must appear in the readme
    of your repo, changes to team roles in the wiki, changes to your dispute resolution protocol must be submitted in
    class as a signed hard copy, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Any changes made outside of this 72 hour window will not be valid.
</p>

<p>
    Note that you are allowed to change any aspect of your project including a complete change of the team's project.
    However, no additional consideration or time will be given to a team making such a change and the next deadline must
    be met with the new project idea.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Changing team members</h4>

<p>
    If team members are changing, all members of all affected teams must unanimously agree to the change. As long as
    everyone agrees to the changes and after the change all teams have 3-5 members any such changes will be allowed.
</p>

<p>
    Note that some of your team members may resign from the course during the semester. If this causes you team to have
    fewer than 3 members you <strong>must</strong> apply this protocol and resolve this issue. It is allowed for an
    entire team to be removed from the course if each member finds a team who will add them to their team.
