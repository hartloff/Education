<h3>Part A (40 points) - Simple Array Processing</h3>

<p>
    In JavaScript, define a function named 'everyThirdSum' which will be called with a list of numbers and which
    returns the sum of every third number, starting with the number at index 0. If the list is empty the function
    must return 0.

        everyThirdSum([12, -3, -7, 5, 4]) must return 17
    </li>
    <li>
        everyThirdSum([12, 3, 7]) must return 12
