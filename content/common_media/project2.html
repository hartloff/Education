                <br/>

                <p>
                    The first part of the project was designed as a tutorial that walked you through the process of
                    obtaining data from the Internet, processing the data, then visualizing that data on a web site
                    that you can share with billions people. For part 2 you will be taking this same project structure
                    and build an app of your own design. You will choose a web API to obtain data, choose how you want
                    to filter the data, choose how you want to display the filtered data, then build your web app to
                    accomplish your design. You will not be guided through this part of the project, though you should
                    study the tutorial for part 1 so you are familiar with the structure we used to build a similar app.
                </p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>

                <p>
                    You have a significant amount of flexibility to design this project however you'd like as long as
                    you meet the following criteria.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <h5>The Data</h5>
                <p><b>Choose a data source that you access through a web API</b></p>

                <p>
                    You will choose a data source that will form the base of your app from a web API that we have not
                    already used in this course (ie. 0 credit if you use the parking ticket API. Be creative). This
                    data must be live and obtained with python code via an HTTP request made to the API each time a
                    user visits your site.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some lists of APIs for you to explore. You may use any API hosted on the Internet, though
                    these lists should give you a good place to start</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://data.buffalony.gov/">Buffalo Open Data</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The city of Buffalo has recently released much of their data and host free APIs for
                                developers to build apps. We used the parking ticket API from this project and their are
                                many
                                more APIs with a wealth of city data that is freely available
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC Open Data</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New York City also has an open data project with many freely available APIs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.data.gov/">US Open Data</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open data at the federal level for the United States. If you want to analyze national
                                trends
                                you will find many interesting data sets here
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Other Government Data
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not interested in Buffalo, NYC, or US data? Check if your home city/country has an
                                open data program. These programs have increased in popularity over the past few years
                                and contain data that could improve policies, inform citizens, and even save lives
                                if analyzed properly
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis">Big List of Web APIs</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With over 500 APIs you will find something that interests you in this list. Note
                                that some of these APIs are not hosting data but instead allow you to interact
                                with their app (ex. Google Calendar API). For this project you must analyze data
                                which will exclude some of the APIs on this list
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Any other web API</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you find an API that is not included anywhere in these lists, feel free to use it
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <br/>
                <h5>Process The Data</h5>
                <p><b>On your server (in python), process the data to prepare it for visualization</b></p>

                <p>
                    For example, in part 1 we removed any parking tickets that did not contain a location and removed
                    any fields that were not required for visualization. Recall that the API returns a lot of
                    information
                    about each ticket, but we only send latitude, longitude, and description to the front-end of the
                    app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This processing does not have to be complex to meet this criteria, but you cannot send the
                    results from the API unmodified to your front-end. This may be a simple filter, but your Python
                    code has to process the data from the API before sending it to the front-end for visualization.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <h5>Visualize The Data</h5>
                <p><b>On the front-end of your web app, visualize the data with at least 2 different visualizations</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In part 1 we created one visual which was a map with the parking tickets placed at their locations
                    with their descriptions. In Infinite Questions you built web pages that displayed line/scatter
                    and pie charts. For this part of the project you will choose 2 different (you can't make 2 of
                    the same type of visual. Two maps == 0 credit) visuals to display the processed data that you
                    obtain from your Python server. Note that to make this interesting you may want to have Python
                    process the data in 2 different ways.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Each visual must be generated by a JavaScript library.</b> For example, adding an image to your
                    page using an &lt;img&gt; element or displaying raw text from the API will not count.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recall that <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">Plotly</a> offers a large number of visuals
                    to choose from.
                </p>

                <h3>Additional Criteria</h3>

                <p>
                    In addition to the requirements above you must have one additional aspect to your project. You may
                    choose on aspect from the following list to add. Note that you only need one of these, not all of
                    them, though we won't stop you from implementing more than one.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Add communication between users with persistent storage (File or database) on your server (Ex. A
                        comments section)
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a web framework other than bottle
                        (Ex. <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a>).
                        If you choose this you are expected to learn one of these frameworks by studying the
                        documentation as with other aspects of the course
                    </li>
                    <li>Make a game out of the data using a game framework like <a href="https://phaser.io">phaser</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use 2 different data sets instead of just one and combine them on your front-end. At least
                        one of your visuals must contain information from both data sets (do not just create one plot
                        for each data set). The data
                        sets must come from 2 different APIs (ie. plotting tweets containing #x and tweets containing
                        #y on the same graph will not count).
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a secure login system to your app and have at least 1 feature that utilizes this login</li>
                    <li>Scrape data from an HTML web site instead of using an API. You must still connect to the live
                        site from your server using Python code, but the site will host HTML and you will scrape the
                        live data using Python to extract the data you want to process
                    </li>
                    <li>Other. If you have an idea that is not on this list you can message the instructors on
                        Piazza and we will consider it for approval. If approved it will be added to this list.
                        To be approved the proposed criteria must not be simpler/easier than everything already listed.
                        You may be asked to provide an argument that the suggestion is at least as difficult as one
                        of the listed criteria. To ensure that everyone in the class has an opportunity to review the
                        full list of options any
                        such request must be sent by November 19 (The Monday before break). Requests made after this
                        date will not be considered.
                    </li>

                <h3>Report</h3>

                <p>
                    The first submission for this project will be a brief (no more than 1 page) report about your
                    project. This report will contain the design of your project. In this report you must describe
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A description of what your app accomplishes</li>
                    <li>The data set that you chose</li>
                    <li>How you processed the data on your server</li>
                    <li>How you visualized the data (explain both visuals)</li>
                    <li>The additional criteria you implemented</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Note: There are no formatting or minimum length requirements for this report, but you do have to
                    effectively
                    communicate these 5 criteria. Short sentence fragments and a disorganized format may result in a
                    loss of points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This report is due 1
                    week before your project, but you are highly encouraged to have much of your project complete
                    before
                    the report is due. <b>Once the report deadline passes you cannot change your project</b> and you
                    may
                    realize
                    later that your report is next to impossible to complete. Avoid this by starting your project
                    early
                    while there's still time to change your report.

                <p>
                    In lab during the last week of classes you will give a 5 minute demonstration of your app to
                    one of the TAs.
                    During this demo you will run your app and show the TA all of the functionality that appears
                    in your report and they will verify that you completed the project. This will be the
                    primary way your project will be graded.

                    you will make a short YouTube video (no longer than 1 minute) showing a demo of your app. Through
                    this video your app will be reviewed and rated for it's originality, novelty, and usefulness. To
                    be blunt, we will measure how much you appeared care about your project. If your project barely
                    meets the minimum criteria or if you completed your project only for the grade, you are unlikely
                    to earn full credit for novelty. However if you took your project seriously and built an app that
                    people can gain a benefit from using we want to give you all these points!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note: To earn any novelty points from the video submission you must meet all the requirements and
                    the additional criteria.

                <p>Note the following regarding novelty grading</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The novelty grading is subjective and the descriptions for each point value are the guidelines
                        that will be used during grading. The descriptions are not concrete guidelines as they are for
                        the
                        other parts of the grading rubric
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The novelty of each project will be rated by your peers as well as the course staff. Ratings
                        from
                        your peers may be consulted during grading, though they will not be used to determine your grade
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The uniqueness of your app is considered for these points. This means if your app technically
                        satisfies the wording for a certain number of points you still may not earn those points if
                        many of your classmates submit very similar apps (ie. You're always allowed to share ideas
                        in this class, but implementing someone else's idea is not novel)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We want to the best project to have an opportunity to thrive! You are building a web app that
                    goes live for the whole world to see, but only while it's running in Codenvy. To make your app
                    generally available on the Internet you'll need a hosting service that does not shut down, ever.
                    For the most novel projects we will offer such a service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The video submissions will be rated by you classmates for their novelty. The course staff will
                    host the most highly rated app from each section for at least 1 year (longer if the site had traffic
                    and the student is interested)
                    on a web hosting service. The staff will also choose 2 additional projects from any section(s) at
                    our discretion. These 6 projects/students will receive
                </p>

                    <li>
                        A domain name for at least 1 year paid for by the course staff. Winners may choose any available
