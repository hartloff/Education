                <hr/>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s build a web app! In the process of building this app we will see how all the different
                    concepts we have been
                    learning can work together to make something greater. This will feel like a tutorial. For part 2
                    of
                    the project you
                    will build a similar web app, except you will choose what to build and work on it on your own
                    without a tutorial.
                    For this app we will connect to an API containing location-based data using python, then serve
                    this
                    data to our web
                    site where we’ll write javascript code to display the data on a map on an HTML web page.. So
                    there’s
                    a bit to unpack
                    here and we’ll go through this step-by-step, but first, let’s look at the data we will be
                    displaying.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The Data</b>: Here’s a link to some parking ticket data
                    (<a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.buffalony.gov/ux3f-ypyc">
                    https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.buffalony.gov/ux3f-ypyc</a>) which
                    is part of the city of Buffalo’s <a href="https://data.buffalony.gov/">Open Data Portal</a>. On
                    the
                    parking ticket
                    page you will find information about the data
                    we’ll be using for this project. Among this data you will find the API endpoint to access the
                    data
                    as a JSON string.
                    We
                    will use all the default options for this endpoint which will give us 1000 recent tickets issues
                    in
                    the city of
                    Buffalo.
                    There are millions of records in this dataset so feel to explore more than this. You may also
                    need
                    to obtain an API
                    key
                    for this dataset. The data is open to the public, but if you make too many requests they may
                    block
                    your IP address
                    from
                    making more queries. With an API key you will have a higher limit on the number of requests that
                    can
                    be made.
                </p>

                <h3>Front End</h3>

                <div id="section2-1">
                    <h5>HTML</h5>
                    <p>
                        We’ll start with the front-end display of our web app. Since this is not a course
                        in HTML/CSS we will provide the HTML for you here.
                    </p>

        body, div{
            height: 100%;
        }

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body onload="loadMap();"&gt;

&lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
                    <p> Start a new project in Codenvy and save this text in a file named “index.html”. You can open
                        this
                        page in your browser by right clicking the file and choosing preview, however at this point
                        nothing
                        will be displayed yet. If you are familiar with HTML you can edit this file and see your
                        creations
                        in the preview tab. As always to goto site to learn about HTML, and many other web technologies,
                        is
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. Your HTML file will not be graded so feel
                        free
                        to add anything you’d like to this page. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="section2-2">
                    <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                    <p> Now that we have a web page setup, let’s use JavaScript to display a map on it. To do this we
                        will
                        use the <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly</a> library in conjunction with <a
                                href="https://www.mapbox.com/maps/">mapbox</a>. To use mapbox you will need to register
                        for
                        an account and obtain an access token (API key) to be able to use this service. The service is
                        free
                        for the first 50,000 map views per month and you do not have to enter a credit card to use the
                        free
                        views. Once you have your access token, enter into the JavaScript code replacing the placeholder
                        value. </p>
                    <p> Create a file named “maps.js” in the same directory as index.html and in it write a
                        function named loadMap() that will set up a
                        map based to be displayed on your page. Note that loadMap is called
                        from the HTML file once the page is loaded. Also notice that the empty div in the HTML that will
                        contain the map had an id of
                        "map". Now, follow the <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/scattermapbox/">basic example</a>
                        from
                        the plotly documentation to get familiar
                        with what we’re about to do and to see a map in your HTML.
                    </p>

                    <!--<p> Now in the code there is a call to getMapParams that takes a JSON string and returns an object-->
                    <!--containing keys ‘data’ and ‘layout’, however this function does not exists. Let’s start writing-->
                    <!--functions to correct this. </p>-->
                    <p> Now that the map is being displayed and the project is setup it’s time for you to write some
                        code
                        that will enable you to read a JSON string of locations with descriptions and place a marker on
                        the
                        map for each of them. Write the following functions in maps.js: </p>


                    <p><b>setupMapData</b>: Write a function named “setupMapData” that takes an array as a parameter and
                        returns
                        an array containing the data for a map. Each element in the input array will itself be an array
                        in
                        the format [latitude, longitude, description] where latitude and longitude are floating point
                        numbers and description is a string describing the event at this location. An example input
                        would be
                        [[20.3,-56.8, "test point 1"],[26.3,-59.8, "test point 2"],[21.3,-50.8, "test point 3"]]. </p>
                    <p> This function will return an array containing only 1 element which is an object containing the
                        data
                        for a map that will be used in the same way as the “data” variable from the <a
                                href="https://plot.ly/javascript/scattermapbox/">plotly documentation</a>. For our
                        application, set the following key-value pairs in the object that is in the array: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A key of “type” mapping to the string “scattermapbox”
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the type of plot we are creating.
                                Plotly can generate a wide variety of visuals so we need to specify that we are creating
                                a map
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            A key
                            of “mode” mapping to the string “markers”
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This tells plotly that we are placing markers on the
                                map
                                and that it should look for data about these markers in this data object
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>A key of “marker”
                            mapping
                            to an object with 2 key-value pairs which are a key of “size” mapping to the integer 5 and a
                            key
                            “color” mapping to the string “rgb(255,0,0)”
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This sets the style of the markers. We are making
                                red
                                markers of size 5
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            A key of “lat” containing an array of all the latitudes from the input array
                            in
                            the same order as they appear in the input
                        </li>

                        <li>A key of “lon” containing an array of all the
                            longitudes
                            from the input array in the same order as they appear in the input
                        </li>

                        <li>A key of “text” containing an
                            array of all the descriptions from the input array in the same order as they appear in the
                            input
                        </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>These last 3 key-value pairs specify the location and text for each marker to be placed
                                on the
                                map.
                                The order is important as a single point contains data from all 3 of these at the same
                                index in
                                each
                                array. Anything that alters the order of any of these arrays will corrupt all of our
                                markers
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <p> Note that we will use this for parking violations but this function can be reused for any
                        location
                        based data that you want to display on a map (ie. you can reuse this function in part 2 of the
                        project) </p>
                    <p><b>findCenter</b>: Write a function named “findCenter” that takes an array as a parameter in the
                        same
                        format as the previous function and returns an array with two elements representing the latitude
                        and
                        longitude of the center of these locations. This will be used to center our map around our data.
                        To
                        compute the center latitude take the average of the minimum and maximum latitudes from the
                        input.
                        Repeat for longitude. </p>
                    <p><b>setupMapLayout</b>: Write a function named “setupMapLayout” that takes an array as a parameter
                        in
                        the
                        same format as the previous function and returns an object </p>
                    <p> This function will return an object containing the layout settings for the map that will be used
                        in
                        the same way as the “layout” variable from the <a

                    <ul>
                        <li>A key of “mapbox” mapping to an object with the mapbox settings. This will be the only
                            key-value pair in

                                    adjust the zoom level while testing as the zoom of 11 is set specifically for the

                    <p><b>getMapParams</b>: Write a function named “getMapParams” that takes a JSON formatted string
                        as a
                        parameter and returns all the information needed to create a map in an object with “data” and
                        “layout”
                        as keys mapping to a data array and a layout object respectively. This input JSON string will be
                        in
                        the
                        format of an array of arrays where each inner array is contains [latitude, longitude,

                        Note
                        that this is the same format as the other functions except the input is a JSON string that needs
                        to
                        be
                        parsed instead of a JavaScript array. This function will be responsible for converting from
                        string
                        to
                        array, then call your other functions after converting. </p>
                    <p> Note: do not overthink this function. You’ll parse the JSON, call 2 of your function and add the

                    <h5>Background</h5>

                    <p> Setting up the server Background: Ok, we have a map setup and we can add markers
                        to it. The way we’ve setup these functions all we need to do is give our JavaScript code a JSON
                        formatted string representing an array of arrays where each inner array is in the format
                        [latitude,
                        longitude, description] with latitude and longitude as floating point numbers and description as
                        a
                        string. Our map doesn’t care where this data comes from or how it gets it, as long as it gets
                        data to
                        display. So what data should we send it? How about parking tickets in Buffalo, NY! </p>
                    <p> The data, mentioned at the top of this document, is hosted at this url </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://data.buffalony.gov/resource/ux3f-ypyc.json">https://data.buffalony.gov/resource/ux3f-ypyc.json</a>
                    </p>
                    <p> You can click the link and view the JSON in your browser, though you’ll notice a few things that
                        need to be done before we can plot these on the map. First, there is a lot more information here
                        than our map is expecting so you’ll have to filter it down to only lat/long/description. Second,
                        if
                        you look closely at the data you’ll see that some of the violations do not have a location which
                        will need to be addressed. And finally we have to get this data into our javascript functions.
                        The
                        first two problems can be handled with some clever code, but the last problem will take some
                        work. </p>
                    <p> There are a few approaches that you might consider to move the data. Let’s go through some
                        options
                        that won’t work well and see what issues they have. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Save the data in a json file and read
                            it
                            with JavaScript code
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For security reasons JavaScript that’s executed in the browser cannot read
                                files.
                                This prevents websites you visit from reading files from your computer
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>We could cut and paste the
                            data
                            into our JavaScript file, or a separate JavaScript file that we include using script tags in
                            our
                            HTML
                            file
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This will work, but there are some problems. The first is a stylistic problem in that
                                it’s
                                generally considered poor form to have large amounts of hard-coded data in your code.
                                However there
                                is
                                much more important reason not to do this, especially in this case. The data is being
                                updated
                                regularly.
                                If we paste the data into our code, someone will have to paste it again every time the
                                API updates.
                                If
                                you are deploying an app that will be used for years do you want to manually update it
                                every day? Do
                                you
                                want to pay an employee to do such a tedious task?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>How about writing JavaScript code that will
                            access
                            the API directly and get the most up-to-date data
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This would solve all of our problems. It’s
                                automated,
                                the data is always current, and we wouldn’t hard-code any data. It’s almost a perfect
                                answer.
                                However,
                                just like reading files, JavaScript (in the browser) can’t do this either due to the <a
                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same origin policy</a>.
                                This is another
                                security measure that prevents the sites you visit from making requests to other sites
                                on your
                                behalf.
                                For an example, assume you are currently logged in on &lt;popular_social_media_site_248&gt;
                                and you
                                click on a shady link. If it were not for the same origin policy this shady site could
                                make requests
                                on
                                your social media on your behalf and have all your data sent to their servers, make
                                posts on your
                                behalf, change your password, etc. So this policy means more work for us while
                                developing web apps,
                                but
                                it’s worth it to avoid such attacks.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p> OK, so now that we’ve seen that the simpler approaches
                        won’t work and why they won’t work let’s see a solution that will. </p>

                    <h5>Server Setup</h5>

                    <p> In this part you will write a python web server that will connect to the API,
                        filter the data, and send the data to our javascript code upon request. Since this code is
                        running
                        on your server instead of the browser we have access to the full power of programming in python
                        (It
                        is assumed that you trust code running on your server, but not code running in your
                        browser). </p>
                    <p> To start setting up the server you will have to follow these steps: </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Install bottle - “pip
                            install --user bottle”
                        </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>As our web framework of choice we will use <a
                                    href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">bottle</a>. This is a simple and light-weight
                                framework
                                that can accomplish everything we need for this project. To install bottle in Codenvy
                                click on the
                                “Terminal” tab on the pane near the bottom of the window, type “pip install --user
                                bottle” and hit
                                enter. This will install the library
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>In the run command (click the "Commands" tab) that you will use to run python programs for
                            this project scroll to the bottom of the page and enter “http://${server.port.8080}” in the
                            “preview
                            URL” text area. This will display the URL of your server when you run the server
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Now that the
                        logistics
                        are done we are ready to write a web server. Create a new file in the same directory as
                        your
                        HTML and JavaScript files and name it “server.py”. To write your server you can use the <a
                                href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">bottle documentation</a> though there a few things
                        we’ll
                        have to do specifically to make this work in Codenvy. First, in the call to run use “0.0.0.0”
                        instead of
                        “localhost” and second, when <a
                                href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#routing-static-files">hosting
                            static files</a> the root should be “/projects/&lt;your_project_name&gt;”. Note that if you
                        see an
                        import error when you import bottle your install of bottle did not work and you should go back
                        to
                        the
                        steps above. It is also recommended that you add a third argument to the call of run of
                        “debug=True”
                        (without the quotes). This will display error reports in your browser if something goes wrong on
                        the
                        server which will help you fix your bugs.</p>

                    <p>
                        Now, in server.py setup your server to do the
                        following.
                        Note that you may name your functions whatever you’d like in this file. For grading only your
                        server
                        paths will be tested. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Host “index.html” as a static file on the root path “/”</li>
                        <li>Host “maps.js” as a static file on the path “/maps.js”</li>
                        <li>Host the data for the map (JSON string representing an array of arrays with [lat, lon,
                            description]) on the path “/tickets”. We’ll add data to this path in the next step
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Now
                        that your server is setup you can run your code and verify that it works. Go ahead and run
                        server.py. If there are no errors you should see a url in the console. Click that url. If
                        everything
                        is setup properly you should see your map from the first part of the project. You now have a web
                        app
                        that is running, hosted on a server, and available to everyone with an Internet connection. You
                        can
                        send this url to your family back home and they can see your project (As long as they click it
                        while
                        your Codenvy machine is running). </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Whenever you change your python code you must restart the code to see the changes</b>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Connecting JavaScript and Python</b>: You are now hosting the front end of your website
                        through a
                        python
                        server, but the server is only hosting the files statically and there is no meaningful
                        interaction
                        between the front end and the server. Let’s change that and add more power to the web app. </p>
                    <p> Replace your loadMap function with the following code. This code uses some topics that we won’t
                        cover in this class (instantiating classes, callbacks, the ‘this’ keyword) so in the spirit of
                        fairness you are provided this code. This will be the final version of loadMap.</p>
                    <pre>
Plotly.setPlotConfig({
    mapboxAccessToken: '&lt;your_mapbox_API_key&gt;'
});

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200){
        mapParams = getMapParams(response);
        Plotly.plot('map', mapParams.data, mapParams.layout);
    }
};
xhttp.open("GET", "/tickets");
xhttp.send();
                    </pre>
                    <p> Once this is your loadMap function, after your page loads your JavaScript code will make a
                        second
                        request to the server with the path “/tickets” to obtain whatever data that path returns. To
                        test
                        this functionality you can have this path return a JSON string in the proper format and check if
                        the
                        entered points are displayed on the map when loaded through the server. For example: </p>
                    <pre>
@bottle.route('/tickets')
def get_tickets():
    return json.dumps([[20.3,-56.8, "test point 1"],[26.3,-59.8, "test point 2"]])

                <div id="section3-3">
                    <h5>Ticket API</h5>
                    <p> You have a front end that displays a map and adds markers to it, you have a server
                        hosting the files for the front end, and you have made a connection between the front end and
                        the
                        server to send data to be marked on the map. The only thing left to do is to get data from the
                        API
                        and return it from the “/tickets” path on the server.
                    </p>
                    <p> Create another python file named “tickets.py” that will contain all the code that works with the
                        thicket data. This file will only contain one function: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In “tickets.py” write a function
                            named
                            “get_ticket_data” that takes a single string representing the url for an API endpoint that
                            is
                            hosting
                            ticket data (you will call this function with
                            “https://data.buffalony.gov/resource/ux3f-ypyc.json”
                            as
                            the input). This function will return a JSON string containing all the data from the
                            endpoint in the
                            format we have been using throughout the project (An array of arrays where the inner arrays
                            contain
                            [latitude, longitude, description]) where the description is the value at the “viodesc” key
                            (violation
                            description). Be sure that your function accomplishes all the following.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filter out any violations
                                that
                                don’t have a lat/long location
                            </li>
                            <li>Convert the lat/long to floating point numbers (notice that they are
                                strings in the API)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Your last task for this project is to edit your server to have the “/tickets”
                        path return the result of a call to
                        get_ticket_data(“https://data.buffalony.gov/resource/ux3f-ypyc.json”). The call is simple
                        enough,
                        however that function needs to be called from different file from where it’s defined so the
                        function
                        call will cause a function not found error. To fix this you will import your file just like
                        we’ve
                        been importing python libraries. Since these files are in the same directory, and it’s the root
                        directory of the project, this can be done with “import tickets” in your server.py file. Now you
                        can
                        call you function just like any other imported code: “tickets.get_ticket_data(url)”. </p>
                    <p> If everything is setup correctly you should be able to restart your server, click your preview
                        link,
                        and see markers on your map with ticket data. </p>
