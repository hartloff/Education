== Properties

<p>
    Variables have several properties:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="type"></span></li>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="name"></span></li>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="value"></span></li>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="location"></span></li>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="scope"></span></li>
    <li><span class="deeper-dive" data-concept="variables" data-topic="lifetime"></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    To fully understand how variables work in a computer program it is necessary to have a firm grasp on each of these
    properties.
</p>


== Type

<p>
    From the perspective of programmer the type of a variable determines
    the set of values which can be assigned to it. The type also
    determines the internal representation of those values, including the
    encoding used and the number of bits allocated for the representation.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the Java type named int. As we know the values of type int
    are whole numbers: values like 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, etc. It turns
    out that there is a limited range of values that are representable as
    an int: -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. (Why those specific values?
    That's another DeepDive topic: understanding the two's complement
    representation.)
</p>

<p>A value of type int occupies 32 bits of memory and is encoded using
    the two's complement representation. (What are bits? That's another
    DeepDive topic: understanding memory.) Java has three other types
    that use the two's complement encoding: byte, short and long. Why?
    They are different sizes, and so can encode different ranges of
    values. A byte occupies 8 bits, and can represent values from -128 to
    +127. A short occupies 16 bits, and can represent values from -32,768
    to +32,767. A long occupies 64 bits, and can represent values from
    -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,80.
</p>

<p>A value of type float or double uses a different encoding to
    represent numeric values, called the IEEE754 encoding (named for the
    IEEE standard that specifies the encoding). A float represents values
    using 32 bits, whereas a double uses 64 bits.
</p>


== Name

<p>
    The name of a variable is available in the high-level program. It
    does not actually exist at runtime.
</p>

<div class="deeper-dive" data-concept="names" data-topic="uses-of-names"></div>


== Value

<p>
    The value of a variable is what is stored in the variable, encoded as
    per the type.
</p>


== Location

<p>
    Where in memory the variable exists.
</p>


== Scope

<p>
    The textual extent of the variable declaration in the high-level program.
</p>


== Lifetime

<p>
    The period of time during the execution of a program that the variable
    is actually bound to a location in memory.
