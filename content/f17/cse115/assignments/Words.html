== Estimated Time

<h2>1,000,000,000 Hours</h2>

== Background

<p>
TextTwist2 is a game in which you create words from the letters of a
seven-letter word.  For example, if we pick "smooths" as our reference
word we can form words such as "moth", "moths", "moot", "soot", "hot",
"toss", etc.

There are several websites where you can play this game, including:
<blockquote>http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/texttwist2.jsp
</blockquote>
You can probably find others.  Read the instructions for the game, and
try it out, so you have a better understanding of what you're aiming
for.  Our rules may be a little different in the end, so don't get too
hung up on the specific rules (especially if you look at several
different websites).
