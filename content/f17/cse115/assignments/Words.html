== Background


<p>
This is the first part of our Word Play homework.  By the end of the
semester we will have built our own simple version of a popular word
game called TextTwist2.  TextTwist2 is a game in which you create
words from the letters in a given seven-letter word.  For example, if
we pick "smooths" as our reference word we can form words such as
"moth", "moths", "moot", "soot", "hot", "toss", etc.
</p>

<p>
There are several websites where you can play this game, including:
<a href="https://www.mindgames.com/game/TextTwist+2">https://www.mindgames.com/game/TextTwist+2</a>
<a href="http://zone.msn.com/en/texttwist2">http://zone.msn.com/en/texttwist2</a>
<a href="http://www.agame.com/game/texttwist-2">http://www.agame.com/game/texttwist-2</a>
You can probably find others.  Read the instructions for the game, and
try it out, so you have a better understanding of what you're aiming
for.  Our rules may be a little different in the end, so don't get too
hung up on the specific rules (especially if you look at several
different websites).
</p>

<p>
For this first part of the assignment we will have you define some of
the core methods of the game, and nothing more.

== Part 1

<h4>Due:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Monday, October 2 @ 8:00am</strong>
</p>
<hr/>

<h4>Repository Link:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>ssh://ubit@timberlake.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/CSE115/Repositories/Fall2017/HW2_Part1</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Use the link above and follow the same procedure as you have for the coding exercises in lab. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiij77tpDM4
    Remember to replace "ubit" in the above URI with <i>your UBIT name</i>,
</p>

<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>5 hours</strong>
</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Word Play we will write several methods that will form the basis for the game. These
    methods will be defined in a class called Model. Specific problem descriptions are provided as comments in the
    handout code and can be seen after cloning the repository.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    The repository includes a Testing class that can be used to test your code without having to submit through AutoLab.
    This class contains one call to the first method for the assignment and you are strongly encouraged to add your own
    test cases for all the other methods as well. When you submit to AutoLab it will give you a know test case that is
    used while grading for each method that is not correct. You should add these test cases to your Testing class to
    streamline your testing process. This allows you to run the Testing class to check your code instead of creating a
    jar and submitting on AutoLab for every check.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submit a jar file of your project under "Word Play - Part 1" on
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/wordplaypart1">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog.
