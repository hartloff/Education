== Estimated Time

<h2>1,000,000,000 Hours</h2>


== Background

<p>
    Maps are cool and we can do traffic too!
</p>


== Lab?

<p>
    Something with lat/long. Maybe computing greater circle distance between two points. Maybe the distance of a path.
</p>

== Homework?

<p>
    Travel times for an itinerary? Provide a list of airport by lat/long. Assume you travel in a straight-line to any
    airport at a certain speed. Assume a flight travels at a certain speed plus time for boarding etc. Find the best
    path. Should a flight be taken? If so, between which two airports? Incorporate border crossings? Find the closest
    border crossing by greater circle distance. (I have to leave the country NOW! Find the least total time to leave the
    country. Can incorporate Mexico and Canada and have them start in the center of the country to make it interesting..
    or if this is later in the semester have them colorize a US map to visualize the best border to use by state, or
    county)
</p>

<p>
    Challenge questions (at P2/331 level) - Provide
    graph of connected airports so there's not always a direct path. Now find the shortest path. Could also include a
    graph of roads with intersections as nodes and travel times as edges.. or even distance and average speed limit as
    edges and let them fully customize, as in input the percentage of the speed limit you will travel
