<h4>Estimated Time:</h4>
<p>
    <strong>5 hours</strong>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    In this part of Geography you will write several methods that give
    you practice writing loops (either for or foreach loops), if
    statements, working with HashMaps and other types, calling
    methods, and applying some of your algorithm lessons from last
    week.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
    The repository includes a Testing class that can be used to test your code without having to submit through AutoLab.
    This class contains one call to the first method for the assignment and you are strongly encouraged to add your own
    test cases for all the other methods as well. When you submit to AutoLab it will give you a know test case that is
    used while grading for each method that is not correct. You should add these test cases to your Testing class to
    streamline your testing process. This allows you to run the Testing class to check your code instead of creating a
    jar and submitting on AutoLab for every check.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
    Submissions in AutoLab will be available no later than Tuesday, October 3. Submit a jar file of your project under
    "Geography - Part 1" on <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-f17/assessments/geography1">AutoLab</a>.
    Remember to check the correct boxes in the jar file export dialog!
