== Motivation?

Maybe a few exam questions, but no homework to test this material. This is for the last few lectures or the whole last
week and meant more as a cool down and some brain candy for those interested.

== Compilation

What's going on under the hood.

Java bytecode

the JVM

Compare with fully compiled languages.
Compare with interpreted languages.
Java lies between these two.

== Binary

Processors only understand 1's and 0's and can only perform a handful of very basic operations. Everything else is CS.
This is motivated from day 1. This is where we go into some details.

Machine code. Processor instruction sets are the only "functions" a computer can run. Everything else is built from
those instructions. Everything! Computers are pretty much just really fast adders with great memory.

== Scope

The current state of code: For quite a few decades there have been millions of developers creating software,
libraries, languages, etc. The landscape is vast! A significant amount of code is shared openly on sites like GitHub.
Knowing all about software is like saying you've read every novel ever. Aint ganna happen! Pick the parts that interest
you and dive in.

== Closing Remarks

You will need to know the basics moving forward. CSE majors/minors: If you didn't understand something,
study it before taking 116.
