[Monday - No class - Labor day]
[Wednesday - Calling methods (Math, String), Defining methods (void, various numbers of parameters)]
[Friday - Activity: variables, expressions, writing the body of a method]

[With hindsight: This week seemed fine, but students struggled in lab since they never had to write a method header
until then. Next time have PS/Lecture questions that only have a comment that gives an english description of the
method they should write without providing the skeleton]

== Methods


<p>
    Methods provide a way for us to store lines of code to be used later. The code stored in a method can be reused
    as many times as we'd like, making methods a great way to store commonly needed code and using whenever it's
    needed without having to rewrite, or even revisit, the code. Taking this one step further, it also allows us to
    easily share code with others. If someone has shared a method that does what we need, we can use that method
    instead of writing our own code to do the same thing. In this case, we don't even have to think about how to solve
    the problem. We just use the method that is available to us.
</p>

<p>Methods allow us to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reuse code</li>
    <li>Ignore details</li>
    <li>Organize code</li>
    <li>Get more done faster</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>We don't always a method to perform the exact same action every time it's called. For instance, what if we want to
    write a method to compute the cube of any given number. Here we will use parameters (input variables) in the
    method to get the value of the number to cube.</p>
<p>
    A method must be correct on every possible input value.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Return value</h4>
<p>
    Methods can optionally return a value. This value is given back to whomever called the method. In the example
    above, the cube of the input would be returned to the caller.
</p>

== Methods

<p>We are covering the concept of methods, but there are no methods in java! Don't panic, we will still use
    everything we're learning about methods but in java we will apply our knowledge to methods.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Method</b>: A procedure defined within a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In java every line of code we write is part of a class, with very few exceptions. Since all our code is contained
    within a class we are writing methods, not methods.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Calling a method</h4>

<p>
    There are many different ways to call a method. We will analyze this common format first.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
[variable name] = methodName([arguments]);
</code></pre>


<ul>
    <li><b>variable name</b>: The variable where the return value of the method will be stored</li>
    <li><b>methodName</b>: The name of the method to be called</li>
    <li><b>arguments</b>: The inputs to the method. The order of the arguments is important.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<pre><code class="java">
[variable name] = [class].methodName([arguments]);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="java">
[variable name] = [object].methodName([arguments]);
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this lesson we will call methods that are part of a class (Math) or part of an object (String instance). In
    these cases we will use the dot operator (.) to access the methods of the class/object.
</p>


== Math Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#method_summary">Math Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    Java provides a variety of methods to perform common mathematical operations contained in the Math class. We will
    see a few example methods below. See the link above for a full reference of methods in the Math class.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Square Root</h4>
<p>
    Math.sqrt(double input) returns the square root of the input double.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    double input = 9.0;
    double result = Math.sqrt(input);
    System.out.println(result);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>3.0</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Absolute Value</h4>
<p>
    Math.abs(double input) returns the square root of the input double. The abs method will also work with int,
    long, and float types.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    double input = 9.0;
    double negativeInput = -9.0;
    double result = Math.abs(input);
    double negativeResult = Math.abs(negativeInput);
    System.out.println(result);
    System.out.println(negativeResult);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>9.0<br/>9.0</kbd>


<p>
    Absolute value is useful for distance calculations. Here we compute the distance between two numbers with the same
    result regardless of the order of the subtraction. This allows us to compute distance even if we don't know which
    value is larger.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    double a = 15.0;
    double b = 10.0;
    double distance = Math.abs(a-b);
    double reverseDistance = Math.abs(b-a);
    System.out.println(distance);
    System.out.println(reverseDistance);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>5.0<br/>5.0</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Exponentiation</h4>
<p>
    Math.pow(double a, double b) return a raised to the b power. This method takes 2 inputs separated by a comma and
    their order is important.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    double base = 2.0;
    double exponent = 8.0;
    double result = Math.pow(base, exponent);
    System.out.println(result);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>256.0</kbd>
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Random Number Generator (RNG)</h4>

<p>
    Math.random() will return a pseudo-random double between 0.0 and 1.0.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    if(Math.random() > 0.5){
        System.out.println("There is a 50% chance this line will be printed");
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Each time the above is executed there will be a 50% chance that the String value will be printed to the console.
</p>
<p>What if we don't want a value in the range 0.0-1.0? What if we want a value from 0.0-100.0? We'll multiply the
    result!</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    double randomNumber = Math.random()*100;
    System.out.println("The random value is: " + randomNumber);
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be a random double between 0.0 and 100.0</p>


== String Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#method_summary">String Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    The String methods are slightly different that Math methods in that they are called on a specific instance of a
    String value using the . operator (dot operator). This means we must have a String in our control to use these
    methods. Below are a few common String methods. See the link above for a complete list of String methods.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Length</h4>
<p>
    length() returns the number of characters in the String. This includes spaces and other white space characters.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    String input = "a String";
    int inputLength = input.length();
    System.out.println(inputLength);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>8</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Contains</h4>
<p>
    contains(String pattern) returns true if the String contains pattern as a sub string, false otherwise.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    String url = "buffalo.edu";
    System.out.println(url.contains(".com");
    System.out.println(url.contains(".edu");
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>false<br/>true</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Lower Case</h4>
<p>
    toLowerCase() returns a copy of the String in all lower case letters. Note that this method does not change the
    value of the String itself.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    String input = "STOP YELLING";
    String output = input.toLowerCase();
    System.out.println(input);  // The original value is unchanged
    System.out.println(output); // The method call returns the lowercase String
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>STOP YELLING<br/>stop yelling</kbd>


== Defining Methods

<p>
    Method definition:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
[access] [return type] methodName([parameters]){
  [body]
 }
</code></pre>

<dl>
    <dt>access</dt>
    <dd>Determines how the method can be accessed. We will explore different levels of access when we explore classes.
        For now, we've been using "static" which allows us to call the method without creating an instance of the class
        (object).
    </dd>
    <dt>return type</dt>
    <dd>The type of the variable returned by the method. The method must contain a return statement with a value of
        this type. If the return type is "void" the method doesn't return a value and can omit the return statement.
    </dd>
    <dt>methodName</dt>
    <dd>The name used to call the method.</dd>
    <dt>parameters</dt>
    <dd>Comma-separated list of the methods input variables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Calling a method:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">
    methodName([arguments])
</code></pre>
<dl>
    <dt>methodName</dt>
    <dd>The name used to define the method.</dd>
    <dt>arguments</dt>
    <dd>Comma-separated list of the methods input values. The values will assigned to the parameters in the method
        definition. The types and order must match between the arguments and parameters.
    </dd>
    <dt>return value</dt>
    <dd>A method call is an expression that evaluates to a value matching the return type of the method. This is the
        value that is returned with the <code>return</code> keyword inside the body of the method.
    </dd>
</dl>


<hr/>

<p>
    Let's examine a java program and trace through its execution.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    public int myMethod(int input){
        int result = input*10;
        return result;
    }

    public void foo(){
        int returnValue = myMethod(5);
        System.out.println(returnValue);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>50</kbd>
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> Execution
    starts with the main method (not shown in this example).  Let us
    assume that this method calls the foo() method.</li>
    <li><code>int returnValue = myMethod(5);</code> The right side of the equal sign is evaluated to produce a single
        int value
    </li>
    <li><code>myMethod(5)</code> Look for a method named myMethod and call it with an argument of 5 as an int</li>
    <li><code>static int myMethod(int input){</code> Shift control to myMethod to resolve the method call</li>
    <li><code>int input = 5;</code> <b>The hidden line</b>. Create an int variable, name it input, and assign it the
        argument value of 5
    </li>
    <li><code>int result = input*10;</code> Create an int variable, name it result, and assign it the result of input*10
    </li>
    <li><code>int result = 5*10;</code></li>
    <li><code>int result = 50;</code></li>
    <li><code>return result;</code> Return the value of result back to the foo method</li>
    <li><code>return 50;</code> *The return value must match the return type from the method header</li>
    <li><code>int returnValue = 50;</code> Back in the foo method, the call to myMethod(5) is replaced by its return
        value. All variable declared within the method fall out of scope and are destroyed
    </li>
    <li><code>System.out.println(returnValue);</code> Print the value of returnValue</li>
    <li><code>System.out.println(50);</code></li>
    <li><code>System.out.println("50");</code></li>
    <li><code>}</code> The end of the foo method is reached.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>


== Multiple Parameters

<p>
    If a method requires multiple parameters, their types and names are given as a comma-separated list. It is important
    to note the order of these parameters when calling a method with multiple parameters.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    public int subtract(int firstParameter, int secondParameter){
        return firstParameter - secondParameter;
    }

    public void foo(){
        System.out.println(subtract(5,3));
        System.out.println(subtract(3,5));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>2<br/>-2</kbd>

<p>
    In the case of calling <code>subtract(5,3)</code> there are now 2 hidden lines of code that executed before running
    the method's code, <code>int firstParameter = 5;</code> and <code>int secondParameter = 3;</code>.
</p>
<p>
    When calling <code>subtract(3,5)</code> the hidden lines are <code>int firstParameter = 3;</code> and <code>int
    secondParameter = 5;</code>.
</p>

<p>A method may contain any number of parameters, even 0. Many of the early methods in this course didn't have any
    parameters and took the form of <code>Q1()</code>. Even with no parameters, method calls and definitions must
    include the parentheses. In this way Java can distinguish between a method with no parameters, and a variable name.
</p>

== void

<p>
    Defining a method with a return type of void means the method doesn't return anything when it is called. These are
    typically methods that perform an action, as opposed to computing a value. An example of a method with return type
    void is <code>System.out.println</code>. We use his method to print text to the screen for the user to read and we
    don't need any return value.
</p>

<p>
    When defining methods with a void return type, including a return statement is optional. If a return statement is
    used in a void method it must be used with no value <code>return;</code> and methods similar to
    <code>break;</code> in a loop in that it immediately exits the method call and returns control to the calling
    method.
</p>
