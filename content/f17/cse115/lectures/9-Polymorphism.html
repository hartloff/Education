== Object-Oriented Programming

<p>
    We've been using objects throughout this course, but we haven't put much emphasis on the objects and instead used
    them as a means to an end. We have been primarily focused on writing methods to accomplish a
    particular goal in terms of input and output (given some values, return a particular value). In this section we
    will take a step back and analyze how we organize code in a larger
    object-oriented program. We'll see how different objects (and classes) interact with each other and how they are
    related.
</p>

<p>
    If you are not comfortable with Classes and Objects you may want to review the Classes concept before exploring OOP.
</p>

== Inheritance

<p>
    One of the primary concepts of the OOP paradigm is inheritance which provides a way for classes to "borrow" code
    from other classes. When a class inherits another class, it gains all the features of the inherited class.
    Specifically, it "inherits"
    all the member variables and methods from the other class. This allows the inheriting class to add new features to
    another class while reusing all the existing code from the first class. This may seem strange at first (why not just
    use one class and keep adding features) but we'll see why this is a very powerful and useful concept.
</p>

<p>
    Consider a case where you have two classes that have very similar functionality with a small number of important
    differences:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class Car {

    private String make;
    private String model;
    private boolean engineRunning;

    public Car(String make, String model){
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.engineRunning = false;
    }

    public void start(){
        engineRunning = true;
    }

    public void stop(){
        engineRunning = false;
    }

    public void blowHorn(){
        System.out.println("Beep Beep!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
public class SemiTruck {

    private String make;
    private String model;
    private boolean engineRunning;

    public SemiTruck(String make, String model){
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.engineRunning = false;
    }

    public void start(){
        engineRunning = true;
    }

    public void stop(){
        engineRunning = false;
    }

    public void blowHorn(){
        System.out.println("bwwAAAAAAHHHHH!!");
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>
    These classes work just fine, but we have quite a bit of duplicate code which is a sign that we could be doing
    something better. In fact, we could add a multitude of methods that would be the same for both of these classes
    (accelerate, brake, turn on radio, getters/setters, etc). Besides the extra
    typing (or cut and paste) involved in writing these classes, it's also more difficult to make changes to the common
    code since we have to be careful to change it in both classes. Even worse, imagine if we had 10 similar classes that
    all have the same shared code. We would like a way to eliminate this duplicate code by writing it once and allowing
    each class to use the shared code.
</p>

<p>
    In cases like this we will factor out the common code into a new class that will be inherited by both of these
    classes. The purpose of the third class is to store all the common code in one place so it can be easily maintained.
    With this setup we could have any number of classes inheriting the common class and still only have to make a single
    change to alter the behavior of all the inheriting classes. Let's explore an example of this using abstract classes.
</p>



== Abstract Classes


<p>
    To apply inheritance to the example from the previous section we will create what's called an abstract class. An
    abstract class is a class that is only partially defined and cannot be instantiate. We will add all our common
    code into an abstract class and leave the code specific to the two classes undefined.
</p>

<div class="deeper-dive" data-concept="class" data-topic="instance-variables"></div>

<pre><code class="java">
public abstract class Vehicle {

    private String make;
    private String model;
    private boolean engineRunning;

    public Vehicle(String make, String model){
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.engineRunning = false;
    }

    public void start(){
        engineRunning = true;
    }

    public void stop(){
        engineRunning = false;
    }

    public abstract void blowHorn();

}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
public class Car extends Vehicle{

    public Car(String make, String model) {
        super(make, model);
    }

    @Override
    public void blowHorn(){
        System.out.println("Beep Beep!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
public class SemiTruck extends Vehicle{

    public SemiTruck(String make, String model) {
        super(make, model);
    }

    @Override
    public void blowHorn(){
        System.out.println("bwwAAAAAAHHHHH!!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now we have a abstract Vehicle class that will store the common code for any type of Vehicle. We make this class as
    abstract explicitly with the abstract keyword, as well as any abstract methods. We see that the blowHorn method
    <code>public abstract void blowHorn();</code> is not defined in Vehicle and is marked as abstract. This method is
    left to the inheriting classes to define. In our Car and SemiTruck classes we inherit the abstract Vehicle class
    using the keyword <code>extends</code>. This add all the member variables and methods from the Vehicle class into
    these classes as well as adding the requirement that these classes implement the blowHorn method. We implement this
    method by overriding any previous definition using the @Override annotation.
</p>

<p>
    We also see that we have explicit constructors for each of the inhering classes with the line
    <code>super(make, model);</code>. Unless we're using the default constructor, this is a necessary addition to these
    classes. This defines a constructor for each class that will call the constructor from the class it is extending
    using the super keyword. The keyword <code>super</code> functions the same way as <code>this</code> except it refers
    to the extended class instead of the current class.
</p>

<h5>Vocabulary:</h5>
<dl>
    <dt>Super Class</dt>
    <dd>The class being extended</dd>
    <dt>Sub Class</dt>
    <dd>The class extending another class</dd>
    <dt>Abstract Class</dt>
    <dd>An incomplete class that cannot be instantiated</dd>
    <dt>Concrete Class</dt>
    <dd>A complete class that can be instantiated</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    With our classes extended a common abstract class we can now use all the shared methods without redefining them for
    each class.
</p>

<pre><code class="Java">
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car("Ford", "Focus");
        SemiTruck semi = new SemiTruck("Mac", "Pinnacle");

        car.start();
        semi.start();

        car.blowHorn();
        semi.blowHorn();

        car.stop();
        semi.stop();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<kbd>Beep Beep!<br/>bwwAAAAAAHHHHH!!</kbd>


== Class Hierarchy

<p>
    Every class in java extends exactly 1 other class, with only 1 exception. The
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html">Object</a> class.
</p>

<p>
    In order to avoid name conflicts, a class can only extend 1 other other class. If multiple classes can be extended
    we risk facing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem">deadly diamond
    of death</a>.
    This occurs when 2 or more inherited classes contain different definitions for the same member variable or method.
    When this variable or method is accessed in the sub class, which definition should be used? To avoid this, java
    forbids extending multiple classes
</p>

<p>
    On the other side, every new class must extend another class. If a class is not explicitly extended by a new class,
    it automatically extends the Object class. Even if a class extends another class, it can be traced back to the
    object class by repeatedly looking at the extended class. We might have to look at the super class of the super
    classes super class... but we will eventually reach the Object class. As a result, every java class is connected
    through the <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html">class
    hierarchy</a> the methods in the Object class are inherited by every single java class ever. We can now rely on
    every class containing these methods, and we can override them in our classes to achieve our desired behaviour. So
    what are these methods? Let's look at 3 of these methods that are commonly overridden:
</p>

<h5>Object methods:</h5>
<dl>
    <dt>String toString()</dt>
    <dd>Defines how an instance of the class is represented as a String, typically to be printed to the console.</dd>
    <dt>boolean equals(Object obj)</dt>
    <dd>Determine if this instance is equal to another Object.</dd>
    <dt>int hashCode()</dt>
    <dd>Returns a hash value correlated to this instance. For proper behavior, hashCode must be overridden if equals is
        overridden such that if 2 instance are equal according to the equals method they must also have the same
        hashCode (the reverse does not have to be true).
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    These methods are not abstract in Object so they do have default behaviors that can be used if we don't need to
    customize our classes. In this course you will only need to override toString(), though it's helpful to know that
    you can override the other methods as well.
</p>


== Interfaces

<p>
    An interface is similar to an abstract class except it cannot contain any instance variables or methods. The
    only non-static content an interface can contain are abstract methods. In essence, an interface is a contract that
    says any class inheriting the interface must implement all the abstract methods from the interface.
</p>


<pre><code class="java">
public interface Edible {

    int getCalories();
    String getRecommendedMeal();

}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
public class Waffle implements Edible{

    private int calories;
    private String meal;

    public Waffle(int calories) {
        this.calories = calories;
        this.meal = "breakfast";
    }

    @Override
    public int getCalories() {
        return this.calories;
    }

    @Override
    public String getRecommendedMeal() {
        return this.meal;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
public class Cake implements Edible{

    private static int caloriesPerPiece = 280;
    private static String meal = "dessert";
    private int pieces;

    public Cake(int pieces){
        this.pieces = pieces;
    }

    public void eatPiece(){
        if(this.pieces > 0){
            this.pieces--;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getCalories() {
        return this.pieces * Cake.caloriesPerPiece;
    }

    @Override
    public String getRecommendedMeal() {
        return Cake.meal;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Waffle waffle = new Waffle(200);
        Cake cake = new Cake(8);

        System.out.println("Eat waffles for " + waffle.getRecommendedMeal());
        System.out.println("Eat cake for " + cake.getRecommendedMeal());
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("The waffle has " + waffle.getCalories() + " calories");
        System.out.println("The cake has " + cake.getCalories() + " calories");

        cake.eatPiece();
        cake.eatPiece();
        cake.eatPiece();

        System.out.println("\nThe cake has " + cake.getCalories() + " calories");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<kbd>Eat waffles for breakfast<br/>Eat cake for dessert<br/><br/>The waffle has 200 calories<br/>The cake has 2240
    calories<br/><br/>The cake has 1400 calories</kbd>
<br/>
<p>
    In this example we have Edible as an interface that is inherited by two classes, Waffle and Cake. To inherit an
    interface we use the keyword implements instead of extends like we did with abstract classes. When each of these
    classes implements the Edible interface, they are responsible for implementing all the abstract methods from this
    interface. We can see that both classes implement these methods, but they each take different approaches to
    accomplish this. This is very important! When a class implements an interface we don't have to understand
    <em>how</em>
    it implements the interface methods, only <em>that</em> it implements them. When working with instances of these
    classes we will rely on the getCalories() and getRecommendedMeal() methods being available and returning the correct
    values,
    but we don't have to ask how they arrived at those values. We might be curious and want to see how these classes are
    implemented, but more often we are working with projects that can be hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of
    lines of code. We simply cannot understand every implementation detail throughout a codebase of that magnitude and
    will rely on these methods working as defined by the interface. Need to use a class that inherits a known interface?
    You have a guarantee that you can call the interface methods without reading the source code.
</p>

<p>
    So why would we ever use an interface instead of an abstract class if interfaces do the same thing but are more
    limited? The answer is multiple inheritance. While a class can only extend 1 abstract class due to potential
    definition and name conflicts, a class can implement any number of interfaces. Since variables and method
    definitions can't be inherited through interfaces there can't be conflicts. If two interfaces contain identical
    abstract methods they can still both be inherited by the same class because the class only inherits a promise to
    implement the method. Implementing the method will satisfy both interfaces without conflict.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    We have used interfaces several times in this course without explicitly implementing. Recall this example of sorting
    String while ignoring case:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    words.add("Wing");
    words.add("cOach");
    words.add("kettle");
    words.add("camp");

    System.out.println(words);

    Collections.sort(words, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;(){
        @Override
        public int compare(String o1, String o2){
            return o1.compareToIgnoreCase(o2);
        }
    });

    System.out.println(words);
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example we used the Comparator interface to accomplish the custom sorting. The syntax we used is called
    creating an anonymous class since we implemented this interface without naming a new class. Now that we know about
    interfaces, let's write a comparator as a concrete class that implements Comparator.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class CompareIgnoreCase implements Comparator&lt;String&gt;{

    @Override
    public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
        return o1.compareToIgnoreCase(o2);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here we have a named concrete class that implements the Comparator interface to compare Strings. This interface
    contains only the compare method that takes two objects of the specified type. Using this class
    our sorting code is much more concise.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    Collections.sort(words, new CompareIgnoreCase());
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is especially useful if we want to perform the same custom sorting in many different places. As long as the
    second argument of the sort method is a class that implements Comparator with a type matching the data structure
    being sorted, the method will run. Inside the sort method, only the compare method is required to completely sort
    a data structure so the guarantee provided by the Comparator interface (ie. that the compare method will be
    implemented) is good enough for sort.
</p>

<p>
    But why stop there? Now that we have a complete class that can be used for sorting by implementing one method we can
    sort in any order we can dream up! Oooh it feels like the world is ours! Let's see an example of sorting ints by
    their distance to a particular int. You might think this is too much power for us to wield, but it's not like anyone
    can stop us!
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class CompareToInt implements Comparator&lt;Integer&gt;{

    private int reference;

    public CompareToInt(int reference){
        this.reference = reference;
    }

    @Override
    public int compare(Integer o1, Integer o2) {
        return distanceFromReference(o1) - distanceFromReference(o2);
    }

    private int distanceFromReference(int value){
        return Math.abs(value - this.reference);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.addAll(Arrays.asList(12, 5, -58, -48, 0, 60, 35, 100, 4));

        System.out.println(numbers);

        Collections.sort(numbers, new CompareToInt(10));
        System.out.println(numbers);

        Collections.sort(numbers, new CompareToInt(-50));
        System.out.println(numbers);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<kbd>[12, 5, -58, -48, 0, 60, 35, 100, 4]<br/>[12, 5, 4, 0, 35, 60, -48, -58, 100]<br/>[-48, -58, 0, 4, 5, 12, 35, 60,
    100]</kbd>
<br/>

<p>
    We can also rewrite other examples where we used anonymous classes in a similar way. We've also used the interfaces
    <code>ActionListener</code> and <code>KeyListener</code> that were used by GUI elements. The GUI elements would call
    one of the interface methods when particular events occurred. The GUI itself isn't concerned with the contents of
    those methods, it just knows that the methods will be there and that when to call them. By defining these listeners
    as named classes we can add the same behavior to multiple GUI elements (or multiple GUIs) without duplicating code.
</p>


== Polymorphism

<p>
    Polymorphism is another major advantage of object-oriented programming. We are using polymorphism when we refer to a
    class by one of its inherited super classes or interfaces. A instance of any class is also an instance of every
    class and interface that it inherits. This allows us to store an instance of a class in a variable of any one of its
    types. Let's see an example using our Edible classes:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Edible waffle = new Waffle(200);
        Edible cake = new Cake(8);

        System.out.println("Eat waffles for " + waffle.getRecommendedMeal());
        System.out.println("Eat cake for " + cake.getRecommendedMeal());
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("The waffle has " + waffle.getCalories() + " calories");
        System.out.println("The cake has " + cake.getCalories() + " calories");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here we store instances of the Waffle and Cake class in variables of type Edible. There are no compiler errors here
    and we can happily call any methods from the Edible interface. However, we can no longer call the eatPiece() method
    from the Cake class since it is not part of the Edible interface. The Edible variables do not know about the Cake
    class and any extra methods it declared so we cannot call the additional methods from an Edible variable. We could
    take this all the way up the inheritance hierarchy and store every instance of any class in a variable of type
    Object, but we would only be able to call methods defined in the Object class. For this reason, we typically use the
    most specific type for our variable, but there are cases where we don't mind losing functionality in order to gain
    flexibility. Consider a bakery that wants to track how many total calories it has in stock (I'm not sure why, they
    just do). For this we will use a very powerful ability of polymorphism. Data structures of mixed types.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList&lt;Edible&gt; edibles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        edibles.add(new Waffle(201));
        edibles.add(new Waffle(210));
        edibles.add(new Waffle(170));
        edibles.add(new Cake(8));
        edibles.add(new Cake(4));
        edibles.add(new Cake(16));

        int totalCalories = 0;
        for(Edible edible : edibles){
            totalCalories += edible.getCalories();
        }

        System.out.println("total calories: " + totalCalories);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<kbd>total calories: 8421</kbd>

<p>
    We have seemingly done the impossible. We have Waffles and Cakes stored in a single ArrayList. We can manipulate
    any of the elements in this ArrayList as long as we only use methods defined in the Edible interface. Only classes
    that implement the Edible interface can be added to this ArrayList, and since all those classes must implement the
    methods in that interface we can safely call them on every object in the ArrayList.
</p>

<p>
    By using the Edible interface we are using a practice known as "coding to the interface." It is generally good
    practice to use variable types that are higher up the class hierarchy as long as any additional methods (such as
    eatPiece()) are not needed. It may be tempting for a bakery to store its inventory in an ArrayList of Waffles and an
    ArrayList of Cakes, but this code would be difficult to maintain if more foods are added. If the bakery wants to
    expand into Crepes, Muffins, and Pies they would need 3 more ArrayLists with additional code every time the entire
    inventory is needed and we already know that duplicating code like this is bad. Instead, store them all in one
    ArrayList of Edibles and maintenance is simple. Create the new classes, implement Edible, add the new inventory to
    the existing ArrayList. Custom classes and easy storage.
</p>
