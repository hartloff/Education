-snag submissions
-tell me what new tech you've learned
-ethics discussions
-impact discussions
-legal discussions
-guest speakers and panels
-individual presentation (teach us something you've learned) (should be vetted. Give the presentation to me for approval) (maybe they apply and interview for the spots! No fixed number of spots so it's not a curve)


== Objectives

<ul>
    <li>Apply software engineering principles outside of your team project</li>
    <li>Explore non-technical aspects of software engineering</li>
    <!--<li>(e) An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities</li>-->
    <!--<li>(g) An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society</li>-->
</ul>

== Lecture

<p>
    Many lectures will involve interactive activities. These activities are designed to help you understand and apply
    various aspects of software engineering. We will also explore software engineering as a whole and discuss it's role
    in society.
</p>

<p>
    These activities will not exist exist outside of lecture and you must attend lecture to earn credit for them.
    Attempting to earn credit for an activity without being physically present in lecture is an
    academic integrity violation and [if caught] will result in a F in the course. A variety of methods will be used to
    detect violators. Do not test this unless you are comfortable with an F.
</p>


== Grading

<p>
    Each activity is graded on a binary scale. You either completed the activity, or you didn't. The effect on your
    final grade will be determined by the number of incomplete activities with grade changes following the same scale as
    given in the syllabus. This will be a very rare case where you have a clearly defined way to improve your grade.
</p>


<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny text-center">
    <tr>
        <td>Incomplete Activities</td>
        <td>Grade Change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1-3</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4-5</td>
        <td>-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6-7</td>
        <td>-2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8+</td>
        <td>-3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    *If the response rate on the course evaluations is at least 99%, all cutoff values for incomplete activities will be
    increased by 1. This would mean that missing 0-1 activities would result in +1, miss 2-4 for 0, etc.
</p>

== Make Up

<p>
    For each activity there will be a make up opportunity for any student who <b>attended lecture</b> and attempted the
    activity, but was unable to successfully complete it. No make ups will be given to student who either missed
    lecture, or were present but did not make an honest effort to complete the activity.
</p>

<p>
    The intent of these activities is to further your understanding of software engineering, not cause stress
    about completing each activity. Take your time, relax, and use the make up opportunities if needed.
