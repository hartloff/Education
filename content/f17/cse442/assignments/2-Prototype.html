== Objective
<ul>
    <li>Develop a prototype</li>
    <li>Effectively use git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Perform code reviews</li>
    <li>Work as a team</li>
</ul>

== Prototype

<div class="requirement alert alert-success">
    <b>Practical Objective</b>: Develop a running prototype that, by itself (no documentation or video required), clearly and simply conveys
    the idea
    of the final product to a non-technical audience. The prototype is also easy to run for a technical user.
    Instructions for access should be provided in the README for the project (see the README requirement of the MVP
    phase).<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will "spin up" your prototype by following the README and a non-technical user
    will will be given the prototype and asked what it is supposed to do. The users description must match the stated
    idea for the project, within reason. The non-technical user will not be given any
    information outside of your prototype (They will not be shown the README, prototype video, project page, etc. Only
    the running code). If there is any difficulty at all in this process then this requirement is not met.<br/>
    <b>Note</b>: Practical objectives will be very difficult to achieve throughout this course. Final grading decisions
    will be
    made by the course instructor and these decisions will be strict. Close does not count for these objectives.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Develop a running prototype of your project that shows the idea of the final
    product.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that the prototype accurately shows your project idea. This verification is
    much less strict than the corresponding practical objective and may be checked through your video and not by running
    your prototype.
</div>
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release of your prototype on GitHub as "v0.1.0"<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page
</div>


<p>
    Your prototype will be working software that runs and gives the customer a clear vision of your final product. No
    functionality is required and most of the focus will be on the visuals. For example, you might have buttons that do
    not perform any actions, but it should be clear what the button will do after the software is developed and
    released. This
    prototype will become your final product by the end of the semester after your team implements all the
    functionality.

    <!--Team members responsible for the view and-->
    <!--architecture may have more work than other members at this stage. Back-end team members can treat this as 4 weeks to-->
    <!--deliver the MVP.-->
</p>

<p>
    To finalize the prototype it must be merged into your master branch and be tagged as release "v0.1.0" on GitHub.
</p>


<!--<p>-->
<!--Each individual effort doesn't have to be substantial, but the processes needs to be followed! This sprint is mostly-->
<!--about process.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Recommended: Have one group member build the base of the program and establish develop/master before the rest of the-->
<!--group starts creating feature branches. This will make the pull requests and reviews much simpler.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Version Control-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Recommended: Create test repositories and play around with git/GitHub features. Don't break the team repo.-->
<!--</p>-->


== YouTube Video
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your prototype to YouTube.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements
</div>
<p>
    In addition to creating a release on GitHub you will also produce a video demo of your prototype and upload it to
    YouTube. This video must give an accurate demo of the current state of your
    project and show the running prototype. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience to give people
    an idea of what you are going to accomplish this semester. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 1 minute. The goal is
    to quickly communicate your idea to the end users.
</p>

<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your prototype video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that
    the video is displayed properly.
</p>

<form action="/courses/cse442-f17/submit-video/prototype" method="post">

        <label>Video Link:</label>
        <input type="text" name="link"/>

    <div>

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Did not complete prototype and release as "v0.1.0" on GitHub-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | No video submission, video does not show the working prototype, or video is longer than 1 minute-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Prototype and video together do not give a clear vision of the final product-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--The following pitfalls will apply for the remainder of the semester (including this submission).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Not following the proper processes including the branching model, pull requests, code reviews, etc.-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Failure to complete an assigned task. To be considered complete the code for a task must be reviewed,-->
<!--accepted, and merged into develop. If the code is part of the current release it must also be merged into master.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--These points stack so if someone doesn't do anything for an entire submission [and they had a task assigned to them]-->
<!--they will receive a -2, or worse.-->
