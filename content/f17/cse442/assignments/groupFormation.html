== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Form a team and choose a project</li>
</ul>

== Overview and Advice

<div class="alert alert-info">Choose a project that interests you.</div>

<p>
    Groups must be formed halfway through sprint 1 allowing for 1.5 weeks to form groups, though it is recommended that
    you form groups before this deadline to allow more time to complete the prototype and video for sprint 1. In
    addition to missing the two points below, students who do not choose a group will all be placed in the same group.
    If this "default group" has less than 3 members the group may be modified at the discretion of the course staff.
    After groups are formed, they may change throughout the semester as long as all members of all groups involved are
    in
    agreement and no group drops below 3 members.
</p>

<p>
    The most important decision you will make in this course is choosing a project and it is the first decision that is
    made as a group. It is highly recommended that you take this decision seriously and have a group debate if
    necessary. Students from prior iterations of this course can confirm that a poor choice in project can ruin the
    experience and excitement of this course. It is recommended that you form groups around projects and interests as opposed to
    forming groups and then discussing project ideas.
</p>


== Form a Group and choose a Project (1 point)

<h4>
    <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/lo3fB9gjsD9bvqcC2">https://goo.gl/forms/lo3fB9gjsD9bvqcC2</a>
</h4>

<p>
    Submit project proposal along with your group members using the form above. Only one member of the group needs to submit. Individuals
    will
    only get points if they are in a group that has been submitted.
</p>

<p>
    You have freedom to choose your group members and project idea under two conditions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Groups must have at least 3 members.</li>
    <li>Projects must be substantial enough to justify a group of seniors working for an entire semester.</li>
</ul>


== Create a Slack Channels (1 Point)

<p>
    <b>Public Channel:</b> Create a public slack channel for your group on CSE Software (<a href="https://cse-software.slack.com/">https://cse-software.slack.com/</a>)
    and add a short channel description listing your group
    members
    and a description of your projects. This will be your primary channel for group communication.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Private Channel:</b> Also create a private Slack channel and add your group members and course staff to the channel. This private channel
    will only be used for sensitive communication with the course staff.
</p>
<p>
    Slack will be used by the course staff for all communication regarding this course. You are responsible for the
    information posted on Slack.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    It is highly recommended that you download and install a client for Slack and turn on notifications.
