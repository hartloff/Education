== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Complete an MVP</li>
</ul>

== Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

<p>
    <em>
        Goal: Develop functional software that is ready for use.
    </em>
</p>

<p>
    Nothing has to be polished in the MVP, but it MUST work. A user must be able to use your software for the purpose
    stated in the design document. No add-on features are required. The interface doesn't have to be clean, but again it
    needs to be functional.
</p>

<p>
    To finalize your MVP it must be merged into your master branch and be tagged as release "v0.2.0" on GitHub.
</p>

== Readme

<p>
    Add a readme to your project describing how to install your software from source. You can assume these
    readers have coding experience. You should include any relevant
    instructions such as installing dependencies and how compile/run the code. Do not skip any details needed for a
    programmer to get from cloning your repo to running your software. Once it's running you can assume the user can
    follow your video to learn to how to use the software so usage instructions are not necessary.
</p>

== YouTube Video

<p>
    As with the prototype, you must also complete a video demo of your MVP and upload it to YouTube. This video must
    show a working demo of all features in your MVP as described in your team contract. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes. The goal is
    to demo your functioning software to the end users.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your MVP video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that the video is displayed properly.

<div class="demerit">
    <strong>-1</strong> | Did not complete MVP and release as "v0.2.0" on GitHub
</div>

<div class="demerit">
    <strong>-1</strong> | Readme instructions are not clear or steps are missing
</div>

<div class="demerit">
    <strong>-1</strong> | No video submission, video does not show all the functionality in the team contract, or video
    is longer than 2 minutes
</div>


<div class="demerit">
    <strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Not following the proper processes including the branching model, pull requests,
    code reviews, etc.
</div>
<div class="demerit">
    <strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Failure to complete an assigned task. To be considered complete the code for a
    task must be reviewed,
    accepted, and merged into develop. If the code is part of the current release it must also be merged into master.
