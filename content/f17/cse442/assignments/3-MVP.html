== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Complete an MVP</li>
</ul>

== Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

<div class="requirement alert alert-success">
    <b>Practical Objective</b>: Deliver a bug-free and great MVP<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will follow your readme to run your software and use it. If there are any issues or
    bugs at
    all, this objective has not been met. Your software should seem as if it's ready for release and use for its
    intended purpose. It must be easy and intuitive to use without any supporting documentation.
</div>


<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Develop functional software that is ready for use.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will verify that your software delivers the stated MVP functionality from the team
    contract.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release of your MVP on GitHub as "v0.2.0"<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page
</div>
<p>
    Nothing has to be polished in the MVP, but it MUST work. A user must be able to use your software for the purpose
    stated in the design document. No add-on features are required. The interface doesn't have to be clean, but again it
    needs to be functional.
</p>

<p>
    To finalize your MVP it must be merged into your master branch and be tagged as release "v0.2.0" on GitHub.
</p>

== Readme

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Write a readme for your project.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will follow the <b>exactly</b> and check if your software runs.
</div>

<p>
    Add a readme to your project describing how to install your software from source. You can assume these
    readers have coding experience. You should include any relevant
    instructions such as installing dependencies, how compile/run the code, and any platform on which it will or will
    not function. Do not skip any details needed for a
    programmer to get from cloning your repo to running your software. Once it's running you can assume the user can
    follow your video to learn to how to use the software so usage instructions are not necessary.
</p>

== YouTube Video
<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your MVP to YouTube.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements
</div>
<p>
    As with the prototype, you must also complete a video demo of your MVP and upload it to YouTube. This video must
    show a working demo of all features in your MVP as described in your team contract. This video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes. The goal is
    to demo your functioning software to the end users.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your MVP video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that the video is displayed properly.
</p>

<form action="/courses/cse442-f17/submit-video/mvp" method="post">
    <div>
        <label>Video Link:</label>
        <input type="text" name="link"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>

<!--== Pitfalls-->

<!--<div class="gold-star">-->
<!--Group: MVP is amazing! Must present the project in class.-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<div class="gold-star">-->
<!--Individual: MVP is amazing AND a substantial amount of the work was completed by an individual(s).-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Did not complete MVP and release as "v0.2.0" on GitHub-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Readme instructions are not clear or steps are missing-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | No video submission, video does not show all the functionality in the team contract, or video-->
<!--is longer than 2 minutes-->
<!--</div>-->


<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Not following the proper processes including the branching model, pull requests,-->
<!--code reviews, etc.-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<div class="demerit">-->
<!--<strong>-1</strong> | Individual: Failure to complete an assigned task. To be considered complete the code for a-->
<!--task must be reviewed,-->
<!--accepted, and merged into develop. If the code is part of the current release it must also be merged into master.-->
