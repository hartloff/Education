== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Release version 1.0</li>
    <li>Finalize the project and deployment</li>
    <li>Finalize documentation</li>
    <li>Release video</li>
    <li>You are held strongly accountable for your product after this</li>
</ul>


== Release

<p>
    Complete your project, release it as "v1.0.0" on GitHub, and maintain a live deployment of your software. You will
    release your software with the add-on feature completed in the previous phase which will replace your beta release.
    This will be the official release of your software and the last release for this course. For the remainder of the
    semester you must maintain this release and support your users.
</p>

<!--<p>-->
<!--Address any bug reports created by beta testers. Make sure everything is functional for this release.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    For the official release, all documentation must be current and clear. Revise the readme, wiki, and landing page as
    needed.
</p>

<p>
    Note that technically there are no new requirements for this phase of the project. If your team has been completing
    all their task throughout the semester this may be a relaxing 2 weeks.
</p>
<!--<p>-->
<!--Not necessary for everyone to do work this sprint (ie. if you've been doing everything you should be in sprints 1-5-->
<!--then there won't be anything to do here).-->
<!--Each group member will be responsible for their area in the release. For example, If-->
<!--there's no sound, or buggy sound, in the release then the sound person takes a hit. If the user docs suck, the user-->
<!--doc person takes a hit.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--= Deployment (4 Points)-->

<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
<!--Someone with no programming experience must be able to access and use your software for-->
<!--its intended purpose.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--The finished software has been deployed and publicly available on the Internet. Exact details for deployment will-->
<!--vary between projects. Specific-->
<!--deployment strategies for-->
<!--each group will be discussed during the group meetings with the course staff.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Deployment strategies will fall into one of two-->
<!--main categories, monetized and open-source. If you choose to monetize, deployment will require that interested-->
<!--investors-->
<!--and/or customers have a way to give you money for your project. If your group chooses not to monetize, the project-->
<!--must be open-source and available on GitHub in-->
<!--addition to deploying the finished software for anyone to use.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<p>-->
<!--Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses to monetize include:-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
<!--<li>Release your software for sale on a publicly available platform (ex. Steam)</li>-->
<!--<li>Start a crowd funding campaign (ex. KickStarter)</li>-->
<!--<li>Deliver a VC pitch to potential investors</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses <b>not</b> to monetize include:-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
<!--<li>Host your software for free on a publicly available platform (ex. Kongregate)</li>-->
<!--<li>Host your software as a stand-alone web app</li>-->
<!--<li>Submit a research paper based on results produced by your software to a research conference or-->
<!--journal-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>Host binaries for simple installation on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu. Having users install from your source code is-->
<!--not acceptable.-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->


== Release Video

<p>
    One last video. No time requirements this time. You decide how you want to present your final product. This is the
    last video submission so this is the one you will want to show to potential employers. Your future self will thank
    the team if this video is great.
</p>
<!--= Release Video (4 Points)-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Upload a video about your software. There is no time criteria for this video. There are no requirements for what-->
<!--needs to be contained in this video. As long as a video is uploaded, these 4 points will awarded to the group.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--You are encouraged to put time and thought into how you present this version of your software to the world. This-->
<!--video is a representation of your group and the work you have completed this semester. It can be a powerful tool-->
<!--while-->
<!--networking and searching for jobs to show other what you're capable of accomplishing as part of a team (which is-->
<!--what companies want to hire you to do). The grading criteria will step out of the way here so you can choose how you-->
<!--want to-->
<!--present your work, and yourselves, to others in the technical industry.-->
<!--</p>-->

    code reviews, etc.
</div>
