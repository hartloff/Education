== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Contribute to another group's project</li>
    <li>On-board outside help</li>
    <li>Complete at least 1 add-on feature</li>
    <li>Respond to beta testers</li>
</ul>


== Overview

<p>
    For the last submission you setup beta testing and on boarding to invite other people into your project. Now it's
    time to interact with those people. Scary, huh!
</p>

<!--== Preparing your tasks-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Create a github issue with a label that it's for outside help. Give clear instructions in the ticket about what-->
<!--needs to be completed and where the code should be written. Give any details about the project structure you think-->
<!--will be necessary in the project's readme or wiki. In the issue, also mark who should be assigned as the code-->
<!--reviewer(s) for the pull request.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--[Could have bounties on some difficult tasks]-->
<!--</p>-->

== Outside Help

<p>
    Developer's outside of your team will be completing your tasks marked for outside during this phase of the project.
    It is the team's responsibility to on board these developers and assist them in their task if they encounter any
    problems.
</p>

<p>
    The outside developers must follow the proper procedure to contribute to your project. This includes forking your
    repository, branching appropriately (as defined by your team. It's acceptable to setup their branch for them),
    create a pull request with the proper reviewer(s) assigned, and respond to any comments or requests on the pull
    request. After the code is approved, your team will merge the code into develop (and master when it's ready for
    release).
</p>

<p>
    You may be asked to provide feedback on the contribution and level of effort given by the outside developers.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Do not add outside developers as collaborators on your repository! They must fork your repository instead.
</div>

== Contributing to a Project

<p>
    In addition to accepting an outside contribution for your project, every team member must complete 2 tasks marked
    for
    outside help for another team in the class. One of these tasks will be assigned by the course staff and the other
    will be chosen by you following the conditions below. The same procedure as above must be followed, except you will
    be the
    contributor for another team's project.
</p>

<p>
    The following conditions must be met for your chosen task:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You cannot choose a task for your own team (This should be obvious, but is included for completeness)
    </li>
    <li>
        You cannot choose a task from the same team as your assigned task
    </li>
    <li>
        You cannot choose a task from a team for which any of your other group members are completing a task, whether
        they chose that task or it is assigned. You will also not be assigned tasks for the same team. This implies that
        if you have 4 team members, in total your team will complete tasks for 8 other teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        You cannot choose a task that has already been claimed by someone else (check the comments on the issue)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To choose a task, open the issue in GitHub and post a comment stating your intent. Not that you cannot be assigned
    the task since you will not be a contributor on their project. By leaving a comment you will signal your intent to
    the team and to other students in the class.
</p>

<p>
    You may be asked to provide feedback about the on boarding process of the other teams.
</p>


== New Feature

<p>
    <!--There are no requirements for how much work the outside help needs to complete (as long as it's meaningful), however-->
    Your team must deliver at least one add-on feature in addition to your MVP for this submission. You can choose from
    any of the add-on features you've listed on your team contract.
</p>


== Beta Testing

<p>
    While you are collaborating with outside help, contributing to other projects, and developing an add-on feature your
    team must also respond to and support your beta testers and beta test other project (Yes, this will be a very busy 2
    weeks).
</p>

<h4>
    Beta Testing
</h4>
<p>
    You must beta test 6 other projects during this phase of the project. The project you'll beta test will be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The two project for which you are completing tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two projects to which you are assigned by the course staff.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two additional projects of your choosing. There are no additional criteria for your choices except that they
        cannot include your own project.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Beta Testers
</h4>

<p>
    Throughout this phase there will be beta testers testing your beta release. You must respond to any bug report and
    fix
    any major bugs reported by the testers,
    especially if it prevent them from running and testing your beta release (ie. your web app is offline or returning
    500:ISE errors or your executable doesn't run on the advertised environments). Any bug fixes (hot fixes in this
    case) must follow proper
    protocols (tracked as a GitHub issue, branch from master, pull request + review, merge into master and develop). You
    must also be responsive to requests and comments from beta testers in your public Ryver channel.
</p>

== YouTube Video
<p>
    Finally, you must submit a new video showing the current state of your project with a functional add-on feature.
    This add-on feature does not have to appear in your released software, there is no tagged release, and the video can
    be produced in your development environment from the develop branch (master is reserved for your beta
    release/production code). As with the previous videos, this video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minute. The goal is
    to quickly demo your new feature to the end users.

<!--== Overview-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--You've put in 12 weeks of hard work to complete a great project. Now it's time to share your work with the world!-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Group Points-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--All point for this sprint are graded on a group basis. All group members will share the same grade.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--= Project Completion (4 Points)-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--The project is stable and ready for release. There must not be any major bugs and the software is usable for its-->
<!--intended purpose.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--If previous sprints went well, these points will be automatic. If there were significant issues throughout the-->
<!--previous sprints that have not been rectified then these points will not be awarded.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--= Documentation (4 Points)-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--The project is appropriately documented with enough detail for a user to understand how to use your software with no-->
<!--information other than documentation. The type and extent of documentation required will vary greatly between-->
<!--projects. Requirements for each group will be discussed during the group meetings with the course staff. It is-->
<!--recommended that you start writing documentation early and check with the course staff if the documentation is-->
<!--appropriate.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--For open-source projects, the documentation should be contained in the repo's README file and wiki pages.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Partial credit may be awarded at the discretion of the course staff.-->
