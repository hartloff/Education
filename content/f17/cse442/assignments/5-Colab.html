== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Contribute to another group's project</li>
    <li>On-board outside help</li>
    <li>Complete at least 1 add-on feature</li>
    <li>Respond to beta testers</li>
</ul>

== Practical Objective
<p>
    <b>Objective</b>: Collaborate with professionalism. This objective will be assessed on an individual
    basis, though there
    are various team accomplishments that will help individuals meet this goal (ex. clear on boarding documentation).
<hr/>
<b>Verify</b>: The course staff will verify that you've done exceptional and professional work on the 4
collaboration aspects of this phase. These are, contributing to another team, assisting anyone completing tasks
in your area of the project, beta testing other projects, and responding to beta testers of your own project. All 4
of these aspects must be performed without issues caused by the individual being assessed. All interactions with other students must be professional and the
communication must be clear. Beta testing feedback must be helpful and constructive. Code contributions must be bug
free and clearly complete the assigned task. Students testing and contributing to your project must have a clear idea of
what to do and have their questions answered promptly if they arise. Since much of this can depend on other
students, this objective can be met even if a criteria is not met if the course staff determines that the fault lies
solely with the other student and there was no way to resolve the issue. However, resolving a difficult
situation may increase your chances of achieving this objective.
<hr/>
<b>Note</b>: Feedback from students may be used as evidence for grading decisions, but will not directly
determine any grades.
</p>

== Overview


<p>
    For the last submission you setup beta testing and on boarding to invite other people into your project. Now it's
    time to interact with those people. This phase of the project will divide you into 5 different roles.
    <!--Scary, huh!-->
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Helping another team on their project</li>
    <li>On boarding outside help on your project</li>
    <li>Beta testing other projects</li>
    <li>Responding to beta testers on your own project</li>
    <li>Developing an add-on feature on your project</li>
</ul>


<!--== Preparing your tasks-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Create a github issue with a label that it's for outside help. Give clear instructions in the ticket about what-->
<!--needs to be completed and where the code should be written. Give any details about the project structure you think-->
<!--will be necessary in the project's readme or wiki. In the issue, also mark who should be assigned as the code-->
<!--reviewer(s) for the pull request.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--[Could have bounties on some difficult tasks]-->
<!--</p>-->

== Outside Help

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: On board outside developers. Do not add them as collaborators on your repository.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will determine if the on boarding process was appropriate to bring in a new
    developer and that the team communicated effectively with these developers.
</div>

<p>
    Developer's outside of your team will be completing your tasks marked for outside help during this phase of the
    project.
    It is the team's responsibility to on board these developers and assist them as they navigate your code base. For
    questions specific to the task, the team member who created the task must assist the developer.
</p>

<p>
    The outside developers must follow the proper procedure to contribute to your project. This includes forking your
    repository, branching appropriately (as defined by your team. It's acceptable to setup their branch for them),
    creating a pull request with the proper reviewer(s) assigned, and responding to any comments or requests on the pull
    request. After the code is approved, your team can merge the code into develop.
</p>

<p>
    You may be asked to provide feedback on the contribution and level of effort given by the outside developers.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Do not add outside developers as collaborators on your repository! They must fork your repository instead.
</div>

== Contributing to a Project

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Complete your assigned task for another team.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will determine if the task has been sufficiently completed. Feedback from the on
    boarding team may be collected to assist with the grading decision. In extreme cases this requirement can be
    lessened if the on boarding team has been difficult (ex. If your assigned task is very substantial, the team's
    wiki is unclear, and their codebase is disorganized). Even for difficult tasks, you must show that you've made a
    substantial effort to learn the code base and complete it. Note that this will be difficult even with an easy task
    and great on boarding.
</div>

<p>
    In addition to accepting an outside contribution for your project, every team member must complete a task marked
    for
    outside help for another team in the class. This task will be assigned by the course staff. The on boarding
    procedures apply here except you will
    be the contributor for another team's project instead of the on boarding team.
</p>


== New Feature

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Develop at least one add-on feature for your project.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that a feature has been added and is functional. You should not deploy
    this new feature (Changes to the release can disrupt your beta testers). Instead, keep the new feature on the
    develop branch.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Create a release from the develop branch on GitHub as "v0.4.0"
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This release will appear on your project page.
</div>
<p>
    <!--There are no requirements for how much work the outside help needs to complete (as long as it's meaningful), however-->
    Your team must deliver at least one add-on feature in addition to your MVP for this submission. You can choose from
    any of the add-on features you've listed on your team contract.
</p>
<p>
    This version of your project must be merged into your develop branch and be tagged as release
    "v0.4.0" on GitHub.
</p>


<!--<p>-->
<!--The following conditions must be met for your chosen task:-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--You cannot choose a task for your own team (This should be obvious, but is included for completeness)-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--You cannot choose a task from the same team as your assigned task-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--You cannot choose a task from a team for which any of your other group members are completing a task, whether-->
<!--they chose that task or it is assigned. You will also not be assigned tasks for the same team. This implies that-->
<!--if you have 4 team members, in total your team will complete tasks for 8 other teams.-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--You cannot choose a task that has already been claimed by someone else (check the comments on the issue)-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--To choose a task, open the issue in GitHub and post a comment stating your intent. Not that you cannot be assigned-->
<!--the task since you will not be a contributor on their project. By leaving a comment you will signal your intent to-->
<!--the team and to other students in the class.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    You may be asked to provide feedback about the on boarding process of the other teams.
</p>


== Beta Testing

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Beta test at least 6 projects including the assigned project.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that you completed the beta testing procedure for all 6 projects.
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Respond to beta testers.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Your team must respond to any beta testers who contact the team or submit a bug report. If the course
    staff notice a message or bug report that goes unanswered then this objective has not been met.
</div>

<p>
    While you are collaborating with outside help, contributing to other projects, and developing an add-on feature your
    team must also respond to and support your beta testers and beta test other project (Yes, this will be a very busy 2
    weeks).
</p>

<h4>
    Beta Testing
</h4>
<p>
    You must beta test a total of 6 other projects during this phase of the project. The project you'll beta test will include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The project for which you are completing a task.
    </li>
    <li>
        Three projects assigned by the course staff.
    </li>
    <li>
        Additional projects of your choosing. There are no additional criteria for your choices except that they
        cannot include your own project and the total number of projects tested should be >= 6.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Beta Testers
</h4>

<p>
    Throughout this phase there will be beta testers testing your beta release. You must respond to any bug report and
    fix
    any major bugs reported by the testers,
    especially if it prevent them from running and testing your beta release (ie. your web app is offline or returning
    500:ISE errors or your executable doesn't run on the advertised platforms). You
    must also be responsive to requests and comments from beta testers in your public Ryver channel.
</p>

== Bug Fixes

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Technical Requirement</b>: Follow proper procedure for bug fixes.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The course staff will verify that the procedure has been followed.
</div>
<p>
    If and when a bug is found it must be tracked using GitHub issues and fixed if it is a major bug. Any bug
    fixes (hot fixes in this case) must follow proper
    procedures (tracked as a GitHub issue, branch from master, pull request + review, merge into master and
    develop). When a pull request is submitted you must
    reference the issue for the bug and close the issue once the request is approved. Be sure to use labels to mark this
    as a bug fix.
</p>


== YouTube Video

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Upload a video demo of your project to YouTube that is shorter than 2 minutes.
    <hr/>
    <b>Verify</b>: This video will appear on your project page. Course staff will verify that it meets the requirements
</div>

<p>
    Finally, you must submit a new video showing the current state of your project with a functional add-on feature.
    This add-on feature does not have to appear in your released software and the video can
    be produced in your development environment from the develop branch (master is reserved for your beta
    release/production code). As with the previous videos, this video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience. You should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minute. The goal is
    to quickly demo your new feature to the end users.
