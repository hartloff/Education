== Project and Team Formation

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Form or join a team.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: You name will be listed on the project page for your team
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Your choice of project will have a significant impact on your experience in this course.
</div>

<p>
    You are free to choose any software project you desire for this course.
</p>
<p>
    To help you find a project and team you can discuss ideas with other
    students in the course on Ryver We will also discuss project
    ideas during the first week of class.
</p>

<p>
    Whatever you choose for your project and team you must fulfill the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Teams must have 3-5 members
    </li>
    <li>
        Once your team is formed, create you project on the course website and fill in all required information
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you prefer to be placed in a random group, send an email to hartloff@buffalo.edu with "CSE442: Random Group" as
    the subject line. So long as it is mathematically possible to place all such students into groups of size 3-5, all
    students making such requests will be placed into groups together.
</p>


<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Form a team around a common interest or specific project idea. This course is much
    more enjoyable if
    the whole team is interested in the project.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Use caution when forming a team with 3 members. If a member resigns the course your
    may need to disband
    and join other teams mid-semester. If you have 3 members, make sure all three are dedicated to completing the
    course.
</div>

== Ryver

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Create a public team forum and a private team channel.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The river icon will appear on your project page which links to your public channel
</div>

<p>
    We will use Ryver as the primary means of communication in this course (see syllabus for sign up link). For your
    project you will need to create the following on Ryver:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A public forum and submit the channel name on the course web site under your project details. This forum
        will be the primary means for anyone outside the team who wants to you about your project. (Verify that the link
        displays on your project page and that it is accurate)
    </li>
    <li>
        A private team on Ryver and invite Jesse into your team. This team will be used to privately discuss any
        grading decisions or other sensitive information with your group.
    </li>
</ul>


== Repository

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Create a GitHub repository for your project.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: A GitHub symbol will appear on your project page which links to your repository
</div>

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Add the course webhook to your repository and create an issue in GitHub.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The issue will appear on your project page
</div>

<p>
    Create a public repository on GitHub and submit the link in your project details. In addition, setup the course web
    hook to send JSON for all
    events and be sure that all team members add their GitHub id to their user profile on the course web site.
</p>

<p>
    Webhook url: https://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/webhook
</p>

<img src="/static/webhook_image.png" class="img-responsive"/>

<!--<p>-->
<!--If your project appears on the project page with a link to your repo then you did it right.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Once the webhook is setup, create your first issue in GitHub. This issue can be anything, but you should verify that
    it appears on your project page. If it does not, re-check your webhook setup to find the error.
</p>

== Team Contract

<div class="requirement alert alert-danger">
    <b>Requirement</b>: Sign and submit a team contract.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Physically hand the signed contract to Jesse. The course staff will verify that all the required
    content is in the contract and that it is signed by all team members
</div>

<!--(Which tech, frameworks, how will they be combined, potential pitfalls and adjustments)-->
<p>
    <em>
        Deliver a document outlining your project and the roles of each team member.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The team contract must be printed and signed by all team members, then submitted to the course instructor by the end
    of week 2. This contract will be kept on file and will be used throughout the semester. You are bound to this
    contract and its contents will be used to determine grading decisions. Any violations of this contract by a team
    member may result in a grade reduction for that person. If your group wishes to change your contract you can submit
    a replacement as long as all team members agree to
    and sign the new contract. These changes must be made in-between project submissions (ie. You can't redefine your
    MVP the day before the MVP deadline).
</p>

<hr/>
<p>
    Your team contract must containing the following sections and details:
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Project Outline
</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Look through the criteria for all 7 project submissions before finalizing your
    contract.
</div>

<p>
    Provide a high-level outline of your project and the technologies involved. This should give a clear idea of your
    vision for the project and a general idea of how that vision will become a reality.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the ideas and technologies, this section must clearly define your Minimum Viable Product
    (MVP) and at least 3 potential add-on features that can be added to this MVP. By th end of the semester
    you will be required to complete and deploy your MVP and at least one of these add-on features. Since only one
    add-on features needs to be completed, do not hesitate to list difficult features. All the features combined should
    show the true potential that your project could become.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>MVP</strong>: As the name implies, when choosing your MVP you should choose the minimal amount of
    functionality needed to deliver
    a viable product. Think about the absolute minimal feature set that can still be useful to the end user and choose
    that. Anything that isn't absolutely necessary should be used as an add-on feature.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Add-on Feature</strong>: These are additional features that your project can benefit from having. These
    features must enable the end user to accomplish something that they could not do without it (ie. stylistic or
    performance changes
    will not count as add-on features in this course. They must add functionality for the end user to your software).
</p>

<!--Create-->
<!--issues/milestones/tags in GitHub for everything in this document. A feature may-->
<!--be divided into multiple issues.-->


<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: If your idea is very ambitious, don't put the whole project in your MVP. Identify a
    simple core in the
    project and make that your MVP with everything else as add-on features. You must complete and release your MVP and
    at least 1
    add-on feature this semester so don't commit to more work than your team can handle. Work on more add-on features to
    complete the full vision if you have time.
</div>

<!--<br/>-->
<!--<h4>-->
<!--Meetings-->
<!--</h4>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Protocols for meetings. All group member must meet at least once a week. Can have multiple meeting to get full-->
<!--coverage if needed. Use the site to schedule these meetings. Official meetings must be held in Baldy 19.-->
<!--</p>-->


<br/>
<h4>
    Team Roles
</h4>

<p>
    With the project defined you will now divide the work of the project among you team members. It is highly
    recommended that you take your time on this section and ensure that everyone is satisfied with their roles. If this
    section is lacking it may have severe stress later in the semester.
</p>

<p>
    Each member of the team must have at least 1 role on the project for which they will responsible. Likewise, every
    aspect of the project should have
    a team member assigned to it. Any task that does not clearly belong a team member is a potential source of
    controversy. You are free to decide these roles, though keep in mind that these roles will be used to make grading
    decisions. If one of your project submissions is unacceptable, an attempt will be made to identify which area of the
    project is lacking. If it is only broken because of one area, only team member responsible for that area will
    receive a grade reduction. If the responsible member(s) cannot easily be determined based on these roles, the entire
    group will receive the grade reduction. For this reason it is recommended that the roles correspond aspects visible
    in the final software, are mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive. It may be impossible to achieve all of
    these, but the roles should be defined as clearly as possible nonetheless.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: If your group is struggling to define these roles you can try the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This provides 3 clear(ish) areas that can be assigned, or sub-divided.
</div>

<p>
    Note that all team members might not have equal work to do for each submission, but you should try to balance the
    amount of work done by each member throughout the whole semester.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to every aspect of the project having a group member assigned to complete it, each aspect must have an
    assigned reviewer in the group (not the assigned member) who will review any code submitted in that area. Every
    member of the group must be a reviewer for at least one part of the project. You are
    free to assign these
    reviewers however you'd like. The
    reviewer will perform the code reviews for any code submitted to this area and maintain the integrity of the
    project.
    If the reviewer approves broken or buggy
    code, they are responsible and may be held accountable in the form of a grade reduction.
</p>

<!--<div class="alert alert-info">-->
<!--<strong>Recommended</strong>: You have a lot of freedom in this section and you should use this freedom wisely. From-->
<!--a grading perspective, every piece of code submitted to your project must have 1 member assigned to it and another-->
<!--member reviewing it. If any code is broken in a project submission, these two members will be in question.-->
<!--</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Each area of the project needs an assignee, and at least 1 reviewer. The assignee is doing the work and the-->
<!--reviewers must-->
<!--approve any pull request to develop. If things break, both are blamed (demerit). If the code sucks it's-->
<!--the assignees fault, if it sucks and the pull request is approved it's also the reviewers fault. (My response when a-->
<!--reviewer gets dinged? Where are your tests? Did you make sure the worker was testing? Why didn't you test?) Reviewer-->
<!--should checkout the pull request and verify that it's in working condition. Pull request must be made with enough-->
<!--time for review, and possibly multiple rounds of review. First week of a sprint for coding, second-->
<!--week for review? Up to the group. Put your requirements in this document. Violate the document and you'll face a-->
<!--grade reduction (In certain cases the whole group can decide that something was an acceptable violation).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Assign everything to at least one group member. This includes video submissions and documentation. If something is-->
<!--missing or crappy,-->
<!--the assigned member will take a hit. Try to balance all the work for each member. Note that not all members will do-->
<!--equal work for each submission, but it should be close to equal throughout the whole semester. There might be some-->
<!--negotiation here. [Can have a designated tester(s), though you can't blame them when your code sucks. Maybe they're-->
<!--only blamed if they didn't open a bug ticket before the deadline]-->
<!--</p>-->

<br/>
<h4>
    Dispute resolution
</h4>
<p>
    This section will detail the team's dispute resolution solution.
    <!--Disputes are bound to occur-->
    <!--in any team. -->
    Team members might argue over frameworks, languages, who's responsible for a specific task, or even
    whether to use tabs or spaces.
    Anything that is not clearly defined in this document has the potential to become a
    dispute. You won't be able to predict what will cause a conflict later in the semester and add them all to the
    contract, but
    you must outline a protocol that you will follow if a dispute does occur. This can be something ridiculous, fun,
    serious, or whatever, but it must give a clear resolution. All members agree that this is the method that will be
    used and will
    be bound to the results. This will
    help the team move forward when a deadlock is reached and neither side is willing to move off their positions.
</p>

<p>
    Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bring in a mediator (please define who will be the mediator)
    </li>
    <li>
        Compete in a game (winner gets to make the decision)
    </li>
    <li>
        Rock-paper-scissors or flip a coin (if you want random 50/50 decisions)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Whatever your team decides, it is recommended that you have fun with this section. You will be enforcing this
    protocol at times of high stress when you will likely need some light-hearted fun.
</p>


<br/>
<h4>
    Additional Details
</h4>
<p>
    The above are the minimum requirements for this document. Add any other details that you'd like in this document.
    If the document is vague and unclear, only the course structure will be used and any decisions will be made at the
    instructor's discretion.
</p>

<p>
    With the wide variety of projects and teams the course structure has to be somewhat vague. This is your opportunity
    to add structure that is specific to you, your team, and your project. Within reason, this contract will be used to
    make
    grading decisions where the course leaves areas undefined. For example, the course gives -1 to all team members if
    a video submission is missing or doesn't meet the criteria for its submission, but if you state in this contract
    that a specific team member is responsible for video submissions then only that team member will receive a grade
    reduction. Use this to your advantage to agree on and clearly specify exactly what each group member should
    contribute to the project this semester (This should be sounding redundant by now).
</p>

<p>
    Some examples of recommended additions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specify a deadline for code submissions. The vanilla course allows students to submit a pull request right
        at a deadline. This puts the code reviewer in a very tough spot where they either have to trust the author and
        accept the code without review (risking their own grade) or refuse the request and potentially enter a dispute.
        This can be avoided by requiring pull requests to be submitted with ample time for review.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign the video, documentation, and other miscellaneous tasks to specific team members. If each team member's
        role is very clearly defined it will limit disputes and stress later in the semester.
    </li>
</ul>


<!--== Tasks-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Make sure everyone knows what to do for the prototype (assign tasks based on areas). Assign these tasks in GitHub.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Only 1 repo. If you're planning android/iOS/web, choose 1 as your course project and plan the others later or as-->
<!--add-ons. If you have an API backend it must be in the same repo as your client.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<p>-->
<!--Each member must be assigned an "area" of the project. Try your best to clearly define these areas and divide the-->
<!--work evenly across them. Every area must contribute significantly to the MVP. No one can have an add-on feature as-->
<!--an area. Be aware of how the work of an area is dived between the MVP and add-on features. Does someone have an area-->
<!--that doesn't need work after the MVP? Are you comfortable with that group member not doing much work after the MVP-->
<!--is released?-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Define as clearly as you can the boundaries between areas. Define the interfaces between them and code to the-->
<!--interfaces! This will save headaches while merging. This will make testing easier. This will make bugs easier to-->
<!--detect and fix. It allows team mates to work in parallel. Do this! At a loss for ideas? Start with MVC.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--We wont always check each individual contribution to the project, but if an area of the project is not working (and-->
<!--the rest is) then we know who is responsible. Set up the splits so a single team mate can't drag down the group.-->
<!--Ideally, a group member doesn't do their work.. don't stress, just get your stuff done and it will be clear who-->
<!--didn't work because their area will suck.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Groups can nominate an area as difficult. The member assigned to that area can get a gold star if everything is-->
<!--completed on time. 1 free, additional with approval. Caution for taking a very difficult project. This is a gamble.-->
<!--I need an A so I'm taking a difficult one. You're cool with a B? Take this easy area.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Project Setup Checklist-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;(Repo, Ryver, tasks, member assignments, team contract, web hook)&ndash;&gt;-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--To complete this stage of the project you must complete all of the following steps that have been detailed above.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<ol>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--Formation: Form or join a team and setup the project on the course website-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--Ryver: Create a public forum and private team for your project. Add the public forum link to your project-->
<!--details and add Jesse to the private team.-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--Repository: Create a repository for your project on GitHub, add the link to your project details on the-->
<!--course website, and setup the course web hook on your repository-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--<li>-->
<!--Team Contract: Create, sign, and submit a team contract with all the required information-->
<!--</li>-->
<!--</ol>-->


== Grading

<!--<div class="gold-star">+1 Do really well!</div>-->

<!--<div class="decent">0 Meet the requirements</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit">-1 Do a terrible job</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit"><strong>-1</strong> | One or more of the project setup steps are incomplete</div>-->

<!--<div class="demerit"><strong>-1</strong> | Did not choose a project and form/join a team</div>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Note that these points can stack. If you are not on a team by the deadline you implicitly have not completed all the-->
<!--steps to setup a project and will receive -2 on your course grade.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Grading adjustments can apply to the whole team or to an individual student.
