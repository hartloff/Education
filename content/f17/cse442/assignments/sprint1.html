== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Form a team</li>
    <li>Choose a project</li>
    <li>Setup project structure (Repo, Ryver, tasks, member assignments, team contract)</li>
    <li>Design document (Which tech, frameworks, how will they be combined, potential pitfalls and adjustments)</li>
</ul>

== Repo

<p>
    Create a repo and submit the link here.
</p>

== Design Document

<p>
    Outline of your project and the technology involved. This should give a clear idea of your vision for the project.
    Outline your core feature, MVP, add-on features. Create issues in github for everything in this document. A feature
    may be divided into multiple issues.
</p>

<p>
    Each area of the project needs an assignee, and 2 reviewers. The assignee is doing the work and the reviewers must
    approve any pull request to develop. If things break, all three are blamed (demerit).
</p>

<!--== Group Points-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--All points for this sprint are graded on a group basis. All group member will share the same grade for sprint 1.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--= Repository (1 point)-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Create a repository for the group project on GitHub and add a README with a-->
<!--description of the project.-->
<!--{#    Track chosen. WebHook added to repo (Iâ€™ll scrape all repos and use the README in the project page)#}-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--{#<p>#}-->
<!--{#    If your project appears on the project page with a link to your repo then you did it right.#}-->
<!--{#</p>#}-->

<!--= Meetings and Minutes (1 point)-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Minutes for all meetings are pushed to the group repository. A template will be-->
<!--provided to define the format that the minutes must follow as well as their location in the repo.-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--{#= Version Control (1 point)#}-->
<!--{#<p>#}-->
<!--{#    Group Version Control (Master and Develop. Must be called these and repo will be scraped to check. Possibly have a#}-->
<!--{#    variable in the submission file where they can use different names?)#}-->
<!--{#</p>#}-->


<!--{#= Group Project Management (1 point)#}-->
<!--{##}-->
<!--{#<p>#}-->
<!--{#    Prepare for sprint 2 by assigning tasks to each member. Tasks tracked in GitHub#}-->
<!--{#</p>#}-->

<!--= Prototype (1 point)-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Deliver a working prototype of your project. This prototype must be merged into the master branch in the repo and be-->
<!--tagged as release "v0.1.0" in GitHub. This prototype does not have to have any functionality, but should give the end user-->
<!--an idea of what the finished software might look like. For example, the prototype can be a GUI with all the proper-->
<!--layout, but the buttons don't have any functionality when clicked. The nature of the prototype will vary by project.-->
<!--Get creative with how you show the users your vision.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--= YouTube Video (1 point)-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Upload a demo of your prototype to YouTube. This video must give an accurate view of the current state of your-->
<!--project and show the running prototype. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience to give them an-->
<!--idea of what you are going to accomplish this semester. You should not be scrolling through code in this video.-->
<!--</p>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--This video must be shorter than 2 minutes to get credit. This will be strictly enforced. The goal is-->
<!--to quickly communicate the status of your project to the end users.-->
<!--</p>-->
