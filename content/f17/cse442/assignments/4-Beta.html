== Beta Release

<p>
    <em>
        Release your software for beta testers.
    </em>
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Someone with no programming experience must be able to access and use your software for
    its intended purpose and provide feedback to your team.
</div>
<!--<p>-->
<!--The beta version of your project must be available to the public (At least to UB students).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--If special hardware is required, setup times when you can demo your project.-->
<!--</p>-->
<p>
    Features should freeze for this sprint, unless the team is behind. You are still delivering the MVP feature set, and
    you are deploying it to be used by a non-technical user base. You cannot expect your users to clone your repo or
    compile any code from source. For example, if you are deploying a desktop or mobile app you can offer a downloadable
    executable
    in some form (this can be hosted in an app store). If you
    deploy a web app you can provide a link to your deployed app. The specifics may vary depending on your project, but
    you must fit the criteria of making your software available for use to a non-technical audience. If you have any
    questions about deploying your software please contact the course staff immediately.
    <!--Apply polish, test, test, fix bugs, more-->
    <!--testing, write documentation. Procedure for bug fixes will be enforced. All bug must be tracked.-->
</p>

<p>
    The beta version of your project must be merged into your master branch and be tagged as release "v0.3.0" on GitHub.
</p>

== Landing Page

<p>
    Your beta release must be accompanied by a landing page for your project that includes instructions relevant to beta
    testers. This is the site you would/will share with
    anyone interested in the project and can be thought of as a poster advertising the project. You can include any
    additional information you'd like to this page (more information will be required for your final release), but for
    the beta release you are only required to have the following:
    <!--It is up to your team-->
    <!--what to put on this site (suggestions include listing team-->
    <!--members, link to the repository, description of the project, etc).-->
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Describe how a non-technical user can access your deployment
    </li>
    <li>
        How beta testers send feedback (not bugs) to the team
    </li>
    <li>
        The method for reporting bugs to the team. Bugs must be reported through GitHub issues on your project's
        repository. Your team can add any additional steps you'd like your beta testers to follow.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You should also add any additional information that is specific to your team such as specific bugs to look for,
    which features to test,
    special testing credential, etc. The more information you provide to your testers and the more specific questions
    you ask them, the more likely you are to receive meaningful feedback.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Create a Google form with specific questions for testers to answer after testing.
</div>

<p>
    Add the link to your project details on the
    course website and verify that it appears on your project page.
</p>

<!--== Beta Tester Documentation-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Provide documentation to beta testers about how to test your software. Where the readme is intended for technical-->
<!--users working with your source code, this documentation need to describe how non-technical users can access your-->
<!--deployment.-->

<!--Test doc describes additional info needed for-->
<!--testers (how to provide feedback, how to report a bug in github issues and which tags to use, specific bugs to look-->
<!--for, special login credentials that open up debug options, etc). It's up to your team to decide how to setup this-->
<!--documentation so long as it provides clear instructions and direction for beta testers.-->
<!--</p>-->

== Testing

<p>
    There are no new features added for your beta release so you have 2 weeks to test you code an ensure proper
    functionality. Although your testing, or lack thereof, will not affect your grade directly you will be held
    accountable for any major bugs or errors that appear in your released code. For your beta release there may be many
    minor bug reports (this is the purpose of beta testing), but you should not release your beta version with any known
    bugs or broken features. The bugs reported should be such that they would have been very difficult to find in
    development.
    <!--It is highly recommended that your team agrees on a robust testing-->
    <!--methodology so you can release your software with confidence. In addition, robust testing will also make code-->
    <!--reviews much simpler for the team.-->
</p>

== Bug Fix

<p>
    If and when a bug is found it must be tracked using GitHub issues. When a pull request is submitted you must
    reference the issue for the bug and close the issue once the request is approved. Be sure to use labels to mark this
    as a bug fix.
</p>

== YouTube Video

<p>
    Complete a video demo of your beta release and upload it to YouTube. This video must
    show a working demo of all features in your MVP as described in your team contract, but updated with any changes
    made since the previous release.
    As with the previous 2 videos, this video will be directed
    towards a non-technical audience and you should not show any code or use any technical
    language in this video. However, this video will likely be used as reference for your beta testers so you should
    be sure to explain anything that will relevant specifically to them. You are not only showing your functionality in
    this video, you are preparing users to use your deployed beta release.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes. The goal is
    to show the end users how the software is supposed to be used.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Submission
</h4>

<p>
    Once complete, submit the link to your beta release video here. After submitting, check your project page to verify
    that the video is displayed properly.
</p>

<form action="/courses/cse442-f17/submit-video/beta" method="post">
    <div>
        <label>Video Link:</label>
        <input type="text" name="link"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
    </div>
</form>


<!--== Deployment-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--The beta version of your project must be available to the public (At least to UB students).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--If special hardware is required, setup times when you can demo your project.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Recommended (If deploying networked app): Digital Ocean.. is it fair to recommend a paid product? Heroku (free). AWS-->
<!--</p>-->


== On-Boarding

<p>
    During the next phase of the project you will be completing a task for another team in the course, and your class
    mates will completing tasks for your team. To facilitate this you must prepare your project for the on-boarding
    process and make it possible, or even simple, for a developer to visit your project and contribute code. At the end
    of the next phase you will be assessed based on how difficult or easy it was for someone to contribute to your
    project. As with many aspects of this course, submitting quality work in this section will save you time, and
    possibly your grade, later in the course.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
    Use your GitHub wiki to outline your project and provide everything needed for a new developer to join the team. An
    outside developer who is unfamiliar with the project should be able to contribute code to your project after reading
    the wiki without
    having to contact the team (Though they can, and should, contact the team via your Ryver channel, having a
    face-to-face meeting with them might be too
    difficult to schedule so the wiki should leave them with only quick questions, if any). The wiki should also include
    contribution instructions (how to create a pull request, which branches to use, which tags to use in issues, who to
    assign as a code reviewer, etc).
</p>

<p>
    Your code itself should also be easy to follow and well-organized. Simplicity is critical here. Meaningful naming,
    comments where needed, intuitive directory structure, etc. Try to imagine looking at your repository for the first
    time. Does it make sense? Is it confusing? Are there things that would need explaining? If so, adjust as needed.
</p>


<br/>
<h4>Tasks</h4>

<p>
    Prepare your outside tasks to be completed by students outside your group during the next submission cycle. These
    tasks do not have to substantial, but they must have an impact on your final product (ie. adding comments is not
    acceptable). These tasks must be tagged with "outside-help" in GitHub issues.
</p>

<p>
    Each team member must create at least 2 tasks for outside that fall under their area of the project as defined by
    the team contract.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Assigning outside tasks for an add-on feature can reduce your workload for the next
    submission
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Recommended</strong>: Write tests for the tasks that will be completed by outside help to make it absolutely
    clear what needs to be done.
</div>
