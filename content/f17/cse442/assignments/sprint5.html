== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Share your project with the world for all to enjoy!</li>
</ul>

== Overview

<p>
    You've put in 12 weeks of hard work to complete a great project. Now it's time to share your work with the world!
</p>

== Group Points

<p>
    All point for this sprint are graded on a group basis. All group members will share the same grade.
</p>

= Project Completion (4 Points)

<p>
    The project is stable and ready for release. There must not be any major bugs and the software is usable for its
    intended purpose.
</p>
<p>
    If previous sprints went well, these points will be automatic. If there were significant issues throughout the
    previous sprints that have not been rectified then these points will not be awarded.
</p>

= Documentation (4 Points)

<p>
    The project is appropriately documented with enough detail for a user to understand how to use your software with no
    information other than documentation. The type and extent of documentation required will vary greatly between
    projects. Requirements for each group will be discussed during the group meetings with the course staff. It is
    recommended that you start writing documentation early and check with the course staff if the documentation is
    appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    For open-source projects, the documentation should be contained in the repo's README file and wiki pages.
</p>
<p>
    Partial credit may be awarded at the discretion of the course staff.
</p>

= Deployment (4 Points)

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Someone with no programming experience must be able to access and use your software for
    its intended purpose.
</div>

<p>
    The finished software has been deployed and publicly available on the Internet. Exact details for deployment will
    vary between projects. Specific
    deployment strategies for
    each group will be discussed during the group meetings with the course staff.
</p>

<p>
    Deployment strategies will fall into one of two
    main categories, monetized and open-source. If you choose to monetize, deployment will require that interested
    investors
    and/or customers have a way to give you money for your project. If your group chooses not to monetize, the project
    must be open-source and available on GitHub in
    addition to deploying the finished software for anyone to use.
</p>


<p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Release your software for sale on a publicly available platform (ex. Steam)</li>
    <li>Start a crowd funding campaign (ex. KickStarter)</li>
    <li>Deliver a VC pitch to potential investors</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses <b>not</b> to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Host your software for free on a publicly available platform (ex. Kongregate)</li>
    <li>Host your software as a stand-alone web app</li>
    <li>Submit a research paper based on results produced by your software to a research conference or
        journal
    </li>
    <li>Host binaries for simple installation on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu. Having users install from your source code is
        not acceptable.
    </li>
</ul>


= Release Video (4 Points)
<p>
    Upload a video about your software. There is no time criteria for this video. There are no requirements for what
    needs to be contained in this video. As long as a video is uploaded, these 4 points will awarded to the group.
</p>

<p>
    You are encouraged to put time and thought into how you present this version of your software to the world. This
    video is a representation of your group and the work you have completed this semester. It can be a powerful tool
    while
    networking and searching for jobs to show other what you're capable of accomplishing as part of a team (which is
    what companies want to hire you to do). The grading criteria will step out of the way here so you can choose how you
    want to
    present your work, and yourselves, to others in the technical industry.
