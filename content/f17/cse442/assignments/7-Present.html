== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Maintain your deployed software</li>
    <li>Address any bug reports</li>
    <li>Present your project</li>
</ul>


== Maintenance

<div class="requirement alert alert-success">
    <b>Practical Objective</b>: No bug reports. Responsive to communication through GitHub and Ryver.<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: Course staff will verify that no bug reports have been made. Note that they will use discretion to
    determine if a report is an actual bug (example: a user filing a bug report that they prefer a green background is
    not an actual bug). They will also verify that the team is responsive to new issues, pull requests, messages on the
    team's public Ryver forum, or any other reasonable method of contact.<br/>
    <b>Note</b>: There are 2 practicals objectives for this phase. Both must be met to earn a +1.
</div>

<p>
    Your deployed software must be available to users throughout this entire three week period. Users will expect your
    MVP and at least 1 add-on feature to be available and these features must work correctly for their intended purpose.
    Any issues with you software may be reported on GitHub issues and you must be responsive
    to any such issues. Users may be actively trying to break your software so watch for
    bug reports. Unlike the beta version, your released software is expected to be robust and bug free. If a bug does
    arise the team must be responsive in addressing the issue that release an update if needed.
</p>

<!--Note that maintenance will be quite different depending on the type of app. For example, maintaining a web app has -->
<!--different challenges than does a desktop app.-->

== Presentation

<div class="requirement alert alert-success">
    <b>Practical Objective</b>: Presentation is amazing!<br/>
    <b>Verify</b>: The audience should be blown away.<br/>
    <b>Note</b>: Feedback from students may be used as evidence for grading decisions, but will not directly affect
    any grading decision.
</div>


<!--<p>-->
<!--Not just your presentation in class, but the entire presentation of your project. Is all the documentation existent-->
<!--and clear? Does the program run smooth and bug free? Is it intuitive to use?-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--In class presentation: Any missing team member takes a grade reduction. Technical issues are unacceptable. Tripping-->
<!--over each-->
<!--other and talking over each other is unacceptable (like, really?.. I sucks that I even have to say these things).-->
<!--Come prepared. Rehearse. Test the technology of the room BEFORE your presentation FFS.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Your team must schedule a time to present your final project and present. All team members must attend the
    presentation. The presentation will be assessed using the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A self-contained description of the project must be presented. Anyone in the audience with no prior knowledge
        about your work should get a clear idea of what your software does and what it accomplishes through the
        presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must show a live working demo of your software
    </li>
    <li>
        The technologies use to implement your project must be covered. Unlike the YouTube videos, you will get
        technical in your presentations. This does not have to be detailed, but it should give the audience an idea of
        how your project was implemented. For example, describe which languages, libraries, services, and frameworks you
        used and how they interact.
    </li>
    <li>
        The presentation must be executed professionally. There is no need to dress up, but you should be organized and
        well prepared before presenting. You should not be struggling with the projector, talking over your team
        members, figuring out what to say, debugging your demo, going over your scheduled time, etc during your
        presentation. Be prepared.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>
    Only group members in attendance for the presentation will receive the points above. If a group member is unable to
    attend the groups presentation time please notify the course staff at least 24 hours <b>before</b> the presentation.
    Excuses given later will not be entertained unless there was a documented emergency.
</p>

<p>
    Note: As the lecture activities during this phase all students will be asked to rate the presentation.
