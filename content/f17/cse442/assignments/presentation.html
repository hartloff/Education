== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Give a presentation of your project to the class and course staff</li>
    <li>Get technical</li>
</ul>

== Presentation (1 Point)

<p>
    Give a presentation of your project to the class. Time constraints may be added due to logistics, but they will not
    be related to grading.
</p>

<p>
    All group members must be present, but not all group members need to talk during the presentation. Absent group
    members will receive no points.
</p>

== Descriptive (1 Point)

<p>
    A self-contained description of the project is presented. Anyone in the audience with no prior knowledge about you work
    should get a clear idea of what your software does and what it accomplishes through the presentation.
</p>

== Demo (1 Point)

<p>
    The presentation contains a working demo of the completed software.
</p>

<p>
    In certain cases where the project cannot be shown
    during the presentation the demo may be prerecorded (ex. A control system for a self-driving boat).
</p>

== Technical Details (1 point)

<p>
    The presentation contains an overview of the technology used to complete the project. The details don't have to be
    comprehensive, but should give your technical audience a good idea of how the project functions.
</p>

== Attendance

<p>
    Only group members in attendance for the presentation will receive the points above. If a group member is unable to
    attend the groups presentation time please notify the course staff at least 24 hours <b>before</b> the presentation.
    Excuses given later will not be entertained unless there was a documented emergency.
</p>

== Complete Project

<p>
    No points will be awarded if the project is incomplete. In certain cases a project can be presented without all of
    the proposed features being complete, but the software must be usable.
