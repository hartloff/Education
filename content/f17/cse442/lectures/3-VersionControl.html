== Procedure

<ul>
    <li>Create an issue in GitHub for your task</li>
    <li>Create a feature branch off of develop for that issue</li>
    <li>When complete, create a pull request to merge the feature branch into develop</li>
    <li>Reviewer approves (or rejects) pull request</li>
    <li>Once all reviewers approve, merge the code into the develop branch</li>
</ul>

<h4>Create an Issue</h4>

<p>
    If hasn't already been added, create an issue in GitHub for the task you are going to complete. The issue must
    include a descriptive title of the task to be completed and additional details in the description if necessary. You
    can also add appropriate tags and milestones to help your team organize the tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Note that GitHub issues can be created by anyone, not just collaborators on your project. During beta testing and
    after the official release you may have people submitting bug reports and feature requests. If the issue they create
    isn't clear, you should comment on it to start a conversation with the submitter.
</p>

<p>
    Once the issue has been added with all the relevant information, set yourself as the assignee of the task.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Create and Work on a Feature Branch</h4>

<p>
    Once you have a task in GitHub assigned to you and you're ready to start coding, then next step is to create a
    feature branch for the task. With the exception of hot fixes, this branch will be created off of the develop branch.
    This is the only branch to which you will push code while working on this task.
</p>

<p>
    Recommended: While developing on a feature branch, you can merge from develop and other feature branches into your
    feature branch to catch integration issues early in the process.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Create a Pull Request</h4>

<p>
    Once you complete you task and have tested to verify that your code is working properly, you are ready to merge your
    code into develop. This must be done through a pull request with a code review. When you create a pull request to
    merge your code you must reference the issue number that is being completed in the description of the request and add
    the appropriate team member (According to your team contract) as a reviewer on the request.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Code Review</h4>

<p>
    Code reviews are a two-way process and communication between the reviewer and the contributor is critically
    important.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Reviewer</b>: Ensure that the code in the request completes the issue associated with it and that the code is
    of high enough quality to meet the teams standards. To test the code, the reviewer should
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/">check out</a> the pull request code
    and run all appropriate tests in their development environment. If there are any problems, the code is of low
    quality, or doesn't comply with the teams style conventions, the reviewer should comment on the pull request to let
    the requester know that they need to revise their code and update the request. Once the code is satisfactory, the
    request can be approved.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Contributor</b>: The contributor is responsible for responding to any comments made on their pull request and
    address any concerns that have been raised. If the code needs revision, make the changes and update the pull
    request. Keep in mind that this can be a frustrating process as other people raise concerns about your code. Keep
    calm during this process and understand that everyone is working together to develop the best possible project.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Merge into Develop</h4>

<p>
    Once the pull request is approved, the code is ready to be merged into develop. At this point, any team member can
    perform the merge and close the issue in GitHub. At this point the code is officially part of the project.
