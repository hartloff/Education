== Testing

<p>
    Covered in CSE116. You should have been testing in all your courses. There's no autograder here to tell you if
    you're right or wrong. It's up to you to test and decide when the code is finished.

-Let 442 know that bad bug reports are part of the job. Even your bosses might not know what they're doing. YOU are the domain expert and you cannot expect others to have any competency in your area. Would you want HR expecting you to know all about HR?
