== CSE442

<p>
    You can write code by yourself. Now develop software as a team.
</p>

<!--<p>-->
<!--What is an MVP anyway? What's an add-on feature? User stories basically.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Weekly meetings.-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Form your groups early. The team contract will take a while. If you rush the contract you might pay for it as early
    as the prototype submission.
</p>

<!--<p>-->
    <!--Meetings-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--This course is all about teamwork. Choose your teammates carefully. Choose your project carefully. You will be stuck-->
<!--with both for the whole semester.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Emphasis on self-learning. This may be uncomfortable for some of you, but it is necessary. We can't teach you-->
<!--everything in 4 years. CSE is an enormous and growing field. After graduation it is your responsibility to keep up.-->
<!--Every team will do things a little different. I want you to understand the underlying difficulties of collaborating-->
<!--to write software.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--I won't force you to test, but I will penalize you for releasing software with bugs.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Attention to detail will be important throughout hte course. It is easy to miss a deadline and hurt your grade or-->
<!--miss a criteria for a submission.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Grading-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Everyone starts with a B. Most things you do in this course will not affect your grade (hopefully). Do something-->
<!--unacceptable, or don't do something at all, or turn something in late and your grade goes down. Do something-->
<!--exceptional and your grade goes up. Do everything you're supposed to do without being amazing and you'll end with a-->
<!--B. However, you must really earn an A.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--In short, if you are trying to do the bare minimum required to get an A, you will earn a B. If you have to ask what-->
<!--it takes to get an A, you're probably not doing enough.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Entrepreneur Track-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Somewhat different course. No requirement to have other work on your projects, but you still need to work on others.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Must deliver a full business plan.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Must be prepared to present to investors. Even if you don't want to take on an investor, the presentation must feel-->
<!--like a VC pitch (think shark tank).-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--If in 4 months you are not on your way to becoming a business owner, you will fail.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--I'll sign an NDA if you'd prefer.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--Note that you can still monetize your project without choosing this track. Just because your code is public doesn't-->
<!--mean it's open-source. You still own the copyright to your code unless you explicitly give it away with an-->
<!--open-source licence.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--== Sponsored Projects-->

<!--<p>-->
<!--There are a few real-world project available. If you take one of these project we will work with the client and-->
<!--make adjustments ot the course criteria as needed.-->
