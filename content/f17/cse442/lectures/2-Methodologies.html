== Software

<p>
    There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no
    deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. - C A R Hoare

== Waterfall


== Agile

== MVC

<p>
    Not a methodology, but a design pattern. Might need a design patterns page. Added here so I don't forget and this
    would be very useful when they are dividing the project between members. More than 3 members? Decide which area has
    the most work and divide that. Web app? Probably controller (one person could handle authentication, another to
    setup all the routing). Desktop app? Probably model.
