== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Give a presentation of your project to the class and course staff</li>
    <li>Get technical!</li>
</ul>

== Presentation (1 Point)

<p>
    Give a presentation of your project to the class. Unless specified elsewhere there is no limit or requirement on the
    amount time for the presentation. Points will be awarded based on this rubric which does not include the amount of
    time spent presenting. Time constraints may be added due to logistics, but they will not be related to grading.
</p>

<p>
    All group members must be present, but not all group members need to talk during the presentation.
</p>

== Descriptive (1 Point)

<p>
    A self-contained description of the project is presented. Anyone in the audience who doesn't know about your project
    should get a clear idea of what your software does and what it accomplishes.
</p>

== Demo (1 Point)

<p>
    The presentation contains a demo of the completed software.
</p>

<p>
    In certain cases where the project cannot be shown
    during the presentation the demo may be prerecorded (ex. A control system for a self-driving boat).
</p>

== Technical Details (1 point)

<p>
    The presentation contains an overview of the technology used to complete the project. The details don't have to be
    comprehensive (unless you want to present for hours/days) but should give your technical audience a good idea of how
    the project works.
</p>

== Attendance

<p>
    Only group members in attendance for the presentation will receive the points above. If a group member is unable to
    attend the groups presentation time please notify the course staff at least 24 hours <b>before</b> the presentation.
    Excuses given later will not be entertained.
</p>

== Complete Project

<p>
    No points will be awarded if the project is incomplete. In certain cases a project can be presented without all of
    the proposed features being complete, but the software must be usable.
