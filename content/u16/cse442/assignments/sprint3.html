== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Implement the majority of the functionality for your project</li>
    <li>Show performance on an individual basis</li>
</ul>

== Individual Performance

<p>
    All points for this sprint will be awarded on an individual basis. By this time in the project there should be a
    clear division of tasks. Individual effort will be observed for the following 4 points.
</p>

== Individual Version Control and Project Management (1 Point)

<p>
    Proper use of version control with professionalism. A meaningful branching model is being used. Commit messages
    generally make sense. Tasks are assigned to the group member and are clearly tracked.
</p>

<p>
    This point will not be awarded if there hasn't been progress made on the tasks assigned to the
    individual.
</p>

== Communication with the Group (1 Point)

<p>
    Individual is attending group meetings and interacting with the group. The group should be aware of the progress
    being made by the individual and which tasks they are working on. Missing meeting and not keeping the group informed
    of your work is a sure way to not earn this point.
</p>

<p>
    This point will not be awarded if there hasn't been progress made on the tasks assigned to the
    individual.
</p>

== Individual Task Completion (2 point)

<p>
    Complete assigned tasks and merge them into the master branch for the release associated with this sprint. Your work
    should be apparent in the delivered software for the sprint.
