== Motivation

We can skip blocks of code, what if we want to repeat a block.

== While Loops

While

Requires a boolean expression. When it's false, stop the loop.

Similar to an if statement, but keeps executing until the condition is false.

Condition is checked before each iteration. If the condition is false when the loop is first reached it will never execute.

Guessing game. Track number of guesses. While the user hasn't guessed correctly, ask for another guess.
Print number of guesses and correct answer. [Need user input]

Use examples that motivate the syntax of for loops.


== For Loops

For

3 optional expressions.

Syntactical sugar.

Simple format for a very common loop setup.

== Continue and Break

When you want to make an exception.
