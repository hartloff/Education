<h4>
    Sally is a college freshman adjusting to her new environment. Sally enjoys eating at restaurants
    with her friends, hanging out over a few drinks (juice of course), and getting plenty of sleep. To pay for this,
    Sally works
    part-time as a server, but she's not sure if there's enough time to live this same
    lifestyle in college. Between classes, sleep, and relaxing, will she be able to work enough hours to pay for her
    food and drink each week? Or will Sally have homemade rice and water every day?
</h4>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<h4>
    Sally plans to enjoy more than just the next 4 years and will learn how to
    start a career that will fund a more luxurious lifestyle after graduation. During orientation she heard
    the recommended time she should spend on her courses and she plans to budget this much time for her studies.
</h4>

<h4>
    Sally is determined to balance all aspects of her life and make the next 4 years as enjoyable as possible without
    sacrificing her future. With only 24 hours each day, she's not sure if she'll have enough time to do everything.
</h4>


<h4>
    Your task is to write a program where Sally can test different lifestyle choices and determine how well she can live
    during her college years which achieving her short-term and long-term goals.

== Problem Definitions

<p>
    Specific details on what needs to be completed for the assignment are provided as comments in the handout code:
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-s17/assessments/homework1eatsleepdrink">Autolab</a>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/hartloff/EatSleepDrink.git">Repository</a>
</p>


== Testing

<p>
    You are strongly encouraged to use the main method to test your code. Below is an example for testing the
    maximumCredits method. Autolab will provide 1 test case and expected result for each incorrect question. To help
    you arrive at the correct solution, you should add this test case to your main method so you can check your result
    in eclipse without having to resubmit. When you have the correct output on all known test cases you should resubmit.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double hourlyPayRate = 10;
        double tipRate = 0.2;
        double dailyFoodCost = 10;
        double dailyBeverageCost = 5;
        int dailySleepAndChill = 16;
        double startingCash = 0;
        double randomSpending = 50;

        int maxCredits = maximumCredits(hourlyPayRate, tipRate, dailyFoodCost, dailyBeverageCost,
                                        dailySleepAndChill, startingCash, randomSpending);
        int expectedResult = 14;
        if(maxCredits == expectedResult){
            System.out.println("Passed the test case!");
        } else{
            System.out.println("The test case did not pass. Try again.");
            System.out.println("The course TAs are always happy to help in office hours.");
        }
    }
