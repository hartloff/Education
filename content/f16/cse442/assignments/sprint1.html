== Group Points

<p>
    All points for this sprint are graded on a group basis. All group member will share the same grade for sprint 1.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Repository</h4>
<h5>1 point</h5>

    Create a repository for the group project on GitHub and add a README with a
    description of the project.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Meetings and Minutes</h4>
<h5>1 point</h5>

<p>
    Minutes for all meetings are pushed to the group repository. A template will be
    provided to define the format that the minutes must follow as well as their location in the repo.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Prototype</h4>
<h5>1 point</h5>

<p>
    Deliver a working prototype of your project. This prototype must be merged into the master branch in the repo and be
    tagged as release "v0.1.0" in GitHub. This prototype does not have to have any functionality, but should give the end user
    an idea of what the finished software might look like. For example, the prototype can be a GUI with all the proper
    layout, but the buttons don't have any functionality when clicked. The nature of the prototype will vary by project.
    Get creative with how you show the users your vision.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>YouTube Video</h4>
<h5>1 point</h5>
<p>
    Upload a demo of your prototype to YouTube. This video must give an accurate view of the current state of your
    project and show the running prototype. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience to give them an
    idea of what you are going to accomplish this semester. You should not be scrolling through code in this video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes to get credit. This will be strictly enforced. The goal is
    to quickly communicate the status of your project to the end users.
