== Objectives

<ul>
    <li>Collaborate and network with technical individuals and communities</li>
</ul>

== Overview

<p>
    In the current tech industry you will most likely be interacting with multiple communities of software engineers.
    It is no longer sufficient for a professional software engineer to simply write great code. They also need to
    communicate with other engineers about their code, agree on interfaces, understand requirements and use cases, work
    with outside contractors, and present their work to both technical and non-technical audiences.
</p>

<p>
    Up to 20 points will be awarded for interacting with technical individuals and communities. There are a large
    variety of ways to earn points outlined below allowing you to choose your own adventure on your path to 20 points.
    It is expected that all students will be able to easily earn the full 20 points as long as appropriate effort is put
    forth.
    Any tasks completed as a team may have the points divided among the team members (these teams can be different from
    your group for the course project).
</p>

<p>
    Many of the points in this section can be awarded retroactively. If you have been actively working with software
    communities you may already have points from this section.
</p>


<br/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Much of the grading in this section will be subjective and will vary greatly due to the large amount of flexibility
    offered. To avoid frustration, ask any grading questions you may have <em>before</em> completing a task.

== Career Development

<h5>10 Points max</h5>

<p>
    A maximum of 10 points can be awarded if you have been accepted into a professional software engineering community,
    or are making substantial progress towards this end.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Interview (10 Points)</h4>

<p>
    Complete/schedule an interview for an internship or full-time technical position.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Internship (10 Points)</h4>
<p>
    Receive an offer for a technical internship. Will be awarded retroactively if an internship has been already been
    completed.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Full Time Position (10 Points)</h4>
<p>
    Receive an offer for a full-time technical position.
</p>


== Content Creation

<h5>5 Points + 1 Point per Submission; max 10 Points Total</h5>

<p>
    Example: Setup a level creator for a game.
</p>

<p>
    Setup the infrastructure for others to create content for your group project, or another project. The content does
    not have to be technical. The process to
    create content must be appropriately documented such that a developer can create and submit content without asking
    the group
    for clarification. <strike>Content must be submitted via a pull request if it will be added to the
    repository.</strike> Note that you
    don't necessarily have to create tools to assist the generation of the content, but you must clearly define how to
    create content that can be used by the project. This can be done by defining an interface, a protocol, or a spec and
    making the details available for potential content creators.
</p>
<p>
    You must also provide support for anyone submitting
    content and make sure any submitted content is incorporated into the project. You will be awarded 1 additional point
    each time content is added to the project in this way with a maximum of 5 addition points for a total maximum of 10
    points for setting up content creation and incorporating submissions.
</p>

<p>
    Note that within the group project no credit will given for completing non-technical tasks. If your project
    requires non-technical work, such as modeling or manual data collection, this is an opportunity
    to crowd source this work and improve the quality of the project while earning credit.
</p>

<p>
    This cannot be counted for both community credit here if it is used for individual task credit within the group (No
    double dipping on this one).
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Create Content for Other Groups</h4>
<h5>2 Points Each; max 10 Points</h5>

<p>
    Provide content for any project with a content creator setup. Content must be submitted with a pull request if it
    will be added to the teams repository. Multiple submissions may be made for the same project (Example: Creating 5
    levels for a single game project will result in 10 points being awarded).
</p>
<p>
    No credit will be given for creating content for your own project.
</p>

== Collaborate

<h5>5 Points</h5>

<p>
    Complete a task for another group project from this course (not your own group). The project may be from a previous
    semester, but must have originated as a CSE442 project. This must
    not be your own group and the task must have at least the
    same level of involvement as an individual task assigned for a sprint. A pull request must be submitted with the
    completed feature for these points to be awarded. These points may be awarded even if the pull request was denied as
    long as the reason for denial was not related to the quality of the submitted code. For example, if the request is
    denied because the dev team decided they didn't want your feature in the final product these points can still be
    awarded. Judgement calls will be made by the course staff.
</p>

== Open-Source

<h5>10 Points</h5>

<p>
    Contribute to a professional open-source software project and submit
    your
    changes with a pull request. The contribution must have at least
    the same level of involvement as an individual task assigned for a sprint on the in-class project.
</p>

== Hackathon

<h5>5 Points</h5>
<p>
    Compete in an approved hackathon. Actually compete, donâ€™t just register.
</p>
<p>Approved hackathons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://ubhacking.com/">UB Hacking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you would like credit for a hackathon that is not on this list, please notify the course staff for consideration.
</p>

<p>
    These points may also be awarded for volunteering at a hackathon or helping to organize a hackathon.
</p>
<p>
    An additional 5 points will be awarded for ranking the hackathon. The definition of ranking may vary by hackathon.
</p>

== Presentation
<h5>5 Points</h5>

<p>
    Present a software project, not necessarily your group project, at an approved public event. This includes poster
    presentations.
</p>
<p>
    Approved event will be announced on Slack. If you are interested in an event that has not been approved, please
    notify the course staff for consideration.
</p>

== Side Project
<h5>10 Points</h5>

<p>
    Complete, deploy, and post a YouTube video for a project other than your group project. The scope of this project
    can be less than the group
    project, but must be substantial enough to appear on your resume. If the project doesn't appear on your resume, it
    is not substantial enough for credit here. The project must also meet the same deployment and final video
    requirements as
    the group project for this course. Side projects may be completed in groups as long as the scope increases
    proportionately with the group size.
</p>
<p>
    These points can be awarded retroactively as long as the project meets all the criteria. Work completed for credit
    in other courses will not be considered for credit.
</p>
<br/>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is a significant amount of ambiguity as to whether or not a project can count for these points. Please seek
    approval from the course staff before starting a new project for these points. Approval decisions will be made
    on a case-by-case basis and will depend primarily on the scope of the project.
</div>


== Switch Groups
<h5>2 Points</h5>

<p>
    Voluntarily switch groups between sprints. For these points to be awarded both groups must unanimously support the
    change, the switch must not be caused by a conflict of any kind, and there must not be any strange circumstances
    surrounding the switch. You may still switch groups under some of these conditions, but no points will be awarded
    for the switch.
</p>

<p>
    The intent of rewarding such a switch is to encourage you to work with a wider variety of developers and allow you
    to explore more code bases. You could even switch at the end of each sprint to effectively act as a contractor for
    the class, as long as all affected groups and group members are compliant. If this intent is broken in any way, no
    points will be awarded.
</p>


== Academic Community

<h5>max 10 Points</h5>
<p>
    A maximum of 10 points can be earned for behaviour that fosters a sense of community within the academic environment
    at UB.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>CSE442 Community</h4>

    <h5>Points Vary</h5>

<p>
    Perform any task that benefits the class or course as a whole. This can include setting up servers/machines for the
    lab, coordinating a guest speaker from industry, developing tools to be used by classmates, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the wide variety of tasks that can fall under this category, point values will be determined by the course
    instructor on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
    The intent of these points is to reward students who promote a sense of community within the course. Please do not
    ask the course staff for ways to earn points from this section. That would be completely
    against the spirit of these points. Instead, try asking your classmates for ideas.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Course Community</h4>
    <h5>Points Vary</h5>

<p>
    Contribute in a meaningful way to a STEM course other than CSE442. This may include generating content, testing
    homework, providing feedback, guest speaking, answering questions on a course Piazza, providing help to incoming
    freshmen, building infrastructure, etc.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Working for Courses</h4>
<h5>5 Points; max 5 Points</h5>

<p>
    Contribute to a technical course by volunteering as a ninja or working as a TA. Points can be awarded for work in
    a previous semester.
</p>

== YouTube Video
<h5>5 Points Each; max 10 Points</h5>
<p>
    Create and upload a YouTube video on a technical topic. Possibilities include a tutorial on a technical tool, a
    tutorial on specific coding concepts, advice to future students of this course, advice to future STEM students, etc.
</p>

== Wikipedia
<h5>1-4 Points Each; max 10 Points</h5>

<p>
    Contribute to a Wikipedia article related to software. The contribution must follow all of Wikipedia's policies. If
    you contribution is removed for any violation, these points will also be removed.
</p>
<p>
    Point values will be based on the magnitude of the contribution.
</p>

== Research
<h5>5 Points</h5>

<p>
    Work with a technical faculty member on a research level project. More points may be awarded depending on the
    contributions made to the project. The first 5 points will be awarded for attending the research meetings and
    getting up to speed on the progress already made. To earn these points you must be able to describe the technical
    aspects of the project and answer questions about the research to verify that you understand the problem and
    approach.
</p>


== Other

<p>
    If there is something you'd like to do that belongs on this list but is missing, please suggest it to the course
    staff. If approved, it will be added to this list, given a point value, and announced on Slack.
